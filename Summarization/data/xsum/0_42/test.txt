Michael Luciw, 27, from Nottingham, was a passenger in a van that was hit by a Mazda Premacy, being driven the wrong way on the motorway by Albert Kenneth Newman, who also died. Mr Luciw's family said retired people should undergo regular driving tests. Age UK said it was "vital" older people could drive for as long as possible. The family described Mr Luciw, the father of a baby girl, as generous, kind-hearted and a lover of practical jokes. "He had only just turned 27 and he had his whole life ahead of him," said his mum Andrea Shelton. "He was looking forward to his baby's first crawl. Now he will miss all of her life through no fault of his own." "It doesn't feel as if we have lost him - it feels as if he has been taken away from us," said Mr Luciw's brother Simon. "There are so many things that should be put in place so things like this could be avoided. People are driving that shouldn't be on the road. "The older you get, the more your reactions slow down. "There needs to be some sort of test introduced, in a car with a driving instructor, so you get a true reflection of how good a driver you are. "You get a free bus pass once you are in your 60s so people can't say they are going to lose their freedom if they have their licence removed." Mrs Shelton said Mr Luciw, a delivery driver, was on a long-distance journey with a colleague Andy Harrington when the crash happened at 02:00 GMT on 12 October near Kegworth, Leicestershire. Mr Newman's car was heading north on the southbound carriageway. Mr Harrington, who was driving the Ford Transit, said he had not seen Mr Newman's car until the last second. "I managed to swerve slightly towards the crash barrier but there was nothing I could do," he said. "You couldn't even blink that fast. "It lives with me. I still get sleepless nights. It's not something I will ever forget." Mr Harrington, who sustained serious injuries in the crash, said retired drivers should have to undergo medical examinations. "It's up to the government whether they listen to us," he said. "But if that driver hadn't been on the road that morning, Michael would still be here with his daughter." Currently drivers over 70 in the UK must fill in a self-assessment form every three years to renew their licences. The form does not include a medical or driving test. The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) which maintains the database of registered drivers said it had no plans to restrict licensing on the basis of age. "Evidence does not show that older drivers are more likely to cause a serious accident than others," it said. "The rules are clear that all drivers over 70 have to renew their licence every three years and have to tell DVLA about any medical conditions which might affect their driving. "If we find evidence a driver does not meet the appropriate medical standard we immediately remove their entitlement to drive." Caroline Abrahams, charity director of Age UK, said: "We know driving often allows older people to have the independence to get out and about, go shopping and attend appointments so it's vital that older people are supported to continue driving safely for as long as possible."

The family of a man killed in a crash with an 87-year-old who was travelling the wrong way on the M1 have called for older drivers to be retested.
Guide dog Joey, who mainly flies between London Luton and Paphos in Cyprus, has notched up 35 flights with owner Jan Gibson and her husband Roger. Mrs Gibson, from Swindon, said: "The crew and passengers often fuss over Joey and take photos as it's not often you get to see a dog on a plane." Guide and assistance dogs are the only animals allowed on EasyJet flights. Mrs Gibson, who has had the dog for five years, said: "Joey enjoys flying and will usually sleep at my feet through most of the flight, although he does go for a walk halfway through." EasyJet group director Peter Duffy said: "With 35 flights under his collar, he must be one of the most travelled dogs in the country and we are really  pleased Joey, Jan and Roger have chosen to fly with us again and again."	A golden labrador has been named EasyJet's most frequent flying dog by the budget airline.
In the corner of a busy hospital ward, tucked behind a curtain for our arrival, lies Joshua Davies. His face is alert and he's talkative, but take a look down the bed and you can see both his feet and his left hand in casts. A month ago, Joshua fell from a bridge near his home in Pontypridd, fracturing his spine in four places. The reason for the fall? According to Joshua, it was to get away from bullies. He told Newsbeat: "I can remember speaking on the phone to the ambulance telling them 'I can't move my legs'. "They put me on a spinal board, and that's all I can remember from it." Joshua's family said police had been contacted 15 times about attacks on the teenager, who has Asperger's syndrome. South Wales Police said it had carried out "a thorough investigation" into assault complaints and had arrested and bailed three teenagers. The family claims the teenager has been bullied for the last five years, targeted because of his disability, which is a form of autism. "Josh has never really had an identity as such, he's a good lad, he's a pleaser, he would do anything for anyone," said his mother Cheryl Davies. "Because of the Asperger's Joshua struggles with social cues. "When people confront him, if they're nice to him, Joshua thinks they want to be his friend. Which isn't always the case." "He's slowly getting there, and it is giving him a few setbacks when he has those reality checks, although he's trying to stay positive." During his time in hospital, Joshua has had lots of visitors but said it's still hard to take his mind off what happened. "I've got family to come up and see me and friends, and I've got things to entertain me. "But when I am on my own I'm just thinking 'I am lucky to have survived and carry on with my life'." "I was going to be studying electrical engineering, but if I'm not able to stand up I'm going to have to find another course because I won't be able to use the machinery."

Sheikh Ali Salman told the BBC that for national dialogue to be meaningful, the government had to show its willingness to offer "concrete solutions". "We want someone who can speak for the royal family," he said. Crown Prince Salman al-Khalifa is seen as a reformist in a court divided on how to respond to opposition demands. Hardliners - centred around the unelected Prime Minister Sheikh Khalifa bin Salman al-Khalifa, who has been in his post since 1971 - are said to be opposed to a dialogue process which has only just been agreed between the government and six opposition societies. They fear that any concessions will only serve to encourage more demands from opposition leaders they deeply distrust. However, speaking to the BBC during a visit to London, Sheikh Salman insisted that now was the time for dialogue. "We welcome it, we are ready for it," he said. "We believe that dialogue and negotiations are necessary." The al-Wefaq leader acknowledged that many young protesters had lost faith in the main opposition parties. "A lot of young people do not believe that we should ask for permission to go on a demonstration, or that we should call for a constitutional monarchy with this family, which until now is still killing people". But he believed that the only way forward was to work with reformists within the Sunni Muslim royal family, including the US- and UK-educated Crown Prince Salman, who has has long been considered a proponent of accommodation with the country's Shia majority. Sheikh Salman noted that hours before King Hamad brought in Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) troops to restore order and crush dissent on 14 March 2011, the crown prince and opposition had agreed a seven-point plan that would have moved Bahrain towards a constitutional monarchy. "We had an agreement with the crown prince," he said. "The seven principles were announced and then 12 hours later, GCC troops came in and severed the dialogue." Asked about the appointment of Senator John Kerry as US secretary of state, Sheikh Salman said he was "hopeful" that he would "do more than his predecessor", Hillary Clinton. "US policy needs to be more clear and direct. The United States government needs to pressure harder for human rights and democratic practices.  We are told that Mr Kerry has more interest in Bahrain and so we hope he will achieve more." On the UK's approach to the crisis in Bahrain, the al-Wefaq leader was more blunt. "If the UK government and [Prime Minister David] Cameron are serious about putting an end to violence and human rights abuses, then they have to speak out publically. "It is not enough to say: 'We are privately urging reform.' That has been done for years. Unfortunately, the Bahrain government is not listening to these private conversations. "So, the question I would ask the British government is: 'Shall you continue to say it privately and not put public pressure?' This is not, I think, a good policy." Sheikh Salman also reiterated al-Wefaq's position that it would continue to call for "peaceful demonstrations", even though all public gatherings and rallies are currently banned in Bahrain. "It is the only way open to us to put pressure on the government." He also called for the release of 13 opposition leaders and human rights activists who have been sentenced to between five years and life in prison on evidence widely accepted as having been obtained under torture. They were convicted of plotting to overthrow the government. "These people have a lot of followers in the street.  If they are not part of the dialogue than the dialogue will fail."	The leader of Bahrain's main opposition group, al-Wefaq, has called for the crown prince to attend talks aimed at ending nearly two years of unrest.
Syd's Garden will be "laced with little clues" about the singer, according to Stephen Pyle. Designed as a restful area for patients and staff, it will open in the grounds of Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge in 2018. Barrett, a founder member of Pink Floyd, died in 2006 after living locally as a semi-recluse. Read more Cambridgeshire stories here The garden has been designed by sculptor Mr Pyle and Paul Herrington, a garden designer. Their charity, Art Garden Health, creates and maintains green spaces for NHS hospitals at no public cost. Addenbrooke's offered them a plot a year ago - and fundraising got under way. Mr Pyle knew Barrett as a young man when the two began Saturday art classes at Cambridge's Homerton College. They were also members of band Those Without, which toured Cambridge youth clubs and pubs between 1963 and 1965. They studied together at the Cambridge School of Art before Barrett left for London - and Mr Pyle began a career in theatre set design. "Syd's sister said he liked roses," said Mr Pyle. "And there'll be a striped colour theme, which fans will recognise. "The artwork on his first solo album is turquoise and orange, and Paul worked with those colours. "There's also a nod to Abbey Road's crossing." The centrepiece will be a circular sculpture, depicting a teenage Barrett on a bicycle, armed with a guitar and a paint palette. "This was the Syd I knew at art school," said Mr Pyle. "The 18-year-old, the free wheeler. "He wasn't ambitious for glory, just very creative and anarchic. He was very charismatic - and very, very talented." He described Barrett as a "celebrated son of Cambridge", who returned to the city and lived as a recluse until his death in 2006. In October 2016 a specially-designed artwork unveiled in the foyer of the Cambridge Corn Exchange in October 2016, where he played his last live gig. A blue plaque was also dedicated to him in Cambridge as part of BBC Music Day 2017.	A childhood friend of Pink Floyd legend Syd Barrett is developing a hospital garden in his honour.
More than 1,000 tombs and 3,000 ancient settlements were also revealed by looking at infra-red images which show up underground buildings. Initial excavations have already confirmed some of the findings, including two suspected pyramids. The work has been pioneered at the University of Alabama at Birmingham by US Egyptologist Dr Sarah Parcak. She says she was amazed at how much she and her team has found. "We were very intensely doing this research for over a year. I could see the data as it was emerging, but for me the "Aha!" moment was when I could step back and look at everything that we'd found and I couldn't believe we could locate so many sites all over Egypt. "To excavate a pyramid is the dream of every archaeologist," she said. The team analysed images from satellites orbiting 700km above the earth, equipped with cameras so powerful they can pin-point objects less than 1m in diameter on the earth's surface. Infra-red imaging was used to highlight different materials under the surface. Ancient Egyptians built their houses and structures out of mud brick, which is much denser than the soil that surrounds it, so the shapes of houses, temples and tombs can be seen. "It just shows us how easy it is to underestimate both the size and scale of past human settlements," says Dr Parcak. And she believes there are more antiquities to be discovered: "These are just the sites [close to] the surface. There are many thousands of additional sites that the Nile has covered over with silt. This is just the beginning of this kind of work." BBC cameras followed Dr Parcak on her "nervous" journey when she travelled to Egypt to see if excavations could back up what her technology could see under the surface. In the BBC documentary Egypt's Lost Cities, they visit an area of Saqqara (Sakkara) where the authorities were not initially interested in her findings. But after being told by Dr Parcak that she had seen two potential pyramids, they made test excavations, and they now believe it is one of the most important archaeological sites in Egypt. But Dr Parcak said the most exciting moment was visiting the excavations at Tanis. "They'd excavated a 3,000-year-old house that the satellite imagery had shown and the outline of the structure matched the satellite imagery almost perfectly. That was real validation of the technology." The Egyptian authorities plan to use the technology to help - among other things - protect the country's antiquities in the future. During the recent revolution, looters accessed some well-known archaeological sites. "We can tell from the imagery a tomb was looted from a particular period of time and we can alert Interpol to watch out for antiquities from that time that may be offered for sale." She also hopes the new technology will help engage young people in science and will be a major help for archaeologists around the world. "It allows us to be more focused and selective in the work we do. Faced with a massive site, you don't know where to start. "It's an important tool to focus where we're excavating. It gives us a much bigger perspective on archaeological sites. We have to think bigger and that's what the satellites allow us to do." "Indiana Jones is old school, we've moved on from Indy. Sorry, Harrison Ford." Egypt's Lost Cities is on BBC One on Monday 30 May at 2030 BST. It will also be shown on the Discovery channel in the US.	Seventeen lost pyramids are among the buildings identified in a new satellite survey of Egypt.

At the end of Wednesday's trading, the FTSE 100 was down 0.62% or 46.33 points at 7,478.62. Banking stocks were among the top risers, with Lloyds Banking Group up 1.65% and RBS adding 1.35%. Analysts said that struggling Spanish bank Banco Popular's rescue by Santander had given the overall banking sector a boost. On the downside, pharmaceutical companies tumbled. Shire was the biggest faller on the 100-share index, dropping 3.2%. Meanwhile, AstraZeneca lost 1% after its announcement that it had sold the rights for its migraine drug Zomig for $302m. Colin McLean, manager of the UK growth fund at SVM Asset Management, said uncertainty over the outcome of the election so far appeared to be having little impact on investors. "The bigger picture is that international stocks have been doing less well," he said. "Quite a lot of what drove markets last year has gone into reverse over the last six months and investors are looking again at some of the beneficiaries of lower growth and deflation. "That probably drives investors a little bit more than the election," he said. On the currency markets, the pound rose slightly against the dollar, adding 0.33% to $1.2953. It rose 0.61% against the euro to 1.1517 euros.	The FTSE 100 closed slightly lower on the last day of campaigning before the general election.
Bartosz Bialkowski made three good saves to keep Derby out in a first half that the home side dominated. Luke Varney gave Ipswich the lead early in the second half with his side's first real effort when Scott Carson failed to keep out his long-range shot. The result means Derby have still only scored one league goal this season. Derby move out of the bottom three by virtue of goal difference, despite having lost for the third successive match, while Ipswich move up to ninth place. Bialkowski made a great save from Matej Vydra early on before keeping out Craig Bryson's drive from the edge of the box and then stopping James Wilson's effort from long range at the end of the half. Ipswich manager Mick McCarthy made two half-time changes, bringing on Tom Lawrence and Varney, who gave his side the lead eight minutes after his introduction. Former England goalkeeper Carson somehow let the ball creep into the net despite getting two hands to the effort. It was a first goal of the season for Varney, who scored just twice in over two-and-a-half years as a Derby player earlier in his career. Derby tried to break Ipswich's resistance but a combination of brave defending and wasteful finishing - Darren Bent and Will Hughes both missed the target with decent efforts, while Bialkowski made a great save from Nick Blackman in stoppage-time - saw Ipswich come away with the points. Ipswich manager Mick McCarthy: "We've mugged them to be fair. They were better than us, they dominated the first half and for 10 minutes we were hanging on. "But it's all about the stuff I preach to the players and sometimes supporters don't like it when I talk about being resilient and tough, hard working and putting a shift in and it gets ridiculed a bit, but without it you get nothing for me. "We've shown all those qualities tonight and we got blocks in and headers out and they were better, they played better than us but they couldn't score." Derby manager Nigel Pearson: "Mick said to me before the game he felt they'd been mugged on Friday and I think they've probably done that to us. "Of course it's a disappointing night and it's difficult to sell the idea that's okay when you are losing games and to score one goal in the league is a poor return, but I thought the players deserved to win the game. "I thought they played exceptionally well. I felt for the fans and the players but the good thing was I think the fans could see what the players are about and they stuck with them."

The defendants allegedly used "unofficial" company credit cards for luxury purchases, unconnected with their duties as board members. Prosecutors say about €12m (£10.4m; $13.5m) was spent on hotels, fine clothes, entertainment and travel. Mr Rato denies wrongdoing. Bankia was rescued in 2012 at huge public expense. The unofficial credit card purchases were not declared to the tax authorities. The system allegedly started at Caja Madrid bank and was continued by Mr Rato when Bankia was created in 2011. How Spanish activists landed ex-IMF chief in court A member of the governing centre-right Popular Party (PP), Mr Rato resigned as head of Bankia shortly before its near-collapse in 2012. The government bailout of Bankia inflicted losses on 200,000 small investors, who held preferential shares in the bank. Some of them voiced their anger outside the Madrid courthouse on Monday. "You wretches! Stealing money from pensioners!" they shouted at the accused as the trial got under way. Prosecutors are seeking four-and-a-half years in jail for Mr Rato and six years for Miguel Blesa, the former president of Caja Madrid, a bank that was merged with six others in 2011 to create Bankia. If found guilty, Mr Rato could also face a €2.7m fine, and Mr Blesa a fine of €9.3m. Mr Rato headed the International Monetary Fund from 2004-2007. He also served as Spanish economy minister, and his fall from grace helped fuel accusations that the Popular Party was riddled with corruption. Prosecutors say the lavish credit card purchases took place from 2003-2012 - some of them during Spain's financial crisis, when millions of citizens suffered hardship and unemployment soared. Mr Rato's two successors at the top of the IMF have also been caught up in high-profile court cases. French Socialist Dominique Strauss-Kahn took over from Mr Rato in 2007 but resigned in May 2011 to defend himself against charges of attempted rape in New York. Prosecutors dropped the charges later that year, then Mr Strauss-Kahn reached an out-of-court settlement with the hotel maid who accused him. In a separate case last year, he was acquitted by a French court of the charge of "aggravated pimping" in connection with sex parties involving prostitutes. Mr Strauss-Kahn's successor at the IMF, Christine Lagarde, is to go on trial in France in December over a state award of €285m in damages to tycoon Bernard Tapie when she was finance minister. She is accused of "negligence", but denies any misconduct.	Former IMF chief Rodrigo Rato and 64 other bankers have gone on trial in Madrid over an alleged credit card racket at Spain's troubled Bankia bank.

The Â£21.5m Castle Mill development at Port Meadow, by the River Thames, has been widely criticised as ugly and spoiling the view of Oxford's skyline. The Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE) will put its case to a High Court judge on 23 October. The five-storey university blocks provide 439 accommodation units. The flats overlook a Site of Special Scientific Interest and a Scheduled Ancient Monument. CPRE is seeking the judicial review on the basis of Oxford City Council not carrying out an environmental impact assessment. The council has said the challenge was late as the housing had already been built, and it believed the group's claims were unfounded. Helen Marshall, director of CPRE Oxfordshire, said the West Area Planning Committee "should under no circumstances be rushed into making further poor decisions". "We are not yet convinced that the planning condition on contamination has been met," she added. "And the mitigation proposals currently suggested by the university are woefully inadequate to counteract the devastating impact of the buildings on Port Meadow and Oxford's historic skyline. "A few trees growing to approximately half the height of the buildings in 15 years' time will not meet the brief of 'hiding the buildings in summer and softening their impact in winter' "Key issues such as the height of the buildings and light pollution still need to be addressed." A University of Oxford spokesman said it had "thought carefully" about how best to mitigate the impact of the buildings. "Some measures have already been put in place, and discussions with the city council and others are ongoing about what more we can do," he added. "The University will be making representations at the interim hearing in October on the procedural issues raised by the challenge. "In the meantime, we intend to finish and occupy the buildings by the start of the next academic year in October as planned." The city council said last month it was carrying out an independent review into the case. An online petition against the development on Roger Dudman Way has attracted more than 3,000 signatures.	A campaign group has been granted a hearing to examine the case for a judicial review of the decision to build student flats near a beauty spot.
The Online Hate Crime Hub is made up of five specially trained Met police officers who will try to identify, prevent and investigate online abuse. Sadiq Khan said officers would "work with community experts to develop the police's understanding of online hate". It is the first hub of its kind in the UK and will cost Â£1.7m over two years. It is being funded by the Met and the Mayor's Office for Policing And Crime (MOPAC), with Â£452,000 also being contributed by the Home Office Police Innovation Fund. Any online hate crimes reported to police in the capital, including abuse posted on Twitter and Facebook, will be looked into by the unit. Officers will provide referrals to victim support groups and work with police in relevant boroughs to investigate. City Hall said discussions were also under way with social media companies "to develop appropriate online sanctions for perpetrators of online hate". Victoria Wright, a disability and disfigurement rights campaigner in London, who has been subjected to online abuse, called the hub "a much needed initiative that will make a real difference". "It's vital that those of us who are victims of online hate crime receive a robust response from the police," she said.	A police unit to help tackle online hate crime and provide better support for victims in London has been launched by the capital's mayor.
Sky Mobile will offer flexible monthly payment plans and the ability to roll over unused data each month for up to three years. Sky will become a "quad play" provider, offering broadband, television fixed-line telephone and a mobile service. And existing Sky TV customers will not have to pay for calls or texts and can compile playlists of their favourite shows to watch on their mobiles. According to Sky, some 46,000 have pre-registered for the service. The service comes with three data plans: Non-Sky TV customers can add on unlimited calls and texts for £10 per month, or pay for calls and texts on a pay-as-you-use (PAYU) basis. According to Sky, UK consumers use less than half of the mobile data they buy from mobile network operators, adding up to an annual £2bn of wasted data. Stephen van Rooyen, UK and Ireland Sky chief executive, said:  "We felt it was time to shake up the mobile market and give customers a completely new way to manage their mobile plan. "We've designed it based on what people told us they want - it's easy, flexible and transparent and it puts the customer in control." Ewan Taylor-Gibson, a telecoms expert at uSwitch said: "Sky's first mobile offering is very competitive, as long as you're already a Sky TV customer." He compared Sky's Sim-only deal with that already offered by giffgaff, another service that piggybacks on O2's network and allows customers to alter their package depending on their usage. "The key differences between the two are that Sky ties you in for 12 months, while giffgaff users can cancel anytime, and giffgaff also offers unlimited everything for £20 a month, beating Sky's top package, which delivers 5GB," said Mr Taylor-Gibson. Sky's decision to let people roll over data and store it for three years was "both unique and compelling", he said, but it may have to offer bigger data bundles.	Broadcaster Sky is launching its own mobile phone service.
If, and when, their big day comes, it could be an expensive business covering the cost of hotels, caterers, photographers and florists, not to mention clothes, rings and a honeymoon. Campaigners estimate that the average Australian wedding has a price tag of around 35,000 Australian dollars ($27,000; Â£18,000). "The world's expert body on the economic impact of marriage equality, the Williams Institute at UCLA, says the most conservative estimate for the [potential] wedding spend of Australian same-sex couples is A$161m," says Rodney Croome, the national director of Australian Marriage Equality. "It could be as high as A$600m. "On top of this, Australia's failure to achieve marriage equality is a competitive disadvantage when it comes to attracting those skilled migrants and investors for whom non-discriminatory laws are important." This week the campaign for reform in Australia received some high-profile support from Alan Joyce, the openly gay, Irish-born chief executive of the airline Qantas. He told the Sydney Morning Herald: "I've had people coming up to me in the business community and saying that their son, their daughter is finding it tough (being gay), even in this day and age. "Talking about how important it is for a business leader ... to express our views on things. It is a role model thing." The Flying Kangaroo has a long tradition of equality for its staff. Tim Harcourt, an economist at the University of New South Wales Business School, says Australia's national airline has been a beacon of progressive thinking. "When I worked at Qantas they were always ahead of the game in providing benefits for same-sex partners, whether it be travel or superannuation or so on,"  he tells the BBC. "It has worked out pretty well on the basis that having a happy and egalitarian workforce is good for productivity." Other corporate heavyweights are joining the campaign for same sex marriage in Australia. Telecom giant Telstra Qantas and PricewaterhouseCoopers have signed an open letter urging the conservative government to consider the economic benefits of reform. They have been joined by the nation's biggest banks, ANZ, the Commonwealth and Westpac, along with retailer David Jones. The letter states:  "Not only is marriage equality the only truly fair option, but it's also a sound economic option given that a happy workforce is a productive one. "To remain competitive, and to attract top talent from around the world, organisations - and nations - must create a fair and respectful environment for all." Alex Greenwich, an openly gay member of the New South Wales parliament and a former businessman, who ran a recruitment agency before entering politics, believes that employees who are happy and respected at work are more productive. "There have been so many studies done on the importance of diversity within the workplace and the importance of accepting and treating your staff well in the workplace. "It's kind of a no-brainer," says Mr Greenwich, who believes it is time for Australia to shed its reputation for sexual intolerance. "We know that gay and lesbian people are out and open in very senior levels in a number of corporates across the world, and a lot of them are now saying why do we want to go to a country where we'll be treated as a second-class citizen?" The importance of the so-called 'pink dollar' is felt around in the world where reform has been embraced. But this has done little to soften those opposed to change, who argue that any alterations to Australia's marriage laws would be a backward step. "I think it is disappointing when we have big business trying to influence governments, and for big business to use their clout in this way is intimidating," says Wendy Francis, the Queensland director for the Australian Christian Lobby. "What is good for the economy is stable families and that is what we are really wanting to protect in Australia." Bills to allow gay Australians to marry have been rejected by parliamentarians in the past, and there is currently no legislative timetable for further debate in Canberra. The conservative Prime Minister Tony Abbott has deep-seated religious objections, although opinion polls have suggested a majority of voters would be in favour of marriage equality. While there is resistance at a federal level, laws now exist in New South Wales, Tasmania, Queensland, and Victoria, as well as the Australian Capital Territory that legally recognise same-sex unions. Two years ago, New Zealand became the first country in the Asia-Pacific region to legalise same-sex marriages, and the architects of change believe it has had a transformative effect. "All gay and lesbian people that I encounter are holding their heads just a wee bit higher because they know that the law no longer distinguishes between them and our heterosexual counterparts in this area at least," says Kevin Hague, a Green Party MP, who worked on marriage equality campaign. "I know that popular wedding destinations like Queenstown and Rotorua have had a real boom time with same-sex couples from Australia coming over the get married here."	In Australia, at least 18,000 same-sex couples are waiting for the law to change to allow them to get married, according to the University of Queensland.
Rocket Lab's 17m-long (56ft) Electron lifted off from the Mahia Peninsula, in the North Island, the firm said. The test flight was the first launch from New Zealand and is a major first step in an emerging market: launching cheap disposable rockets to carry small satellites and other payloads. The company plans to start frequent commercial launches later this year. Poor weather conditions had pushed the launch into the fourth day of a 10-day window and the Electron finally cleared its pad at 16:20 local time (04:20 GMT). The launch was conducted with no media or spectators permitted, but the company released a video of the lift-off on its Twitter page. "It was a great flight," chief executive Peter Beck said in a statement after the launch, adding though that the rocket did not quite reach orbit, the path on which its future cargo would embark on its revolution of the Earth. "We'll be investigating why, however reaching space in our first test puts us in an incredibly strong position to accelerate the commercial phase of our programme, deliver our customers to orbit and make space open for business." The test launch, one of three planned, did not carry a payload as such, although it was packed with sensor equipment to help engineers understand how the flight performed. Eventually, Rocket Lab says it will be lofting payloads up to 150kg (331lbs) into a 500km-high orbits that go from pole to pole. We're on the cusp of something quite exciting. Innovative companies are packaging really capable technologies into very small, low-cost satellites. Their data will drive myriad new services - from helping city officials keep track of urban development to giving farmers information about the performance of their crops. But if this new wave is to succeed it needs cheaper access to space. At the moment, the economics and flight schedules of these small satellites are still being defined by the availability and price of a ride on a big rocket. Rocket Lab aims to change that. And there others, such as Richard Branson's LauncherOne project. Rocket Lab's second vehicle is already built and set to fly in the next couple months. Keep an eye on the end of the year too because this US/NZ outfit even has a contract to send a small lander to the Moon. Rocket Lab's founder and chief executive Peter Beck is from New Zealand and the firm has a New Zealand subsidiary. The country has less air traffic, compared to say the US, so there is less need for flights to be rerouted every time a rocket is sent to space. New Zealand is also positioned well to get satellites into a north-to-south orbit around Earth. The trajectory takes the rocket out over open water, far from from people and property. The country hopes these favourable factors will help it become a low-cost space hub. Nice touch: The Electron has nine engines on its first stage and one engine on its second stage. They are called Rutherford engines - after the great New Zealand-born physicist Ernest Rutherford (1871-1937), who famously split the atom in 1917. Private and commercial rocket launches are becoming more and more common - the most famous example being Elon Musk and his SpaceX Falcon rockets. But the SpaceX vehicles are huge and are aimed at following in the footsteps of Nasa missions, delivering cargo to the international space station and eventually sending people to Mars. Rocket Lab's goal is to launch what, by comparison, is a tiny rocket for a fraction of the price, but with much more frequency. The Electron is a mere 17m long and 1.2m in diameter. Each launch only costs about $5m. Rocket Lab wants to conduct 50 or more a year. Just to put this all into perspective: SpaceX's current Falcon rocket is a towering 70m and can carry 22,800kg into low-Earth orbit for a standard price of $62m. Rocket Lab's website already allows you to book a slot for your satellite. The cheapest deal is a small cubesat on a rideshare option - prices start at $77,000 (Â£59,280).	An American company has launched a rocket into space from New Zealand, the first from a private launch facility.
Thomas Fendall and Jessica Hussell, who were in a relationship, used their positions within Greater Manchester Police to access restricted material. A court heard they targeted Hussell's ex-boyfriend, who lost his job after he was wrongfully arrested. Fendall was jailed for 19 months and Hussell was sentenced to 16 months. The pair provided false information to the charity Crimestoppers, naming Hussell's former boyfriend as being responsible for a fail-to-stop collision in which another PCSO was injured. Brett Gerrity, senior crown prosecutor for CPS North West, said: "Thomas Fendall and Jessica Hussell, who were in a personal relationship, abused their positions within the police to access restricted material on the police computer system for their own use and to settle a personal grievance. "Fendall used the police computer system to research background information on people he and Hussell knew, and shared information and documents with others. "They provided Crimestoppers with bogus information leading to an innocent man being investigated by the police for attempted murder." He continued: "They also supplied the DVLA with fictitious intelligence, which led to the same man having his driving licence revoked. "He had to prove he was medically fit to drive before his licence could be reinstated two months later." Sergeant Lee Westhead, of GMP's Serious Collision Investigation Unit, said: "The actions of Fendall and Hussell undermine everything that is at the heart of policing in this country." Hussell, 19, from Glossop, and Fendall, 26, from Denton, each pleaded guilty to misconduct in a public office. They also pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice in relation to providing false information to Crimestoppers. Fendall had pleaded guilty to another count of misconduct in a public office and four counts of computer misuse relating to the GMP intelligence system. The pair were arrested in August 2015 after an investigation by GMP's Serious Collision investigation Unit. They were suspended from GMP upon arrest.	Two police community support officers have been jailed for using force computers to try to frame an innocent man for attempted murder.
In addition to original versions of the games, Halo: The Master Chief collection will also include a new visually-upgraded version of Halo 2. Purchasers of the November release are also being promised "beta" access to the multiplayer version of the forthcoming Halo 5. One company watcher said it illustrated the firm was listening to its fans. "I think it's a smart move," said David Scarborough, from GamesTM magazine. "It shows a willingness to satiate the appetite of Xbox hardcore gamers, which is what Microsoft sees the Halo franchise as - it's biggest hardcore gaming franchise. "It also feeds into the hype for the next entry in the series. "But I personally don't think it will be something that will incentivise people who haven't yet bought a new console to buy an Xbox One." Xbox gamers who already bought the titles on earlier versions of the Xbox are being given an added reason to buy the games again: the package will also include access to watch a new live-action series called Halo: Nightfall. The episodes, produced by Ridley Scott, are currently being filmed in Ireland, and are separate to the Steven Spielberg Halo TV series promised last year. While new pre-rendered trailer footage of Halo 5 was shown to the audience at the firm's E3 press conference in Los Angeles, developer 343 Studios was not yet ready to demo gameplay or confirm a launch date. Xbox chief Phil Spencer told the crowd at the Microsoft event  that Halo was the "reason Xbox is here today". He also acknowledged that his firm had changed its strategy to take account of customer feedback - a nod to it abandoning restrictions on the sale of second-hand disks and releasing a cheaper version of the console without its Kinect voice/camera sensor. He pointedly said at the event's outset that this year's conference would be dedicated exclusively to showing off new games, rather than sharing the time to show off other multimedia features. Microsoft's rival Sony had exploited previous attempts to promote the Xbox as both a games machine and a means to control cable TV, pitching the PlayStation 4 as the machine for serious gamers. That move helped the Japanese company to enjoy stronger sales since both machines launched last November. Other new titles on show for the Xbox One included the hyper-reality game Sunset Overdrive, which features a character who skids across rails blowing up people who have been turned into mutants by a poisonous fizzy drink. The colourful game is an Xbox One exclusive and due out later this year. Microsoft Game Studios showed off another new Xbox One exclusive at an earlier stage of development called Phantom Dust - which is billed as a "battle for reality". It had previously released an action-strategy title by the same name for the original Xbox a decade ago. The in-house games publisher also previewed a dragon-fighting title - developed by Japan's Platinum Games - called Scalebound for the new console, and a fresh version of its open-world third-person shooter Crackdown, originally released for the Xbox 360. One expert said offering such distinctive titles could prove critical to Microsoft's attempts to woo those who had not yet upgraded to a "new-gen" console. "Since Xbox dropped the DRM [digital rights management] stuff before launch and then ditched the Kinect as a must-have about a month ago, the actual level of differentiation between PlayStation 4 and Xbox One has really shrunk," said Ed Barton, an analyst at the Ovum consultancy. "So, one of the only differentiators left is exclusive game titles - there's not much left in to pick between them based on hardware." Analysis from E3: Dave Lee, Los Angeles First stop at this year's E3 was the Galen Center, a venue usually used for basketball, where Microsoft rolled out its portfolio for the coming year and a bit. At its heart, the crowd-pleasing announcement of the Halo Master Collection - a complete compendium of the Halo series, plus a "beta" of the latest entry in the series, Halo 5 Guardians. It won the biggest cheer in the arena, for mostly nostalgia purposes. But a new console can't rely on old franchises, even if they are of Halo's calibre. That's where Sunset Overdrive comes in - an (almost) open-world game with a lead character that, at first glance, is more than slightly irritating. While the Xbox event was a typically loud, brash affair - it was intentionally no-nonsense. This was all about games, and the firm has set out a convincing staple for the year ahead, even if it is a little reliant on tried and tested brands. It all points to a strong 2014 and 2015 for Xbox One. It needs to be if it is to claw back some of the ground lost to the PlayStation 4. Tellingly, there was only a brief mention of the Kinect - a peripheral touted last year to be integral to the Xbox One experience. Not so this time - only two titles mentioned the Kinect directly: a dancing game and a baffling music-creation game based on the old Disney film, Fantasia. Later we get to see what Sony has to offer. Square Enix picked the show to premiere a trailer for its next Lara Croft game, called Rise of the Tomb Raider. The character appears to be suffering post-traumatic stress disorder after her previous origins story, but little of the new plot was revealed. Activision was more forthcoming with a long sequence from its forthcoming Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare game, showing soldiers fighting swarms of drones in a battle-hit city. However, there was only a brief glimpse of its star Kevin Spacey in the footage. Several titles on show took advantage of the Xbox's extra processing power to offer fast-paced multiplayer campaigns. They included:	Microsoft is recoding the main games in its Halo series to run on its recently released Xbox One console.
Greenwood, 22, featured in the 2015 Women's World Cup and is the club's eighth signing of the transfer window. "This is a fantastic move for me and I am really enthusiastic about the new season," she told the club's website. "I had a great year at Notts County but this represents an exciting, new challenge and one that I am really looking forward to." The fee, which is undisclosed, is a club record sale for Notts County who "reluctantly" accepted the offer from Liverpool. "We received a significant bid from Liverpool, which was close to our valuation for the player, and considering her wish to leave we reluctantly accepted the offer," Notts County Ladies chief executive Matthew Alexander said.	Liverpool have signed England defender Alex Greenwood from fellow Women's Super League One side Notts County.
Zachary Barker, nine, died in hospital after the collision in Spring Gardens, Leek, in Staffordshire, last Saturday. His mother Stephanie said she wanted others to "benefit from his short life". She said transplants meant "even in death" he could carry on helping. More updates on this story and others in Staffordshire In a statement released by police, she said: "Zachary was just a lovely lad, full of life and joy. The whole family are devastated by the loss and we cannot believe that we will not see him again. "He will remain in our hearts, thoughts and memories forever. "We took the decision to allow his organs to be used for transplant, so that others may benefit from his short life. "He was a tremendous son who was always willing to help everyone and even in death, he will continue to help others". Police said a friend of the family has set up a Just Giving page to assist with the cost of the funeral.	The mother of a boy who died after being hit by a car says allowing her "tremendous" son's organs to be donated will let him "continue to help others".
The Germany midfielder ran onto a lofted pass from Lucas and, with his back to goal, hooked a volley into the top corner. With Jurgen Klopp's side sitting in third, it could prove to be a valuable goal as they push for Champions League football - but was it the goal of the season? Media playback is not supported on this device "We scored a fantastic goal," Klopp said. "Actually, I would love to see it again - everybody is speaking about it. "I only saw it once but it looked already pretty nice. I turned a little early and didn't see it hit the back of the net. "He is a good boy, a good player and he deserves it," added the German manager. Liverpool have not been strangers to special goals this season - with midfielders Jordan Henderson, Sadio Mane and Georginio Wijnaldum all winning Match of the Day's Goal of the Month competition. With 11 goals in 100 career league starts, Can is not the most frequent goalscorer, and the player admitted himself that his strike at Vicarage Road was his best to date. "I have never scored a goal like that - maybe when I was younger. That is the best goal I've ever scored," Can said. "I saw the space and I ran behind and my first thought was that I wanted to head it, then I didn't think too much." Team-mate Adam Lallana, who made his return from injury as an early substitute, said that Liverpool players will be allowing Can to try more acrobatic efforts in training. "He does like to try speculative efforts, and we will not have a pop now after he produced that," said the England midfielder. "It was a 'worldy' goal, worthy of winning any game. "Credit to him, he was brave enough to try it and it flew into the top corner." The goal of the season will be chosen at the end of the campaign. Tottenham's Dele Alli won the award last season for his strike at Crystal Palace, and the last Liverpool man to win the honour was none other than Steven Gerrard for his brilliant winner in the 2006 FA Cup final.	It was only his seventh Premier League goal since arriving from Germany three years ago, but Emre Can's sensational overhead kick was enough for Liverpool to beat Watford on Monday night.
The ex-Middlesbrough assistant, who held the same post at Hartlepool under Colin Cooper from 2013 to 2014, succeeded Ronnie Moore on Wednesday. Moore parted company with Pools after Tuesday's 2-1 home defeat by Stevenage. "The quality I've seen in training, the intensity and the tempo took me by surprise a bit," Hignett told BBC Tees. "I'm walking into a positive situation. Results and performances haven't been the same, the group of players I've seen today are more than capable of beating teams in this league." Former Tranmere and Rotherham boss Moore helped retain Hartlepool's Football League status last term after his appointment in December 2014. However despite a run of four straight wins at the start of the campaign, form tailed off and Hignett will go into Saturday's home game against Yeovil looking for a first win in five with his side four points above the relegation zone. "First and foremost we need to get away from where we are," he added. "I need to get my message across to the team quickly because there will be a change in style." Liverpudlian Hignett is a self-confessed relaxed and jovial character, but says that will have no impact on his performance with reference to Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp. "Tell Jurgen Klopp that [you have to be serious], there's a time to be serious and a time where you don't have to be," he added. "I do like a laugh and a joke, but when I'm serious I'm serious, there's a time and a place. "Training we have to be serious, match-day ultra serious, but after the game - win lose or draw - I'll be me. "If I want to have a laugh and joke afterwards, as long as the result isn't too bad then I will." Since Hignett's last stint on the Pools' touchline, the club has been taken over by JPNG - led by chairman Gary Coxall - from Ken Hodcroft and IOR Limited. "I was really impressed by what he [Coxall] had to say," Hignett added. "What he wants to do with the club in the future, how he wants to grow the club, his vision, he wanted a clear identity for it - everything I'd want to bring to a football club. "For me it was the perfect fit."	New Hartlepool manager Craig Hignett says the situation at Victoria Park is "positive", despite taking over a side third from bottom in League Two.
Dai Young, boss of Premiership leaders Wasps, expects a number of his in-form players to make the cut. "I'd like to think, the way we've played, we'll have a few in there," Young told BBC Sport. "I know [Jones has] had contact with some of the players on a regular basis - we have got a number in the mix." Jones will also name a trimmed down party of approximately 35 for a training camp in Brighton next week. The final squad before the autumn Tests will be named on 26 October, and with injuries to Wasps' James Haskell and Harlequins' Jack Clifford, England currently have a void at open-side flanker. Northampton's Teimana Harrison started there in England's last match - against Australia in Sydney as Jones' men wrapped up a series whitewash - and is set to be named in Friday's squad. But the Wasps' pair of Guy Thompson and Sam Jones have impressed so far this campaign. "There has been a lot of talk about Guy with his form at the start of the season," added Young. "And everyone knows what a big fan I am of Sam Jones - his work-rate is phenomenal." Hooker Tommy Taylor has been "excellent" according to Young, while Wasps number eight Nathan Hughes is likely to be involved having qualified on residency in the summer. Scrum-halves Joe Simpson and Dan Robson have also both stood out in partnership with fly-half Danny Cipriani. Meanwhile, Leicester flanker Will Evans has been touted as a possible solution to England's number seven conundrum. Evans starred for the Junior World Championship-winning Under-20s in the summer, and followed that by being named in an England training squad in August. It is understood Evans is set be named in the EPS on Friday, but his director of rugby at the Tigers, Richard Cockerill, says the 19-year-old should not yet be thrust into the international arena. "Will is not ready to play international rugby," Cockerill told BBC Sport. "The reality is he has started one game for Leicester, and before that he was playing for Ampthill in National One. "Eddie sees him as a project player and is keen to get the transfer from 20s to the senior group - and his potential is huge. "He is a great young player, who is going to be very, very good. But at the moment but he is not ready yet [for Test rugby]." However, Cockerill feels differently about Mike Williams, the Zimbabwe-born Tigers forward, who is a firm part of Jones' plans, and could even make his England debut come November. "Mike Williams has a little bit more experience," Cockerill said of the 24-year-old. "Given the opportunity he is ready to step up to Test match level today."	England coach Eddie Jones will name his 45-man Elite Player Squad squad ahead of the autumn Tests at 10:00 BST on Friday.
Webb had been linked with the role in 2015, with Blatter suggesting at a conference in the Caribbean on Monday that he could be replaced by Webb "in the near future". But Cayman Islands native Webb said: "No, definitely not. That is not my intention or my objectives at this time." Blatter, who has led Fifa since 1998, was speaking off the cuff before a speech to mark the opening of a Concacaf sport summit. The Swiss was introduced incorrectly to an audience of regional political leaders and confederation delegates as "Fifa's vice-president" by a local media officer. Total number of presidents: 8 Current president: Sepp Blatter, since 1998 Previous president: Joao Havelange from 1974 to 1998 Longest time spent in office: Jules Rimet - 33 years from 1921 to 1954 Number of English presidents: 3 - Daniel Burley Woolfall (1906-1918), Arthur Drewry (1955-1961), Stanley Rous (1961-1974) Blatter, 77, stepped up to the lectern and replied to the mistake by telling the media officer and assembled guests: "I think you're a prophet." He then added that there may be a new Fifa president in "the near future" and the next president "could be Jeffrey Webb". After receiving applause, he added: "This would not mean I would be vice-president. Once you have been a horse you don't go back to the stable." Sources close to Fifa have told BBC Sport that the comments should not be taken as a decision by Blatter that he will not stand as a candidate in the next election, scheduled for May 2015, and that all options are still open to him. Blatter told Uefa delegates in 2011 that this would be his final term of office but has this year given strong indications that he may seek a fresh mandate. The comments are the clearest indication so far that Uefa president Michel Platini - considered by many observers to be his most likely successor - is not the man Blatter wishes to see in power after he has left the role. Platini has yet to decide if he will stand in the 2015 election saying recently that he wanted more time to consider the matter. Webb, 49, was elected president of Concacaf in May 2012 following the acrimonious departures of former president Jack Warner and general secretary Chuck Blazer. Now one of seven Fifa vice-presidents, Webb started his time in football governance as president of the Cayman Islands Football Association in 1991.	Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football leader Jeffrey Webb says he has "no intention" of replacing Sepp Blatter as Fifa president.
Julian Lewis, chairman of the Defence Select Committee, said the former prime minister had "charm and ability". But he had "dangerously" delayed renewing Trident, Mr Lewis said, also questioning Mr Cameron's roles in Libya, Brexit and armed forces cuts. The ex-PM was mooted as Nato secretary-general over the Christmas period. The incumbent, former Norwegian Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg, is due to stand down within the next couple of years. In a speech as part of the Speaker's Lecture series, Mr Lewis said: "During the Christmas recess, an obviously planted story appeared in a tabloid newspaper suggesting that our most recent former prime minister should be the UK's candidate as next Nato secretary-general. "It was duly taken up by the wider media, with heavy hints suggesting that Number 10 was actively considering the proposal." He added: "David Cameron is a man of charm and ability. He deserves to find a role commensurate with his talents, and I am sure that he will. "But those talents do not include wisely judging strategic issues, whether when toppling Arab dictators in places like Libya, increasing military commitments whilst cutting the armed forces, predicting a Third World War in consequence of Brexit, or dangerously delaying the renewal of Trident for the sake of coalition politics - as he did." Mr Cameron resigned as prime minister last summer after his Remain campaign lost the EU referendum. He stood down as MP for Witney, Oxfordshire, in September. In an interview with the Times, published on Monday, US President-elect Donald Trump branded Nato "obsolete" for failing to adapt to the threat posed by terrorism, but he also said the 28-member military alliance was "very important". Mr Lewis warned that if the US turned away from the organisation, Europe would have "little chance" of deterring non-nuclear threats. But he claimed Mr Trump was trying to strengthen the alliance by confronting countries which failed to meet the membership requirement of spending more than 2% of GDP on defence. Mr Lewis said: "It seems to me far more likely that, by confronting the 'free-riders' within the alliance, he actually aims to strengthen Nato by ensuring that all its members properly fund their armed forces in the future."	David Cameron should not become leader of Nato as his "talents do not include wisely-judging strategic issues", a senior Conservative MP has warned.
Arthur Cave, 15, was found with multiple injuries on the underpass of Ovingdean Gap in July. He died later at the Royal Sussex County Hospital. Sussex Police said his death was not suspicious, and the coroner ruled it was "accidental". Nick Cave, 58, is an Australian songwriter and is best known as lead singer of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds. Mr Cave and his wife Susie Bick are at the hearing which is being held in front of Brighton senior coroner Veronica Hamilton-Deeley at Woodvale Crematorium. The inquest heard Arthur had taken LSD with a friend and he was seen "staggering" on his own before he fell off the cliff. Members of the public tried to resuscitate him after he was found lying on the ground without any shoes or socks on. During evidence given by pathologist Dr Simi George, Ms Hamilton-Deeley asked: "The history you had was that LSD was used?" Dr George replied: "Yes." The cause of death was given as "multiple traumatic injuries due to a fall from a height". Recording a conclusion of accidental death, Ms Hamilton-Deeley, said: "I expect the decision and planning to take LSD, or a hallucinogenic drug likely to be LSD, was made on the spur of the moment. "It's clear he could not know what was real and what was not real. "It's completely impossible to know what was in Arthur's mind and what he was seeing." In a statement issued after the inquest, the Cave family said they had been "overwhelmed" by the messages of support from people "in Brighton and beyond". It read: "Arthur was a wonderfully unruly, creative and free-spirited young man with an infectious, happy, funny daredevil nature. "He loved his friends and family, idolised his twin brother Earl and was never far from his side."	Musician Nick Cave's teenage son took LSD before he fell off a cliff in Brighton, an inquest has heard.
It is the third time Vitalmiro Bastos Moura has been tried for Dorothy Stang's 2005 death after previous convictions were overturned. Ms Stang, 73, campaigned for 30 years to save rainforest from the interests of wealthy landlords. She had tried to block Moura's attempts to seize land and was shot six times. Moura, who was convicted in 2007 and 2010 in verdicts that were subsequently overturned, was sentenced to 30 years in prison. In the latest trial, the judge said Moura had acted in a cold-blooded and cowardly manner. Prosecutors earlier said Moura and another rancher had hired gunmen to kill Ms Stang. Moura's lawyers argued there wasn't enough evidence linking him to the crime. The death of Ms Stang in the northern state of Para became a symbol of the violent conflict for natural resources in Brazil's Amazon region. In the past 30 years, more than 1,000 people have been killed in land disputes in Brazil, with some two-thirds of the murders happening in Para. Ahead of the latest verdict, Ms Stang's sister, Barbara Richardson, said the repeated trials had been upsetting but had helped maintain a spotlight on the issues. "That keeps the injustice of the system before the people's eyes," she told AP. "Dorothy is ever prominent. The people understand what happened to her and what this means."	A Brazilian court has convicted a rancher for ordering the murder of an American nun over a land dispute - a case that caused international outrage.
The Gran Fondo was in the city for the first time, giving riders the option of taking on a 100 mile (160km) course or a shorter 37 mile (60km) route. Plymouth based cyclist Jonathan Tiernan-Locke, who is serving a two-year doping ban, was among the riders. The Sky Ride offered families the chance to cycle a 5 mile (8km) tour of the city.	Thousands of bikers in Devon took to the streets as two big cycling events came to Plymouth.
It goes on. A first Olympic diving gold, a first Olympic gymnastics gold, and then a second, from the same man, a few hours later. Multiple Formula 1 world titles, Lions series won. The first woman in history to win an Olympic boxing gold, the first to retain one too. And now another bequest, from a man who has already provided so much. A British tennis player as world number one is an idea as ludicrous to recent memory as anything else in that giddy list, but with Andy Murray, we should no longer be surprised. To a nation systematically unable to produce tennis champions despite finances and facilities at the elite level to embarrass others as well as itself, Murray is the gift that keeps giving. Only 26 men have held that solitary ranking since the calculations went computerised 43 years ago. It is not a gimmick, or a marketing exercise, or even a reward in itself, but a defining benchmark. You cannot fluke it or get lucky with a judging panel. It is deserved. It is definitive. "Being number one is the pinnacle of all the ambitions of every player," said Novak Djokovic, the man just deposed, when he began his own long reign three years ago. "This is the dream." It hasn't made every player happy. The only certain thing about being world number one is that the day will come when you will no longer be world number one. Andre Agassi has described how miserable it made him, how the achievement seemed to legitimise his father's cruel ambitions and obsessions rather than his own. John McEnroe, who spent a cumulative total of 170 weeks at the top of the pile, found it lonely atop the exposed summit. "You're out there on your own island," he once said. "And you feel like you're disengaged, not only with the rest of the world, but the rest of your competitors, some of them friends." Media playback is not supported on this device Climbing the mountain is often an easier task in sport than defending your splendid isolation. The England rugby union team who won the World Cup in 2003, having gone into that tournament as Grand Slam winners and on an unbeaten home run stretching back 22 games and four years, finished third in the subsequent Six Nations and fourth in the next two. "In a game, thousands of decisions are being made, but it only needs a few to be the wrong ones for the team's fortunes to reverse," says Matt Dawson, scrum-half in that team. "When it goes, it goes quickly." It was the same for the England cricket team who rose to number one in the Test rankings after beating India in the summer of 2011: whitewashed in their next Test series, against Pakistan in the UAE, and then dismantled at home to South Africa the following summer, losing their captain Andrew Strauss and, for a while, their star batsman Kevin Pietersen. Being world number one gets you respect. It also makes you a target. Everyone wants your scalp. Every defeat is automatically a headline. Even your own motivation can begin to slide, if only subconsciously, if only by minute fractions. How to focus on the next target when you can climb no further? Where can you go from the top but down? Murray's character may insulate him from those uncertainties for a while yet. Find out how to get into tennis in our special guide. The 29-year-old's new position reflects both his own remarkable consistency over the past 12 months and the personal and physical problems that have shackled Djokovic, but it is also testament to a desire for self-improvement only occasionally found in sportsmen of his age. Ranked 17th in the world a decade ago, he was gloriously log-jammed at four in those four seasons from 2008 to 2011, the unprecedented trio of Djokovic, Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal seeming to block any further ascent. He dropped to sixth in 2014 after his back surgery and then appeared stymied at second for the past year as 12-time Grand Slam champion Djokovic went through the peak of his reign. The belief and the hard work never dropped off. Different coaches, tweaked training, a renewed focus on the basics that, in this year alone, has seen his second serve refashioned and accelerated. In defeat by Kei Nishikori in the US Open quarter-finals in September and Juan Martin del Potro in the Davis Cup semi-finals soon afterwards, he seemed physically spent - only to emerge revitalised in the past two months on this celebrated spree across first east Asia and now western Europe. And it is testament to self-belief too - that in an era decorated by three of the greatest players of all time, he could be crowned the best; that seven years and two months after first reaching number two, he could still take that final special step. Plenty of fine Grand Slam-winning players have never been world number one, Michael Chang, Goran Ivanisevic and Michael Stich among them. Many who have got there are arguably now in Murray's shadow: Pat Rafter, Carlos Moya, Marcelo Rios; definitely Yevgeny Kafelnikov and Thomas Muster; quite possibly Marat Safin and Andy Roddick, Ilie Nastase, Gustavo Kuerten and Lleyton Hewitt too. Rankings in sport do not always reflect the accepted wisdom. Angelique Kerber may sit above Serena Williams in the women's tennis rankings, but with Williams having won five of their past six meetings and seven times as many career titles, the debate over who is the better player would be short. Triathlon's world rankings, based only on the year's World Series results, have Spain's Mario Mola as world number one, when every judge in the sport would define double Olympic champion Alistair Brownlee as the best in the world. Few could dispute Nick Faldo's claim to be the best golfer in the world when he topped golf's rankings. A few days after going to number one himself, Ian Woosnam would win the Masters. Luke Donald's ascension in 2011 was deserved - he was the first player in history to win the money title on both European and PGA tours in the same season - but because he had never finished as runner-up in a major, let alone won one, there were those who disputed the algorithm's accuracy. So too with Lee Westwood, number one in the same year, still to win a major five years on. The number alone can be less important than the aura a player brings to it. After an unparalleled 12 months - that Davis Cup triumph, winning BBC Sports Personality for the second time, reaching his first French Open final, winning his second Wimbledon, taking Olympic singles gold yet again - Murray has that too. Media playback is not supported on this device And this may yet be the start of something even more beautiful, rather than the pinnacle. After five defeats in the Australian Open final, never will Murray have a better chance of winning it than this January, Federer and Nadal faded, Djokovic - his nemesis in four of those finals - jaded. The French Open title could conceivably be the next unprecedented prize to be pouched. And then Wimbledon again, and why not, after all that has been before? It is dreamy, fanciful stuff. But that has been Murray's motif: ripping up precedent, making the impossible real.	This has been the era where British sport has blessed its loyal followers like never before: fourth, third and second places in the Olympic medal table; the Tour de France yellow jersey won in four of the past five years; the miracle of a first male Wimbledon champion in 77 years, a marvel repeated three years on; the Davis Cup won for the first time since tennis was played in slacks and cable-knit jumpers.
Nottinghamshire Police were present when the man fell from a building in the Radford area of Nottingham on Friday evening. A witness told the Nottingham Post he survived the first fall before running to another flat and falling again. Police are not treating the death of the man, in his mid-30s, as suspicious. Officers were called to Waterloo Road at about 19:30 GMT.	The death of a man who twice apparently jumped from a building has been referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission.
Police said Kinga Pelc from the east Belfast area died in hospital on Saturday. A man in his 20s remains in a critical condition in hospital following the incident. It happened on the Annadale Embankment at about 15:00 BST on Friday. Two other people were taken to hospital for treatment to their injuries after the crash. Their injuries are not believed to be life-threatening.	A 21-year-old woman has died following a crash involving two cars in south Belfast.
Fujimori said in a letter he intended to share thoughts and memories, happy and sad, while serving a 25-year prison sentence for human rights violations. The social media accounts would be managed by a group of supporters. The 75-year-old governed Peru for a decade before being impeached and fleeing the country in 2000. Peru's Justice minister, Daniel Figallo, reacted angrily to Fujimori's announcement. "People who commit violations and have their liberty taken from them have their rights limited. Otherwise, we turn prisons into hotels," he told reporters. Mr Figallo reportedly asked the prison director to limit Fujimori's access to social media. The former leader still has supporters in Peru and vowed to reveal his thoughts online. "In this way, I'll be able to share my thoughts, memories and illusions,  sorrows and joys," his letter read. Peru's President Ollanta Humala recently rejected Fujimori's request for a pardon on humanitarian grounds. Earlier this week, the authorities rejected a bid by Fujimori's lawyer to have him  transferred to house arrest. After being stripped of his powers by the country's Congress in 2000, the leader sought exile in Japan. He eventually returned to Chile, where he was arrested in 2005. After losing a lengthy legal battle, he was extradited to Peru in 2007 and convicted of human rights violations after a 15-month trial. He was accused of authorising death-squad killings in two incidents known as La Cantuta and Barrios Altos, and the kidnapping of a journalist and a businessman. Mr Fujimori repeatedly denied the charges, saying they were politically motivated.	The former president of Peru, Alberto Fujimori, has said he will publish excerpts from his memoirs on the social media websites Twitter and Facebook.
Relatives say they have evidence that she was murdered as part of a policy of deliberately killing journalists. The wrongful death lawsuit was filed at a district court in Washington DC. Colvin was reporting from the rebel-held area of Baba Amr, in Homs, in February 2012, when she was killed by government artillery. Shortly before, she did live broadcasts for the BBC, Channel Four and CNN. "I watched a little baby die today," she said, talking over pictures of a child who had been hit by a sniper bullet. "That is happening over and over and over." She told the BBC that President Assad's forces were "shelling with impunity, with merciless disregard for civilians". She told CNN it was "a complete and utter lie that they're only going after terroristsâ€¦ The Syrian army is simply shelling a city of cold, starving civilians". The Colvin family believes that the satellite phone used in these broadcasts was traced by Syrian intelligence and used to locate the Baba Amr media centre, where she was based. According to documents obtained by their lawyers, a government informant then confirmed the location. An attack on the journalists was ordered that night, the lawsuit says. "The transmissions were intercepted, and they were tracked to their GPS co-ordinates," said one of the legal team, Scott Gilmore. "On top of that there was a whole web of informants who were already out searching for the journalists. Any journalist in Homsâ€¦ could have been a target". Marie's photographer, Paul Conroy, had told the BBC shortly after the attack that the incoming rounds were "bracketed" on the media centre, meaning they were being deliberately targeted. Conroy had served in an artillery regiment in the British Army. "As an artilleryman, I think that was a good day's work for a for a well-trained team. Nothing smacked of randomness in that situation," he said. Now the family's lawyers say they have witnesses and documents smuggled out of Syria to prove this. The lawsuit is the fruit of four years of research by the US-based Center for Justice and Accountability. The documents are said to show that the artillery strike was approved or ordered by President Assad's brother Maher, commander of the Republican Guards. The policy of targeting journalists is alleged to have been made by senior officials in the Central Crisis Management Cell, President Assad's war cabinet. "I'm really proud to be able to bring this lawsuit," said Marie Colvin's sister, Cat. "We know who Marie's killers are now; we want them brought to justice. I want them to be held accountable." She went on: "I'm very sensitive to the suffering of the Syrian people. I know I'm not the only one who's lost a sister and my mom is not the only one who is mourning the loss of a daughter. "I'm in a unique position to be able to use the court to be able be bring Marie's killers to justice. I want to give a voice to the Syrian people. I want them to know we haven't forgotten them." The shelling in Baba Amr was the most intense any of us in the BBC team had ever seen. The Syrians there were all wondering if this would be another Hama - the town destroyed by the old President Assad's artillery in 1982. Some 10,000-20,000 people were killed - there is still no accurate estimate - but not a single image was published of the carnage. In the age of the cameraphone and YouTube, that was not going to happen in Baba Amr. But - we believed - the regime still feared what effect the presence of international journalists would have. "We could destroy Baba Amr in 10 minutes, if there were no cameras," a regime official is supposed to have said, according to documents and witness statements obtained by the Colvin family's lawyers. The lawsuit says Marie was deliberately murdered according to orders given by some of the most senior officials in the Syrian regime. One of those who helped carry out the attack is said to have been rewarded by the Assad family with the gift of a car. These are allegations, yet to be tested in court. But the murder of journalists is just one war crime among many of which the regime stands accused. The Colvin family hopes the lawsuit will be a reminder of that - as some in the international community seek to rehabilitate President Assad.	The family of Marie Colvin, the American journalist who died in Syria four years ago, is suing the regime of President Bashar al-Assad.
"Golden Rice" has been developed by scientists to combat vitamin A deficiency, which affects millions of children in the developing world. The crop was just weeks away from being submitted to the authorities for a safety evaluation. But a group of around 400 protestors attacked the field trial in the Bicol region and uprooted all the GM plants. The project to develop Golden Rice was started 20 years ago in 1993 by German researchers with funding from the Rockefeller Foundation. The rice has been modified by adding extra genes that turn on the plant's ability to produce beta-carotene, which humans can convert into vitamin A. A lack of this vitamin increases the chances of blindness and susceptibility to disease. Vitamin A deficiency is a significant problem among children in developing countries. According to Helen Keller International, around 670,000 children will die each year from the problem, while 350,000 will go blind. It is estimated that one cup of Golden Rice could provide half an adult's recommended daily intake. Golden Rice field trials are currently being carried out in the Philippines under the auspices of the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), together with PhilRice, the local research body. Five small test plots have been planted with the idea that there would shortly be a submission to the regulatory authority of the Philippines. It was hoped that initial releases to farmers could happen in 2014. The plot in Bicol was guarded and fenced but the protestors broke through the security and uprooted and trampled the rice plants. The attackers who were members of a group called Sikwal-Gmo say they attacked the crop because they believe that GM technology is not the solution to malnutrition in the Philippines. The protestors argue that international agrochemical corporations and the US are behind the drive for Golden Rice. In a statement, they said they were concerned that the rice trial was both a danger to human health and biodiversity. The scientists involved with the trial say they were relieved that no-one was hurt during the incident. "It was not completely unexpected as we had heard threats," the IRRI's Dr Bruce Tolentino told BBC News. "It was certainly disappointing to have our field trial vandalised because our Golden Rice research aims to avoid the horrible plight of women and children suffering vitamin A deficiency." The researchers say that the development of the modified rice remains critical for the Philippines as 1.7 million children in the country aged under five are affected by vitamin A deficiency. They say they are determined to go ahead with the project. "This is not a major setback, because it is just one trial of a series and just one of several sites. We remain completely committed to continuing our Golden Rice research to help improve people's nutrition," said Dr Tolentino. The development of GM technology is highly contentious in the Philippines. Earlier this year, the Court of Appeals rejected another crop, an eggplant that had been modified to produce toxins to a pest. The court ruled that the crop violated the constitutional rights of Filipinos to health and a balanced ecology. Follow Matt on Twitter.

Although such an event should have been predicted and planned for, the panel said, it found gaping holes in safety standards and emergency procedures. Here is an outline of key quotes, findings and recommendations from the 88-page executive summary of the Nuclear Accident Independent Investigation Commission's report. The earthquake and tsunami of March 11, 2011 were natural disasters of a magnitude that shocked the entire world. Although triggered by these cataclysmic events, the subsequent accident at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant cannot be regarded as a natural disaster. It was a profoundly manmade disaster - that could and should have been foreseen and prevented... Our report catalogues a multitude of errors and wilful negligence that left the Fukushima plant unprepared for the events of March 11. And it examines serious deficiencies in the response to the accident by Tepco, regulators and the government. For all the extensive detail it provides, what this report cannot fully convey - especially to a global audience - is the mindset that supported the negligence behind this disaster. What must be admitted - very painfully - is that this was a disaster "Made in Japan." Its fundamental causes are to be found in the ingrained conventions of Japanese culture: our reflexive obedience; our reluctance to question authority; our devotion to 'sticking with the program'; our groupism; and our insularity. (Chairman Kiyoshi Kurokawa) Collusion and lack of governance The Tepco Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant accident was the result of collusion between the government, the regulators and [private plant operator] Tepco, and the lack of governance by said parties. They effectively betrayed the nation's right to be safe from nuclear accidents. Therefore, we conclude that the accident was clearly "manmade"... We believe that the root causes were the organizational and regulatory systems... rather than issues relating to the competency of any specific individual. [All parties] failed to correctly develop the most basic safety requirements - such as assessing the probability of damage, preparing for containing collateral damage from such a disaster, and developing evacuation plans for the public in the case of a serious radiation release. Organisational problems within Tepco Had there been a higher level of knowledge, training, and equipment inspection related to severe accidents, and had there been specific instructions given to the on-site workers concerning the state of emergency within the necessary time frame, a more effective accident response would have been possible... Sections in the diagrams of the severe accident instruction manual were missing. Emergency response issues The government, the regulators, Tepco management, and the Kantei [prime minister's office] lacked the preparation and the mindset to efficiently operate an emergency response to an accident of this scope. None, therefore, were effective in preventing or limiting the consequential damage. In the critical period just after the accident, the Kantei did not promptly declare a state of emergency. The regional nuclear emergency response team was meant to be the contact between the Kantei and the operator, responsible for keeping the Kantei informed about the situation on the ground. Instead, the Kantei contacted Tepco headquarters and the Fukushima site directly, and disrupted the planned chain of command. Evacuation issues The Commission concludes that the residents' confusion over the evacuation stemmed from the regulators' negligence and failure over the years to implement adequate measures against a nuclear disaster, as well as a lack of action by previous governments and regulators focused on crisis management. The crisis management system that existed for the Kantei and the regulators should protect the health and safety of the public, but it failed in this function. The central government... failed to convey the severity of the accident... [O]nly 20% of the residents of the town hosting the plant knew about the accident when evacuation from the 3km zone was ordered at 21:23 on the evening of March 11. There was great confusion over the evacuation, caused by prolonged shelter-in-place orders and voluntary evacuation orders. Some residents were evacuated to high dosage areas because radiation monitoring information was not provided. Continuing public health and welfare issues [R]esidents in the affected area are still struggling from the effects of the accident. They continue to face grave concerns, including the health effects of radiation exposure, displacement, the dissolution of families, disruption of their lives and lifestyles and the contamination of vast areas of the environment. ... The Commission concludes that the government and the regulators are not fully committed to protecting public health and safety; that they have not acted to protect the health of the residents and to restore their welfare. Approximately 150,000 people were evacuated in response to the accident... Insufficient evacuation planning led to many residents receiving unnecessary radiation exposure. Others were forced to move multiple times, resulting in increased stress and health risks - including deaths among seriously ill patients. "If there had been even a word about a nuclear power plant when the evacuation was ordered, we could have reacted reasonably, taken our valuables with us or locked up the house before we had left. We had to run with nothing but the clothes we were wearing. It is such a disappointment every time we are briefly allowed to return home only to find out that we have been robbed again." (Comment by a resident of Okuma, from report appendices) Regulator failures The regulators did not monitor or supervise nuclear safety... They avoided their direct responsibilities by letting operators apply regulations on a voluntary basis. Their independence from the political arena, the ministries promoting nuclear energy, and the operators was a mockery. They were incapable, and lacked the expertise and the commitment to assure the safety of nuclear power. Operator failures Tepco did not fulfil its responsibilities as a private corporation, instead obeying and relying upon the government bureaucracy of Meti, the government agency driving nuclear policy. At the same time... it manipulated the cosy relationship with the regulators to take the teeth out of regulations. Shortcomings in laws and regulations Laws and regulations related to nuclear energy have only been revised as stopgap measures, based on actual accidents. They have not been seriously and comprehensively reviewed in line with the accident response and safeguarding measures of an international standard. As a result, predictable risks have not been addressed. The existing regulations primarily are biased toward the promotion of a nuclear energy policy, and not to public safety, health and welfare. The unambiguous responsibility that operators should bear for a nuclear disaster was not specified. There was also no clear guidance about the responsibilities of the related parties in the case of an emergency. No 'cosmetic solutions' Replacing people or changing the names of institutions will not solve the problems. Unless these root causes are resolved, preventive measures against future similar accidents will never be complete... The underlying issue is the social structure that results in "regulatory capture," and the organisational, institutional, and legal framework that allows individuals to justify their own actions, hide them when inconvenient, and leave no records in order to avoid responsibility.	A Japanese parliamentary panel has delivered a damning verdict after investigating the accident at the Fukushima nuclear plant which followed an earthquake and tsunami on 11 March 2011.
In less than 24 hours, the country's chosen to leave the European Union, abandoning an institution, a concept that's been part of the fabric our institutions since the 1970s. As a result, the prime minister has left his job. Some Labour MP s are trying to unseat their leader. And Scotland faces another referendum on the other union. Tonight it's not clear who'll be running the country in three months time. It's not certain if the leader of the opposition will stay in post beyond the weekend. But remember, this was not an overwhelming surge to one side. Decisive yes, but a move in the margins. Yet in a referendum - a binary vote - that produces a result that could change everything for generations. It is not so much that politics has been turned upside down - but the conventional rules, the expectations - have been scrapped by one decision. The prime minister's judgement, his mistaken analysis of how to win the public over, cost his job. And almost the entire establishment's appeal to the electorate was rejected. One member of the cabinet pointed to the problem: "they don't believe us". Right now, it is not at all inevitable that's a problem the current generation of politicians will ever be able to fix.	Tourists and members of the public drifted to Westminster's College Green - to witness this day, and also, perhaps, just to make sense of what's going on.
Kevin McGuigan Sr was shot dead at his home at Comber Court in the Short Strand on Wednesday. Police believe two men shot him several times in the head and chest at point blank range before running off. The BBC understands the 53-year-old was one of a number of suspects in the murder of Gerard 'Jock' Davison in May. Sinn Féin has denied speculation that Provisional IRA may have been involved in his murder. The DUP said there will be "repercussions" if that is the case. Mr McGuigan, a father-of-nine, was taken to the Royal Victoria Hospital but died a short time later. BBC Northern Ireland home affairs correspondent Vincent Kearney said Mr McGuigan was killed by two masked men using semi-automatic weapons in a "professional, execution-style killing". Appealing for information, the officer leading the murder investigation said the gunmen were on foot and wearing dark clothing with their faces covered. "We need to hear from anyone who has information about the events of last night, about the movements of the gunmen both leading up to and immediately after the shooting," said Det Ch Insp John McVea. Mr McGuigan had been questioned by police after the murder of Jock Davison in the Markets area of Belfast three months ago. Mr Davison, 47, was a former IRA commander and a former friend of Mr McGuigan. The IRA pair were also founding members of the paramilitary group Direct Action Against Drugs (DAAD), which killed more than a dozen alleged drug dealers. They were later involved in a feud, and Mr McGuigan was shot several times in a so-called punishment attack. It was claimed that Mr Davison gave the order for that attack on his former friend. Det Ch Insp McVea said police were "aware of speculation around a possible motive" for the murder of Mr McGuigan. The detective said that in the investigation into the murder of Mr Davison, Mr McGuigan was questioned "as a potential witness, not a suspect", and this was still the police's position. "Speculation is not helpful and is potentially dangerous," he said. "People should allow the police investigation to take its course and provide any information they have to detectives." However, the police officer did not go as far as entirely ruling him out as a suspect. "I am saying the investigation team into the murder of Jock Davison would remain open minded as to who is responsible," he told a news conference. The detective also appealed for "those with influence in the community to use all their efforts to reduce tension and appeal for calm and restraint at this very difficult time". The victim's elderly mother, Margaret McGuigan, told the BBC that her son's killers would have to live with what they had done. She added there had been "too many murders" in the area and that she hoped her son's would be the last.	A former Provisional IRA member murdered in front of his wife was shot dead in a "ruthless and premeditated killing", police have said.
About 1,000 people gathered to observe a minute of silence and light candles in front of the Senedd. There are over 2,000 French people living in south Wales registered with the French consulate in London. Marie Brousseau-Navarro, the Honorary Consul of France in Cardiff, said messages of support had been touching. She said: "We are united in shock and united in sorrow... And united with all the people who have marched across the world." Saleem Kidwai, chairman of the Muslim Council of Wales was applauded by the crowd as he told them to "stand together shoulder to shoulder". "My condemnation is absolute," he said. "We will eventually win and truth wins over falsehood and light over darkness." First Minister Carwyn Jones was among the many to hold up a candle for the silence, while others held up pencils. The silence was marked at the end by an applause. Earlier, he said: "The vigil in Cardiff Bay tonight is an opportunity for the people of Wales to pay their respects to those who lost their lives in the truly abhorrent attack in Paris. "It is also a chance to show solidarity with the people of France and all those who believe in upholding our democratic values and freedoms that are threatened by such senseless acts of terror." Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb tweeted earlier: "Standing with the French community in Wales and in support of freedom of speech everywhere. 6pm this eve. Senedd, Cardiff. #CharlieHebdo" In a show of unity, London landmarks have been lit in the colours of the French national flag. And world leaders have gathered in Paris for a huge unity march involving over one million people, dwarfing Saturday's marches that saw 700,000 take to the streets. On Saturday, Swansea City striker Bafetimbi Gomis dedicated his side's goal in the 1-1 draw with West Ham to the victims of the Paris terror attacks. Wales' police forces and media organisations held a minute's silence to support those attacked in the Charlie Hebdo massacre in Paris on Wednesday. A police officer was killed on Thursday and French forces stormed two separate hostage sites in and around Paris, killing three hostage takers, on Friday. "We have been really moved by the hundreds of messages of support and condolences," said Ms Brousseau-Navarro. "Most of all we appreciate the support and solidarity."	A vigil has taken place in Cardiff Bay for French citizens and others following terror acts in Paris which left 17 people dead in three days.
The detective leading the enquiry said the soldiers are not obliged to speak to the police because they are being treated as witnesses and not suspects. Thirteen civilians were killed when soldiers opened fire on a civil rights march in Londonderry in 1972.  A 14th died later. Police resumed their investigation into the killings in January.. The information about 100 soldiers being contacted emerged on Thursday following fresh criticism of the police investigation by some Bloody Sunday families. Det Ch Insp Ian Harrison, from the PSNI's Legacy Investigations Branch, said his team completed its "civilian witness enquiries" and made contact with more than 100 soldiers to "determine if they are willing to engage with us". "It should be noted that these soldiers are witnesses, not suspects, and are therefore not obliged to speak with us," said Mr Harrison. "The next stage of the investigation would be to interview those soldiers who are willing to engage with the enquiry team as witnesses." Mr Harrison said his team of officers was also carrying out a number of other enquiries in relation to the investigation which he described as a "long, complex and protracted". "I am content with the level of resources I have working on the investigation at this stage. "If at any time further resources are required they will be made available to me." Some Bloody Sunday families criticised the police investigation in a letter to Detective Chief Inspector Ian Harrison from Peter Madden of Madden and Finucane Solicitors. It said that some of the families were losing faith in the investigation because they had "heard nothing from the PSNI since a meeting in January and were entirely unaware of what progress had been made". Peter Madden also said there was a presumption that there had "still been no move by the PSNI to interview any of the soldiers involved in the shootings" and that this added to a perception that police were "reluctant to arrest and question soldiers as murder suspects". The letter continued: "Regrettably, as we fast approach the fifth anniversary of the delivery of Lord Saville's report, it seems that little has occurred in the interim to alleviate those public concerns and those that we represent are rapidly losing faith in the PSNI's ability to see their task through." Peter Madden demanded another meeting between the police and the families he represents. He also asked Detective Chief Inspector Ian Harrison to set out a full written progress report within the next 14 days. Mickey McKinney, whose brother William was killed on Bloody Sunday, told BBC Radio Foyle: "The entire investigation has slowed down. "The last meeting with the police was five months ago and we have been told nothing since then. "There was an agreement that there would be a meeting with families every three months but that hasn't been happening. "I only found out about the 100 soldiers being contacted last night (Thursday) but we want suspects being questioned in this case. "Sometimes I and other families just feel we are on a road to nowhere. "Some of the families would like to meet the PSNI immediately. "Time is a major factor in all of this. Suspects are not getting any younger."	The PSNI has contacted more than 100 soldiers as part of the investigation into Bloody Sunday.
Samuel Ward scored a goal either side of half-time to set up the victory, before Henry Weir made sure of the result in the final quarter. Jackson went close to scoring, shooting after the Dutch had pushed their keeper outfield, but Weir deflected it in. The result follows Thursday's 1-1 draw against hosts Germany. Britain face Belgium in their final match on Sunday (10:30 BST).	Great Britain beat the Netherlands 3-0 in the Ergo Masters Four Nations Invitational in Dusseldorf as Ashley Jackson won his 100th cap.
The Executive Office said the move was made "to enable doctors to conduct a medical assessment". Mr McGuinness was due to join the first minister on the trade mission. A spokesperson said he was "fulfilling his responsibilities as deputy first minister working with his departmental political advisers". "There has been no disruption to the work of The Executive Office during this period," added the spokesperson. Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams said: "I'm sure everybody who values his work will send best wishes to Martin, Bernie and their family. "I met Martin as normal at Stormont on Monday. I have been in regular contact with him since and he is totally committed to fulfilling his duties."	Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness pulled out of a trip to China this week due to medical advice, it has been revealed.
The Belfast Policing and Community Safety Partnership's 'Drug Dealers Don't Care, Do You?' campaign ran from February to April. In that time, the PSNI also arrested 357 people and seized £44,000 in cash. Assistant Chief Constable Will Kerr said the principal drug seized was herbal cannabis. "Along with our partners, we've invested a considerable amount of time and effort into this campaign and it has delivered worthwhile outcomes," he said. "We arrested 357 suspects, charged 78 of them, reported 163 and released 55 on police bail." A spokesperson for Belfast PCSP said: "It's encouraging that the 'Drug Dealers Don't Care' campaign would appear to be having some impact in helping to tackle the scourge of drugs on our streets and in our communities. "These latest figures demonstrate that by working in partnership and coordinating our resources we can be more effective."	Almost £1.5m of illegal drugs have been seized in Northern Ireland following a media campaign against drug dealers, police have said.
Elizabeth Passmore's final report before retirement complains admissions are too often "unnecessarily complex", "unfair" or unclear. Schools which are their own admissions authorities, like academies or faith schools, are more likely to be at fault, says the report. The government said it would review the findings and take action where needed. England's School Admissions Code requires places to be offered in a fair and open way, with arrangements set out so that parents can "understand easily how places for that school will be allocated". Admission arrangements run by local authorities for community and voluntary controlled schools "are almost always clear and uncomplicated so it is easy for parents and others to understand how places will be allocated" says the report, published late last year. But "the complexity of some schools' admission arrangements continues to be a matter of concern," writes Dr Passmore. "The arrangements set by some own-admission authority schools have so many levels of priority that often it is unclear how the arrangements could actually be applied." These complex arrangements can include numerous oversubscription criteria, different sub-categories of places, more than one catchment area, feeder schools, banding tests and aptitude assessments, says the report. "The complex arrangements of some schools do not serve local children well," adds Dr Passmore. Too often, says the report, admission arrangements are hard to find on school websites or not published at all, while some faith schools ask parents to fill in supplementary forms, asking for information prohibited under the code. Dr Passmore says banding tests are proving a particular problem. Schools say they use them to ensure a comprehensive intake but the report suggests they can be used to increase numbers of higher ability pupils. "Children living near the school, but placed in a band with many similar children, may not be allocated a place," says the report. "The first hurdle in gaining a place is to take the test." These tests are also expensive, up to Â£500 per child to administer, and the report questions the effects of banding on children, its purpose and costs. Dr Passmore also said she was "surprised and concerned" by an increase in schools operating as their own admissions authorities employing lawyers when they receive objections to the criteria they use to admit children. "Schools should be able to construct lawful arguments to their arrangements without recourse to legal advice," she writes. Overall the report notes the adjudicator dealt with 218 admissions cases in 2014-15, down from 274 the previous year, but the number upheld or partially upheld rose to 159, from 99 in 2013-14. And local authorities withdrew 284 offers of school places because of fraud, up from 186 the previous year. Margaret Tulloch of the Comprehensive Futures campaign group described the report as "very disturbing" and called for a "wholesale review of school admissions". "She is right to raise concerns about own-admission authority schools failing to meet the requirement of the code and about so-called fair banding. "These problems will only increase as more schools become academies." A Department for Education spokesman said the government wanted every child to have the opportunity of going to a good local school. "The chief adjudicator's annual report helps us identify how we can continue to improve the admissions framework to ensure fair access for all children. "We will review her findings and take action where appropriate." said the spokesman.	Too many schools in England break the rules on admissions arrangements, says the outgoing chief schools adjudicator.
The secretary of state was, by all accounts, a member of the "Remain Campaign" lobbying against a US withdrawal from the Paris Agreement. So President Trump's "Climate Brexit" was a blow to him - in an ironic twist the fossil fuel company he used to head supports the accord while the government he now represents does not. It was also a blow to the State Department, and to diplomacy. How much of a personal setback is not clear because on this, as on other issues, Tillerson kept a low profile. Twenty-four hours after the decision, the only comment he'd made was an aside at a photo-opportunity. He declared that the US would continue its efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and appealed for partners to keep things "in perspective". Tillerson had previously said the US should "maintain its seat at the table" on international climate conversations, a sensible position for the nation's top diplomat and one that he reportedly maintained in White House debates on the Paris Agreement. But publicly he showed none of the passion demonstrated by his predecessor, John Kerry, who powered negotiations on the deal. It seems the president's daughter, Ivanka, took the lead in fighting the corner for the Remainers. And the role of super-engaged interlocutor apparently fell to the climate change sceptic in the administration, Environment Protection Agency head Scott Pruitt, who spoke at the Rose Garden ceremony. Mr Tillerson did not attend, whether out of resignation or as an everyday-act-of-resistance, we don't know. A State Department official said only that he was in his office and "maintained his schedule, preparing for his trip today to Australia and New Zealand". No doubt Pruitt (and his ally, White House adviser Steve Bannon) had an easier task than Tillerson, given that he was preaching to a president sympathetic to his economic and nationalist arguments. But the results are another professional blow to the secretary of state. He's already facing a proposed budget cut that looks to gut his department. And the president's son-in-law Jared Kushner, who has even less diplomatic experience than he does, has forged a parallel foreign policy track from the White House. Clearly, the Paris withdrawal was also bad news for the State Department, which has yet to issue a statement. Where it once straddled the front lines of global climate negotiations, it's now been dropped off the map. The US does remain a member of the UN framework for climate change issues, the UNFCCC, but those meetings have become mostly about the Paris Agreement. Finally, it's a rejection of a monumental diplomatic effort by more than 190 countries over many years to strike all the balances that needed to be struck. "We have now slapped every country in the world in the face," says Todd Stern, the US Special Envoy for Climate Change in the Obama administration. "We've said we know this matters to you a lot, we know this is a huge potentially epic issue for the world, we know that some of you are particularly vulnerable, but we drop out. It's the worst way you could treat other countries." To be fair, this is not entirely untravelled ground - remember George W Bush's decision against ratifying the 1997 Kyoto climate change treaty. But it is more starkly isolationist, and this is a different Washington - in private chats, international diplomats from across the global spectrum complain that normal channels for getting and giving information at the State Department and White House are still unstaffed. They struggle to find the people who can listen to their concerns or tell them what's going on. So while this will not break alliances, it could be more difficult to pick up the pieces and say we can still be friends.

The march from Camberwell, south London, to Downing Street has been called to raise awareness of vulnerable people who used the service. The charity was closed following a row over funding. Kids Company has denied allegations of financial mismanagement. The prime minister said the government had been right to give the charity one more chance. Before it shut its doors on Wednesday, Kids Company provided practical, emotional and educational support to some of the most deprived and vulnerable inner-city children and young people in London, Liverpool and Bristol. It was founded in 1996 by Camila Batmanghelidjh. David Cameron said he was sad at the closure of the charity, which had been given a Â£3m government grant last week. He said: "The government thought it was the right thing to do to give this charity one last chance of restructuring to try and make sure it could continue its excellent work. "Sadly that didn't happen, not least because of the allegations that were made and private donors withdrawing their money but I think the government was right to say let's have one last go trying to keep this charity going, given the work it's done for so many young people." Some 150 people gathered outside the charity's former centre in Camberwell to take part in the march to Parliament. Lisa Moodie, who has been a youth worker with the charity for seven years, said: "Today isn't about Camila, it's about love, it's about making sure the children's voices are heard. "I agree people need to be accountable for what happens to our young people, it's not acceptable that we just leave them discarded. These are very vulnerable young people, they live chaotic lifestyles. "When they mess up, we're here for them just as your parents would be. It's very difficult to measure success in a hospital - it would be how many broken bones do you have. How we measure success can be in small things. It might be learning how to use a knife and fork." Anita Ebirim, who brought her eight-year-old daughter to the charity, said: "Why did they close Kids Company? It's a place we come to save our lives. "Every day we come here to eat our lunch... we get breakfast, we get clothes.  A lot of young men come who don't work, but it stops them messing around and getting into drugs." Kids Company employs 600 paid staff, as well as working with a pool of about 8,000 volunteers and 500 students. Marie, a 30-year-old volunteer from Wimbledon, said: "It makes no sense, it hasn't really sunk in yet. The kids keep coming and find out by the notice on the gates . We didn't have time to say our goodbyes to the kids." The charity has been beset by problems, including allegations of financial mismanagement and accusations by former staff that the charity failed to deal with allegations of serious incidents. Kids Company is also being investigated by the Met Police's Sexual Offences, Exploitation and Child Abuse Command. Ms Batmanghelidjh has strongly denied any wrongdoing.	Supporters of the closed charity Kids Company are taking part in a march in London.
Labour MP for Bassetlaw, John Mann, a Leave campaigner, said people voted to leave because of immigration, zero-hour contracts and job prospects and said a "divide in Britain" had been exposed. Mansfield voted most strongly to leave, with 70.9% backing Brexit. Rushcliffe, which includes the towns of West Bridgford and Bingham, was the only area to vote for Remain. It saw the East Midland's highest turnout. Meanwhile, the turnout in Nottingham was the fifth lowest in the UK at 61.8%. Leave won by a tiny margin of just over 2,000 votes in the city. Mr Mann said his party was "somewhat out of touch". "With the middle classes largely voting remain because they see it as benefiting them and the working classes largely voting to leave because it dis-benefits them - that's the divide in Britain," he said. Latest reaction and updates from Nottinghamshire Like large parts of England, Nottinghamshire overwhelmingly voted to leave the European Union. The margin of victory in Bassetlaw, Ashfield and Mansfield was huge, with less than a third of people voting remain. Arguably the biggest surprise came in Nottingham, which narrowly backed Brexit. Affluent Rushcliffe was the only area to vote Remain. Overall Nottinghamshire voted 57.9% for Leave and 42.1% for Remain. Conservative Anna Soubry, the MP for Broxtowe and a Remain campaigner, tweeted it was "a dreadful decision". "People like me were told you're scaremongering, we don't want to listen to the experts," she said. "All that has been unfortunately proved to be accurate. We have made a very, very, very bad mistake." Labour MP for Nottingham North, Graham Allen, said David Cameron had "gambled with Britain's future" by calling for a referendum, saying people voted to leave "in protest" at the current government. Turnout was 81.5% in Rushcliffe - the highest in the East Midlands and the only council area to vote Remain. The vote was close elsewhere, including in Nottingham, where the split was 50.8% Leave, 49.2% Remain. Alice, a caller to BBC Radio Nottingham from the Carrington area of the city, said she felt "frightened of the future". "It potentially gives a mandate for a lot of prejudice against people who have immigrated here, whether from the EU or elsewhere," she said.	All but one council area of Nottinghamshire, including Nottingham city, has voted to leave the EU.
Mr Abe described the 90-minute meeting in Trump Tower, New York, as "candid", with a "warm atmosphere". Some of Mr Trump's campaign rhetoric cast doubt over long-standing US alliances, including with Japan. The meeting was Mr Trump's first face-to-face with a world leader since winning the presidential election. The US and Japan have been key allies since the end of World War Two, when the US helped Japan rebuild its economy. The president-elect has vowed to scrap the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, which Mr Abe strenuously supports as a means of countering China's growing economic strength. The deal was approved by the Japanese parliament, despite the likelihood that it would be cancelled when Mr Trump takes office. Mr Trump has also said Japan needs to pay more to maintain US troops on its soil, and has floated the idea that Japan and South Korea should develop their own nuclear weapons to counter the threat from North Korean missiles. The meeting was reportedly arranged when Mr Abe rang the president-elect to congratulate him, mentioning that he would be passing through New York on the way to an Asia-Pacific trade summit in Peru. Speaking after the meeting, Mr Abe said: "We were able to have a very candid talk over a substantial amount of time. We held it in a very warm atmosphere. "I do believe that without confidence between the two nations the alliance would never function in the future and as the outcome of today's discussion I am convinced Mr Trump is a leader in whom I can have great confidence." The Japanese leader gave few details of the meeting but added the two agreed to meet again for deeper talks on a wider range of issues. Donald Trump's daughter Ivanka and her husband Jared Kushner, who have emerged as key advisers to Mr Trump since his surprise election victory, also met Mr Abe at Trump Tower. Media speculation over her role has included the possibility of her becoming ambassador to Japan. In the days since the election, Mr Trump has been speaking to dozens of world leaders as well as possible cabinet appointees from his home and office inside the Manhattan skyscraper. In other developments: Elsewhere, vice president-elect and Trump transition lead Mike Pence has said he is confident Donald Trump's administration can work with Democrats. Emerging from meetings with Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, Mr Pence said he looks "forward to finding ways that we can find common ground and move the country forward". Meanwhile, US President Barack Obama has urged his successor to stand up to Russia if it deviates from US "values and international norms". Speaking after talks with the German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin, Mr Obama said he hoped Mr Trump would "not simply take a realpolitik approach" to dealing with Russia.	Japan's PM Shinzo Abe has said he has "great confidence" in US President-elect Donald Trump and he believes they can build a relationship of trust.
Sports Minister Carál Nί Chuilίn said they stood down just before she was due to meet board representatives. They were there to discuss a report by the Head of Internal Audit at the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure and the Department of Education. Ms Nί Chuilίn said she advised the remaining members at the meeting "of my deep concerns at the issues raised by their staff" with the internal auditor. On Friday, the minister called for the meeting to consider the findings of the report into "serious allegations" about the "leadership, management and the overall culture" of the organisation. After Monday's meeting, she said she had accepted the board members' resignations, and thanked them "for their efforts in promoting and fostering sport during their time in office". In a statement, she said: "Given the ongoing challenges in Sport NI, I am taking steps to intervene directly to support both staff and the remaining board members. "I also wish to advise staff that their concerns are being taken seriously and that they will be fully addressed." Chair of the culture committee Nelson McCausland said the situation was "shocking and unprecedented". "That is why we need to get Carál Nί Chuilίn in front of the committee as soon as possible," he said. "It tells  us something about the department and the way that the minister has been running the department," Mr McCausland told BBC NI's Good Morning Ulster. "We also want to talk to the people who resigned, they have a story as well. "It is a whole quagmire, we need to get to the bottom of it. The minister owes that to the public, to Sport NI and to the  committee." Ms Nί Chuilίn said she would meet the remaining board members later this week. No-one from Sport NI was available for comment.	Nine members of the Sport NI board have resigned with immediate effect.
Shaw will be joined on the 18 July flight to Los Angeles by fellow England World Cup squad member Wayne Rooney. Spain's Juan Mata and David De Gea are also named, plus Japan's Shinji Kagawa. "We are delighted to have such a strong travelling squad for our pre-season tour to the United States," said assistant manager Ryan Giggs. United have already confirmed new manager Louis van Gaal will be present, even though he could be involved in the World Cup final with Netherlands, only five days before his squad leave Manchester. Van Gaal's side have a minimum of four games in the US, starting against Los Angeles Galaxy on 23 July and including an International Champions Cup programme against Roma, Nemanja Vidic's new club Inter Milan and Real Madrid.	Manchester United's £56m new signings Ander Herrera and Luke Shaw will join the squad to tour the United States later this month.
Vaughan Gething said he was "looking again at charging arrangements" for people from countries without reciprocal arrangements with the UK. In a new BBC Wales poll, 79% of those surveyed said they would increase charges for visitors from outside the UK for using the health service. But Mr Gething said such charges were a "marginal area" of NHS activity. Speaking to The Wales Report on Wednesday, he said: "We have reciprocal arrangements with most European countries, and as long as those reciprocal arrangements work I see no reason to intervene and change those. "However for people outside the UK and Europe where we don't have those, we're looking again at charging arrangements." "Later in the year I'll get to make a decision on what charging may or may not look like." But the health secretary added: "This is such a marginal area of activity." "Really, when you're talking about the central funding of the health service, with the big challenge that we face, the actual conversation about charging people from abroad is an absolute distraction." Asked whether he would consider charging patients who have illnesses caused by their lifestyle choices, Mr Gething said: "If you're really saying, for example, that someone with lung cancer who smoked should therefore be charged for their treatment. "I actually think that when you get into real examples like that, people will very quickly say that isn't what I think should happen. "When you think about the practical reality of it, it isn't that simple at all." Mr Gething warned while the Welsh Government had made "significant additional commitments" to the health service from its budget, there would be difficult consequences if austerity continues across the UK. "The challenge will be if we don't see the tide turned back on austerity every single part of the UK health service system will face really awful choices, that I don't think the public will tolerate."	The Welsh Government is reviewing NHS charges for visitors from outside the UK, the health secretary has said.
It shows Californians are starting to understand "that we are in the drought of our lives," state water regulator official Felicia Marcus said. It is the second month in a row the state has exceeded emergency conservation regulation. California has been dealing with record low water levels for four years. California Governor Jerry Brown imposed the state's first mandatory water restrictions four months ago, ordering a 25% reduction in all towns and cities. In June, the state used 27% less water than it used in the same period of 2013, when the drought emergency was first declared. This saving rose to 31.3% in July, with a cumulative saving for both months of 29.5%, the State Water Resources Control Board reported on Thursday. Felicia Marcus, who chairs the board, praised the "millions of conscientious Californians" who she described as "the real heroes here". She said record rain in July had played a role, as well as better enforcement, including warnings and penalties, and messaging by the water agencies. But, she warned, "this isn't your mother's drought or your grandmother's drought, this is the drought of the century". Drought monitors say 92% of California is currently in severe drought or worse, down from 94% at the start of the year.	Cities in California cut water use by 31.3% in July, exceeding a state-wide mandate of 25% to combat a record four-year drought there, officials say.
When we arrived at the engineer's home, the dilapidated machine was an eyesore at the bottom of his garden. "Nobody pays, nobody pays," the wealthy German-Afghan businessman told us. He offered us tea and biscuits and explained how, a few years ago, all his large hospital and road building projects were suddenly given to politicians' cronies. To add to the misfortune, around that time a roadside bomb in this war-torn country killed 15 of his workers. Later we visited a part of his armoury of German-made trucks, trailers, loaders and diggers that sat at the top of a hill, consigned, like his ambitions, to the scrapheap of history. Mr Popal told us, perhaps unsurprisingly, that he would leave Afghanistan soon unless things changed. The World Bank has said that it's harder to do business in Afghanistan than Iran, Iraq, Syria and Zimbabwe. Yet Afghanistan's new president says he wants the country "truly open for business". As a former World Bank executive himself, President Ashraf Ghani is all too familiar with the scale of the challenge. He inherited an economy in tatters after three decades of war, despite more than $100bn (??64bn) of mainly US money spent on reconstruction, which was more than the US paid to rebuild Europe after the Second World War. There's massive corruption, a lack of credit, contracts are difficult to enforce and electricity is scarce. The speed with which President Ghani dealt with the $1bn Kabul Bank scandal, one of the world's largest bank frauds, demonstrated a new political will. But the president recently missed his own deadline to form a cabinet, suggesting that deeper reforms are likely to take some time to achieve, such as simplifying Afghanistan's business environment, which has been plagued by needless red tape. Keen entrepreneurs have had to be creative to thrive. Helped by British aid money, pharmacy owner Zabi Ullah opened the country's first counterfeit-free, 24-hour chain of chemists, where customers can check if goods are real using a text message service. Old rules made it illegal to open more than one store under the same name and within 200m of each other. But Mr Ullah registered each shop under a different family member's name. It was far from ideal but was workable, based on trust. Speaking in one of his pharmacies in the capital Kabul, Mr Ullah says: "The family has been co-operative that they give me their names. They will be co-operating with me when the regulation changes and all the ownership of the licences will transfer back to [my] pharmacies." Working within antiquated rules cost the country dearly. Naseem Akbar is chief executive of the non-profit, Afghan-business focused organisation Harakat. His job is to reduce regulation in Afghanistan. He believes politicians are to blame for the weak economic growth over the past decade. He says good policies were created but never implemented, which stifled private sector development. Mr Akbar welcomes Mr Ghani's new anti-corruption approach, which he describes as "a shock to the system". He says the government must define a clear economic development strategy to bolster the investment climate in the country. Mr Akbar also wants a single organisation to run all public services to deter corruption. "Part of [what's behind] the insurgency is the disappointment that the public service offers for its people," he says. President Ghani needs to rebuild Afghanistan's financial reputation ahead of a crucial donor conference in London next month. On a recent fundraising trip to China, the president accepted Afghanistan needed foreign funds for nation building but insisted he has not asked the international community for charity. "We truly need to learn to fish, not to be given fish," he said.	The only thing Asadullah Popal's digger had gathered was dust.
Iran international Ghoochannejhad, 28, scored five goals in 42 appearances after joining the Addicks in 2014. Former Juventus defender Motta, 30, featured 12 times following his move to The Valley in February. Marko Dmitrovic, Alou Diarra and Callum Harriott have triggered one-year extensions to their current deals. Meanwhile, the south-east London club have offered a new contract to 20-year-old goalkeeper Dillon Phillips. Development squad players Zak Ansah, Alex Kelly, Ayo Obileye, Josh Staunton and Joe Pigott will also leave Charlton, who finished 22nd in the Championship this season and dropped back into League One following four years in the second tier. Jose Riga left his position of head coach following the final game of the season and the Addicks are yet to appoint a new boss. Northampton's Chris Wilder was approached to succeed the Belgian but turned the job down and joined Sheffield United instead.	Forward Reza Ghoochannejhad and full-back Marco Motta will leave relegated Charlton Athletic when their contracts expire this summer.
The girl, called Nieve, was attending the Handmade Parade in Hebden Bridge on Sunday with her grandparents when the dog jumped up and bit her. She needed eyelid surgery and suffered "potentially irreparable damage" to a tear duct. The man in the e-fit is described as being broad, bald and aged about 50. A second man, also thought to be about 50 and of similar build, was present at the time of the incident, West Yorkshire Police said. Both men left the scene without checking on the girl's welfare or leaving any details. The dog, believed to be a Staffordshire bull terrier, was on a lead at the time of the incident and is described as brindle and white coloured. PCSO Gareth Helliwell said: "The five-year-old girl involved in this incident needed reconstructive surgery to an eyelid following this attack and has suffered potentially irreparable damage to her lower tear duct." The girl's family described the dog's owner as "scum", adding "she could have lost her eye, she was covered in blood and the guy just ran off, it's cowardly". She was also bitten on the ankle despite the dog being pulled away on a lead, they said. Police appealed for anyone with information about the dog or the two men with it to contact them.	Police have issued an e-fit of a man they want to trace in connection with a dog attack on a five-year-old girl.
Councils in England, including Bradford and Birmingham, will trial the pilot scheme at local elections in 2018. The government said it would "ensure the integrity" of the electoral system. But campaigners said levels of fraud did not justify the move and one Labour MP said it would hit poorer voters. A full list of the participating councils has not yet been drawn up, but 18 council areas in England identified by the Electoral Commission as being most susceptible to voter fraud will be invited to take part in the pilot. The 18 also include Luton, Slough, Woking, Coventry and Bristol. Different local authorities will trial different types of ID, including driving licences, passports and utility bills. The creation of a new form of ID specifically for voting has been ruled out by ministers. Northern Ireland already requires voters to show ID before casting their vote. Constitution minister Chris Skidmore said fraud of any kind was unacceptable and dismissed suggestions that the plans, which could be rolled out across the whole country if successful, could disenfranchise poor people who do not have ID. He told BBC Radio Four's Today programme: "Voting is one of the most important transactions you can make as an individual. In many transactions you need a proof of ID." "I'm determined to ensure, when it comes to groups who are under-registered, that they get the opportunity to exercise their vote," he added. "Ensuring those communities are protected, that the risks of electoral fraud are diminished, will ensure those individuals are represented fairly across this country." The reform was first touted by former cabinet minister Sir Eric Pickles in August, when he released recommendations amid growing concerns about electoral fraud. He tweeted that the government was "right to give greater powers to electoral officials and the police to deal with intimidation and other unwanted behaviour". In his report, Sir Eric cited research suggesting certain Pakistani and Bangladeshi communities could be more vulnerable to fraud due to a lack of understanding of the voting process. He highlighted "kinship" traditions, saying they emphasised collective over individual rights and made it more likely that people would "hand over" their vote over to others. Mr Skidmore dismissed suggestions the new measures were targeted at any "particular community" but said it was essential people across the UK were able to fulfil their democratic rights "regardless of their race or their religion". The Electoral Reform Society, which campaigns for changes to the electoral system to make it "fairer", said the move was a "blunt instrument" that could deter people from voting. "While we should take all instances of voter fraud very seriously where they occur, mandatory voter ID is a sledgehammer to crack a nut," chief executive Katie Ghose said. "The government should think very carefully before introducing barriers to voting. "There is simply no evidence to suggest that electoral fraud is widespread across the UK. Where it has occurred it has been isolated and should be tackled locally." Labour said it supported the idea in principle but views varied among its MPs with Stella Creasy, MP for Walthamstow, suggesting it was a "retrograde step" that was "more about combating low income voting" than tackling fraud. Jim Fitzpatrick, MP for Poplar and Limehouse, said he didn't have an issue with the idea as "most people carry ID". Former London mayor Ken Livingstone, who was suspended from the Labour Party and is currently an independent, said it was a "political" move and would make life more difficult for most people because of a handful of crimes. "The real problem is the people most likely not to have a passport or a driving licence are going to be the poorest and that I suspect will basically hit the Labour Party," he told Today. As well as the trials, election officials and police will be given new powers to tackle intimidation of voters by activists, who will also be banned from collecting postal votes for submission - a practice known as "harvesting". The government said it was considering plans to check the nationality of voters to stop fraudulent registrations. There will also be reforms to improve the security of the postal ballot system, including requiring postal voters to re-apply every three years.	Plans to demand proof of identity before voting in a bid to combat electoral fraud have been defended by ministers, amid criticism the move is a "sledgehammer to crack a nut".
A former field marshal, three generals and six admirals say the loss of Ark Royal and its fleet of Harrier jets has damaged Britain's defence capabilities. They say Britain can no longer mount amphibious operations without putting troops' lives at "considerable risk". Defence Secretary Liam Fox has defended the "difficult decisions". The BBC's defence correspondent, Jonathan Beale, said the letter, which was leaked to the Daily Telegraph, raises questions about what military rescue operation forces could mount in the future. In December, Dr Fox announced that the frigate sent to evacuate British nationals from Libya - HMS Cumberland - is to be decommissioned in April, following the strategic defence and security review (SDSR). Our correspondent says this is not the first time former military top brass have warned that recent cuts in the armed forces have left Britain dangerously exposed. Labour has already called for the defence review to be reopened in light of events in Egypt, Bahrain and Libya. The letter - written before the current evacuation operation in Libya - is signed by, among others, Field Marshal Lord Bramall, a former chief of the defence staff; Maj Gen Julian Thompson and Adm Sir Jeremy Black, who commanded the carrier Invincible during the Falklands conflict. Dr Fox insists Britain still has the "right military assets" in place to respond to crises. But this group of former military commanders is calling on the prime minister to reassess the decisions made in the defence review. They have called for a re-evaluation of the SDSR, which they say is "unduly trusting in an uncertain, fast-moving and dangerous world". However Dr Fox defended the steps taken to tackle the Â£38bn deficit left by Labour and said the review would not be reopened. "For our future carrier strike capability, it makes strategic sense to move towards greater inter-operability with the US and France and installing catapult and arrestor gear will deliver this. "Sustaining both Tornado and Harrier would be prohibitively expensive in this current economic climate and Tornado continues to provide vital support to the front line in Afghanistan," he said. Referring to Libya, he said Hercules C-130 aircraft had lifted 51 UK citizens to safety on Thursday - and more than 100 were on their way to Malta on HMS Cumberland. "None of our allies have seen fit to position an aircraft carrier off the coast of Libya as this is not the tool required for this task; there is no requirement for ground attack aircraft, but even if there were we would use our extensive regional basing and overflight rights," he said. But shadow defence secretary Jim Murphy said: "The government's plans were based on strategic and international geo-political assumptions, many of which have been shaken over the past month. "Recent dramatic events mean that the defence review must be reopened and perhaps even rethought. It would be sensible to stop and reflect again on our nation's strategic defence needs."	Ten retired senior military officers have written to the prime minister to voice their concerns over the loss of the aircraft carrier HMS Ark Royal.
Media playback is not supported on this device Former heavyweight world champion Haye, 36, made a series of graphic descriptions of hurting Bellew, with the BBBofC warning both fighters. Bellew, 34, stopped Haye in round 11, with the Londoner subsequently having surgery on a ruptured Achilles tendon. "Some of the comments went too far," Haye told BBC Sport. It is expected that any sanctions against Haye will be announced after a BBBofC meeting on Wednesday. "If I have to pay a fine, I'll happily pay and take whatever punishment I need to," he said. Haye added he now has a "different kind of respect" for WBC cruiserweight champion Bellew and would not repeat such comments before a rematch, which he reiterated his desire to pursue. "When you get into that beast mode before the fight, you're not thinking about political correctness, you're not thinking about fines, you're just thinking about getting in the ring," he said. "When you're in that beast mode you say things which rub the average person up the wrong way." Haye suffered an Achilles injury in the sixth round at the O2 Arena, with Bellew capitalising to score a knockdown. A second knockdown in the 11th round saw Haye's corner throw in the towel, which the fighter now believes could have kept him from doing "irreparable damage" to his ankle and foot. "It was a strange situation - I was getting into my flow and it felt like I stepped on a bear trap," he said. "I saw Tony look down and think 'I've got you here,' so it just became about survival - trying not to get knocked out while trying to knock him out on one leg, which is pretty tough. "I knew it was completely ruptured - the pain was terrible, when I put my foot down I could hear it crunching, but the adrenaline is so high when you're fighting you can conjure up the energy from somewhere to keep going. "I believed if I landed that one shot I could change the outcome of the fight but I was fighting a current world champion - I gave it my best shot but came up short." Bellew said he is considering retirement following his win, but admitted an offer for one further fight could be too lucrative to turn down. Haye admits a rematch "solely depends on Tony" but sees a second bout as the first step as he seeks to regain a world heavyweight title belt. "I still believe it, more now than ever, that if I'm fit and healthy, I can beat anybody," he said. "Maybe [Tony] is happy with the victory over me and if that's the case, I wish him nothing but luck. If he wants to do it again, then great. "Very few people on the planet believe I'm the best so I need to win that fight again, bare minimum, and then people can maybe look at me for world title fights. "For me, focus on the leg, and I will become the world heavyweight champion."	David Haye expects a fine from the British Boxing Board of Control for his comments in the build-up to Saturday's defeat by Tony Bellew.
It says the overnight operation took place in Nowzad district in Helmand province. Two insurgents were killed and many were detained in the raid. It came amid the Taliban's annual spring offensive, which has seen heavy fighting in Helmand. In December a similar operation led to the release of 40 people. The latest mission was carried out under the cover of darkness by the Ktah Khas, Afghanistan's counter-terrorism unit and commando forces, the statement said. Nato said its troops had "supported their Afghan partners in a train, advise and assist role". The statement gave no details about the liberated prisoners, who are said to have been taken to Kandahar to be debriefed. The Afghan forces did not sustain any casualties in the raid, Nato added. Correspondents say the operation is rare success for Afghan forces who have been put on the back foot by Taliban advances in Helmand. The Taliban have made gains since international troops withdrew from an active fighting role in 2014. Nato forces are increasingly being deployed in battle zones to support Afghan forces fighting the Taliban. Last year, the number of people killed and wounded in the conflict rose to the highest level yet recorded, the UN recently said.	Afghan special forces have freed more than 60 people held by the Taliban in a makeshift jail in the south of the country, Nato says.
The rock is an eroded volcano that lies 260 miles (418km) west of the Western Isles and is only 30m (100ft) wide and 21m (70ft) high above the sea. The Nato documents report how the UK claimed Rockall in 1955. The government feared that it could be used by "hostile agents" as a place to monitor the Hebrides Rocket Range. A small team of military personnel was taken to Rockall by the Royal Navy in September 1955 to claim as UK territory. A Union Flag was raised and a plaque installed on the rock. In the documents, it says: "This decision of the UK government was connected with the fact that the UK government had recently decided to set up a guided missile range in South Uist, in the Outer Hebrides. "The island of Rockall was uninhabited but this government wished to guard against the possibility of hostile agents installing themselves on the island in order to observe the effects of the tests on the South Uist range." People have stayed on Rockall, though only temporarily, in the past, including in 1997 when three campaigners from Greenpeace managed to climb on to the rock. They lived on Rockall for 42 days and renamed it Waveland in protest at exploration of new oil and gas reserves in the surrounding seabed. In 2014, a Scots adventurer broke the record for occupying the remote North Atlantic rock. Adventurer Nick Hancock survived on there for 43 days, beating the previous record held by three Greenpeace campaigners who lived there for 42 days. The time also beat the previous solo record of 40 days set by Tom McClean in 1985. Mr Hancock celebrated achieving the solo record by popping a small bottle of champagne while also sending a tweet with a message to veteran adventurer Mr McClean, of Morar in the west Highlands. His message was simply: "Sorry Tom."	Declassified documents reveal concerns of the UK government 60 years ago that Rockall could become a base for spying on a missile test site.
The space agency has set out a three part plan, which it hopes will eventually lead to humans living on Mars by the 2030s. Unlike the Moon, humans have never physically set foot on Mars, we've only ever used robots like the Curiosity Rover. By exploring Mars with robots for the last 40 years Nasa has found out lots about our neighbouring planet, including the recent discovery that there is flowing icy water under the crust. They hope that this huge mission will help us to learn even more about not just Mars, but Earth as well. So, how will they do it? Since 2010 Nasa has been testing out the effects of what living in space can do to the human body, to prepare them for the journey to Mars, and also for living there. They have done this by sending astronauts to live onboard the International Space Station for long periods of time. Nasa also sent a team of scientists to live in a "Mars-like" dome for a year near a volcano on Earth, to see if the team can live happily on their own, away from everyday human-life. They are also doing a number of tests on Mars spacesuits and are currently trying out technology which could be used on the planet. In the "Proving Ground" part of their plan, Nasa hope to be able to do experiments in a "deep space" environment which will allow scientists and astronauts to return to Earth in a matter of days. Most of these experiments will take place in the Moon's orbit. Some of their plans include teaming up with the European Space Agency as part of their Asteroid Redirect Robotic Mission in 2020, which aims to take a large asteroid from a near-Earth orbit, and move it to travel around the Moon instead. Astronauts aboard the Orion spacecraft will then explore the asteroid in the 2020s, and return to Earth with samples. NASA will also be testing out its powerful new systems such as the Space Launch System rocket and Solar Electric Propulsion, which would be used for sending supplies to the team, and also for long space travel. Nasa will build a new rover robot to join the Curiosity rover in 2020. It will have lots of new gadgets to test out on Mars. One of these gadgets is called MOXIE, and will be trying to make oxygen, which is an important part of the air we breathe here on Earth, from carbon dioxide, which is in the atmosphere on Mars, Researchers will also be investigating ways astronauts can recycle better in space. In the "Earth Independent" phase of Nasa's plan, they hope to be able to send humans to Mars, using all the research and new technology they discovered in the previous phases. At the moment it takes around eight months to travel to Mars, but scientists are looking into ways to reduce this time. By 2030 Nasa are hoping they will be able to send people to the edges and surface of Mars, not just to visit, but also to live there for a long period of time. They will be looking into ways to make fuel, water, oxygen and building materials on the Red planet. Nasa will also be looking into improving their communications systems with Earth, to allow for quicker exchanges of research and data For years scientists have been curious about the Red planet, and whether or not humans would be able to live there. Recent research has proved that there is water on the planet, and that at one point Mars' climate was perhaps similar to that on Earth. Robot rovers are also looking for the possibility of whether there is alien life there too. Sending humans to the planet could help speed up the research and allow us to better understand the history of Mars. Nasa are also curious to find out if studying Mars could help us find out more about our own planet, and even how our solar system was born. However Nasa could be pipped to the post in the race to Mars, as a non-profit organization based in the Netherlands has said they will land humans on Mars by 2027.	Nasa has revealed its plans to try to get humans living on Mars in the next few decades.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko had earlier called for a "Day of Silence", to make a widely-violated ceasefire deal stick. New talks between the rebels and the government could take place in Belarus in the coming days. Russia has resumed gas supplies to Ukraine after months of tough talks. Ukrainian pipeline operator Ukrtransgaz says up to 43.5m cubic metres (1.5bn cu ft) will be imported daily, to prevent winter shortages. Ukraine has paid Russia's Gazprom $378m (Â£242m; â‚¬308m) in advance for December deliveries, officials say. Russia cut off Ukraine's gas in June as the conflict between the government in Kiev and the rebels in the east escalated. But a new gas deal was reached through EU mediation in October. Ukraine and its Western allies accuse Russia of supplying heavy weapons and troops to the rebels - something Moscow has repeatedly denied. The warring sides signed a truce in Minsk in September, but more than 1,000 people have been killed in fighting since then, the UN says. Some of the heaviest fighting has raged at Donetsk airport. The Ukrainian military said on Tuesday a ceasefire had begun in "all the positions of the anti-terrorist operation forces", Interfax Ukraine news agency reported. The pro-Russian separatists had also laid down their arms at 09:00 (07:00 GMT) across eastern Ukraine, Russia's Ria Novosti agency said. Mr Poroshenko said last week that troops would observe the Day of Silence on Tuesday to try to boost the peace deal. Since the conflict began in April, more than 4,300 people have died with almost one million displaced, the UN says. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov says Kiev must not renege on a pledge to give "special status" to the rebel-held Donetsk and Luhansk areas in the east. Speaking to Russia's RIA Novosti news agency, he said Mr Poroshenko had called for that status to be cancelled - a move that would "only strengthen the distrust between the sides, complicating their already difficult dialogue". He also accused Kiev of blocking financial co-operation with the rebel-held areas. Authorities in Minsk said they had not received any confirmation that either the Ukrainian government or rebel representatives would attend new peace talks, which were planned to begin on Tuesday. Russian media reports say that the talks may now begin on Friday instead, but this has not been confirmed. The previous Minsk agreement, brokered in September, projected a 30km (18 mile) military buffer zone in the east and limited self-rule for the separatists. However, the rebels then held leadership elections on 2 November that Ukraine and the West refused to recognise. There have been near-daily clashes and exchanges of heavy weapons fire, leaving hundreds dead. Meanwhile, the last pieces of wreckage from Malaysia Airlines flight MH17, which was shot down over eastern Ukraine, have arrived in the Netherlands for investigation. Ukraine and its allies have accused Russia of supplying the missile used to bring down the plane, while Russia has denied involvement. A total of 298 people died when the plane came down in July. The Ukraine crisis began a year ago, when then-President Viktor Yanukovych abandoned an agreement on closer trade ties with EU in favour of closer co-operation with Russia. This decision sparked pro-EU protests in the capital Kiev, eventually toppling Mr Yanukovych in February. In the weeks that followed, Russia annexed Crimea, in Ukraine's south, and pro-Russian separatists took control of Donetsk and Luhansk, declaring independence. The crisis has caused a serious rift between Russia and Ukraine's Western supporters.	Ukrainian government forces and pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine are observing a ceasefire after weeks of bitter fighting, officials say.
They said this will amount to double the number of apprentices created each year - currently about 28,000. All parties are promising to create more apprentices or equivalent schemes to get unemployment down. Labour highlighted its pledge to create 100,000 additional apprentices. The Lib Dems said they would fund their promise by moving cash from Jobs Growth Wales, the Labour Welsh Government's existing job-creation scheme. Eluned Parrott, the Liberal Democrats' candidate for Cardiff Central, said: "Providing high-quality skills training is vital to boosting our economy and helping people to build careers and get on in life. "Labour's own evaluation report said that Jobs Growth Wales locked people into low wages and that 73% would've found work without it. "We all know this scheme is a failure, but Labour refuses to face the facts. "The Welsh Liberal Democrats would instead invest in apprenticeships and training, which will actually give young people professional skills and help them get on in life." On Labour's policy, Deputy Skills Minister Julie James said Wales already had "one of the best records in Europe" on apprenticeships. "This pledge is the next step to ensuring that we have the skills base that projects like Wylfa Newydd and the South Wales Metro, will demand," she said. "That is why so many voices within industry are so enthusiastic about this pledge." Plaid Cymru has promised to created 50,000 new apprentices, while the Welsh Conservatives say they will lift the current 16-24 age restrictions on the Jobs Growth Wales scheme. It helps firms employ 16-24-year-olds for six months by covering the cost of the minimum wage. The Tories aim to replace it with a scheme called Journeys to Work, open to all ages, with jobs lasting for a year. UKIP say they back industry-supported apprenticeships, along with more vocational options in post-14 education.	The Welsh Liberal Democrats would create 140,000 extra apprentices over the next five years if the party wins power in May's elections.
The 34-year-old's ban now expires on 1 June 2018, instead of 25 October 2018. He was banned in April after being charged with breaking FA rules for placing 1,260 bets on matches between 26 March 2006 and 13 May 2016. Barton, who says he is addicted to gambling, appealed against the length of the ban which he called "excessive". The FA's Appeal Board said the initial ban was "excessive in the circumstances" as evidence from Barton's consultant psychiatrist about his addiction should not have been rejected. The report says the new ban "reflects the overall seriousness of the breaches and also the mitigation including the full extent of Mr Barton's addiction". Barton, whose fine of £30,000 remained unchanged, was released from Burnley in May. Players in England's top eight tiers are banned from betting on football. Former Manchester City and Newcastle midfielder Barton rejoined Burnley in January, having left Scottish Premiership side Rangers in November. In November 2016, he was given a one-match ban for breaking Scottish Football Association rules on gambling. Barton admitted the Scottish FA charge of placing 44 bets between 1 July and 15 September 2016, while he was a player at Ibrox.	Former Burnley midfielder Joey Barton's suspension from football for breaching betting rules has been reduced by almost five months after an appeal.
He was seriously injured in a bomb attack in Afghanistan in 2006. Since carrying the torch on 26 June, Doncaster-based L/Bdr Parkinson has had thousands of requests on Facebook. But the site limits friend associations to 5,000 per personal page and he cannot accept all the requests. Flanked by hundreds of people, he walked for nearly half an hour with the Olympic torch with an assistant who supported his arm. L/Bdr Parkinson's nomination stated: "The brain injury took his speech, but not his personality and sense of humour," adding he now speaks unaided. It said: "Determined to prove everyone wrong, he fought back every step of the way. Ben's intelligence and wit [are] unchanged. Still the same funny and caring Ben." He spends 12 hours a day in the gym and rehab and walks with crutches, spending "the rest of his time spent raising money for many military charities and as patron of his beloved             Pilgrim Bandits ". L/Bdr Parkinson's mother Diane said the responses had "been phenomenal" and that Ben was really "buoyed up" by the support and friendship he had been shown. She said: "It's just unbelievable, Ben's had way over 5,000 friend requests but Facebook won't let him have more than that number. "Thousands of people have joined the Pilgrim Bandits website and the messages of support we've had are great. "Ben's page has had 19,000 hits just on an update, I don't understand how these things work, but it's phenomenal." She said the amount of post the family had received had also increased. She added: "Some mail has just been addressed to Ben, please Mr Postie. "E-mail traffic has gone through the roof and Ben's had hundreds of requests to visit places with the [Olympic] torch. "He's absolutely bouncing and buoyed up and elated." Facebook would not comment on the issue but their guidance was that if people were receiving this many requests then they have become a public figure, so should consider having a page instead of a profile. Alternatively, Ben could use subscribe so that people can see his public updates without actually becoming a friend. A total of 8,000 people will carry the flame during its 8,000 mile, 70-day journey to the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in London on 27 July.	Injured paratrooper Ben Parkinson, who carried the Olympic flame, has been swamped with friend requests on social media and seen a huge increase in post addressed to "hero Ben".
Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said Mrs May, who was home secretary before becoming PM, had allowed officer numbers to fall in recent years. The Conservatives said Ms Abbott had "dangerous" views on protecting the public. Armed police numbers have increased, a Conservative spokesman added. Following the London and Manchester terror attacks, security is featuring heavily in the final days of campaigning before Thursday's general election. Labour has been targeting cuts to the Home Office's policing budget - the Conservatives have rejected the criticism and a former terrorism law watchdog said linking the cuts to terror attacks was a "completely misleading argument". Speaking to the BBC, Ms Abbott said it was "concerning" that action was not taken when one of the London attackers - 27-year-old Khuram Butt - was known to the security services. She said this reinforced the need for an increase in community police officers. Latest figures show that between September 2010 and September 2016, police workforce numbers in England and Wales fell by 18,991, or 13%. Ms Abbott said police numbers had fallen "on Theresa May's watch" despite warnings from the Police Federation and HM Inspector of Constabulary. "So she should really consider how much of this goes back to her door and the decisions that she took," she said. Asked how much of a connection there was between Saturday's attack and the cuts to officer numbers, she added: "She does need to explain why she thought it appropriate to watch police numbers go down by 20,000 when she had so many warnings from so many people that this was putting people at risk. "Clearly the people responsible for these horrific terror attacks are the bloodthirsty and depraved terrorists but Theresa May has to take responsibility for letting austerity damage her ability to keep us safe." Speaking in a special general election edition of Question Time, Lib Dem leader Tim Farron said cuts to police numbers had "not made us safer". But Lord Carlile, the former independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, told the BBC cuts in community policing were "nothing to do with terrorism", saying "nobody in the security services is complaining about their funding" Following the London attack, Mrs May said "things need to change" in the fight against terrorism, calling for more to be done about online extremism and for a review into whether security services needed extra powers. Speaking to BBC Newsbeat, she defended her record, saying she had given the police extra powers to deal with terrorists and that there had been an increase in the number of people reporting suspected extremists to the authorities. The Conservatives described Labour's criticism as "desperate stuff", saying the security services had been boosted with extra officers. "Diane Abbott's views on keeping us safe are as dangerous as she is hopeless under pressure," a spokesman said, saying she had "voted against every piece of security legislation designed to keep us safe".	Labour has accused Theresa May of "letting austerity damage her ability to keep us safe" as it continues its attack over police cuts.
Miriam Briddon died after the collision involving her Fiat Punto and a Volkswagen Golf driven by Gareth Entwhistle near Ciliau Aeron. Entwhistle, 34, from the Aeron Valley, admitted causing death by careless driving while under the influence of alcohol on 29 March, 2014. He will appear again at Swansea Crown Court at the end of July. The crash victim was a former Ysgol Dyffryn Teifi pupil, described by her family as a "creative person who would be truly missed".	A Ceredigion man has pleaded guilty to drink-driving and causing a crash which killed a 21-year-old woman.
The 32-year-old was released by the Paisley club after making more than 330 appearances over two stints. "He's played at the highest level in Scotland and is top flight quality," manager Ian Murray told the club website. "A player of his calibre opting to join us is a very good sign." A League Cup winner with the Buddies in 2013, Van Zanten, who also had spells at Hibs, Morton and Hamilton, made 18 appearances last season. Van Zanten is the Championship club's second summer signing, following Scott Taggart's move from Morton.	Former St Mirren full-back David van Zanten has joined Dumbarton on a one-year deal, with the option of staying for a further 12 months.
Otters were declared extinct on the Japanese islands by its Ministry of the Environment in August 2012. The Skye-based International Otter Survival Fund (IOSF) has been helping with the reintroduction preparations. Dr Takahiro Murakami, who will lead the Japanese visit to Scotland, has never seen otters in the wild. The Japanese otter was believed to be either a subspecies of the Eurasian otter or possibly even a separate species. Conservationists have suggested reintroducing otters to Hokkaido, an island in north Japan. IOSF supports conservation projects across the world. It also rescues and raises orphaned otter cubs.	Conservationists are to visit Skye to learn more about otter habitats ahead of a proposed reintroduction of the mammals to Japan.
Wilson rejoined Championship side Forest from Celtic for £2.5m in August 2013, but has been without a team since being released in May.

The Kremlin's dreams of a US-Russian rapprochement under President Donald Trump were shattered by the American Tomahawk cruise missiles slamming into the Syrian air base. One might add another piece of advice: "Choose your allies carefully". It is an unexpected reversal of fortune for Russia and President Vladimir Putin. Only a few days ago US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said that removing Syria's Bashar al-Assad from power was no longer Washington's priority. This was probably taken by the Syrian president as carte blanche to step up his attacks on the opposition. But the chemical attack on the town of Khan Sheikhoun - believed to be the work of his forces - backfired. Even if one sets moral considerations apart (and this was a war crime, pure and simple), Moscow's credibility among the leading players in the region is dented now. Either: Moscow knew about the planned attack and condoned it - which means its co-sponsorship with the US of the 2013 Syrian chemical weapons liquidation deal was a ruse, a deception, and it therefore cannot be trusted; Or: the Assad regime deceived Russia and kept some of its chemical weapons (or production facilities) hidden, to use them at will. Then it means that the Kremlin has zero leverage on Damascus. In the hard-power world of the Middle East one doesn't know which outcome is more damaging for Russia. Two US destroyers casually launched 59 cruise missiles, worth nearly $1m (Â£m) each, just to make a political point. That underlines the discrepancy in financial and material resources between the US and Russia. Trump sends a resolute signal on Syria Dramatic turnaround for Trump Why was Syria's Shayrat airbase bombed? Six decisive points that changed Syria's war The fact that the Americans told Moscow in advance about the strike, to avoid casualties among Russian military personnel stationed on the airbase, only added insult to injury. The message was unmistakable: "Step aside please while we do our own thing here." The Trump administration is prepared to act unilaterally in the volatile region, where many are tired of Washington's eight years of inaction and long for a US "return". Donald Trump showed that he, unlike Barack Obama, is not only prepared to draw "red lines" but is also ready to punish those who cross them. Key American allies in the Middle East - Israel, Egypt, Jordan and Turkey - roundly praised his action. In the absence of a coherent policy by the Obama White House these states visibly moved towards strengthening ties with Moscow. However, in the last few weeks President Trump, Secretary of State Tillerson and Defense Secretary James Mattis have held intensive talks with these countries to re-establish confidence in US policies. Probably the most unpleasant thing for Mr Putin is Turkey's approval of the US strikes. The Russian leader made a big personal effort to forge an alliance between Russia, Iran and Turkey, to help impose the Russian vision of future Syrian conflict resolution, which would keep the Assad regime intact. Now it looks as if Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has started playing a different game. President Trump said he took the decision to launch a strike based on humanitarian grounds, after seeing images of gassed children. Whether it is true or not, such an attitude will earn him support in Europe, where such considerations are important. That's bad news for Moscow. Mr Putin doesn't like - and doesn't know how to talk about  - "values". He prefers "interests". Although the White House said the strikes were a "one-off" action it looks as if a full-scale return of the United States to the Middle East is being considered by Mr Trump and his top advisers. It doesn't look like the White House will consult the Kremlin about the terms of this return. Moreover, it seems very likely that putting pressure on Russia's top ally Iran may be next on the cards for Washington. Domestically the Kremlin will redouble propaganda efforts by its massive state TV machine to convince the population that Russia is in the right and that the Americans are once again out to get it. Presidential elections are due in 2018 in Russia. In Mr Putin's view, nothing works as well as anti-Americanism and great power rhetoric to mobilise the electorate. For the US and Middle East the Kremlin will most likely adopt the old Soviet-style policy of mixing threats with softer language, hoping to reach an accommodation that could be presented domestically as a "victory". It did work with the Obama White House. It might not with the Trump administration. After all, no one promised that "making America great again" would mean sharing that greatness with others.

Media playback is not supported on this device The 23-year-old earned GB's second medal of the Hong Kong championships following Elinor Barker's silver medal in the women's scratch on Wednesday. Latham emerged from the pack to take bronze as he chased down Adrian Teklinski of Poland, who won gold, and Lucass Liss of Germany, who got silver. In the men's team pursuit, GB were beaten to the bronze medal by Italy. Media playback is not supported on this device "I am really happy to come away with a medal, finally," Latham told the BBC. "I wasn't sure that Teklinski was going to hold on there. "I was in a decent position most of the time. I followed the Irish rider Felix English and I had a good lead out." Elsewhere Britain's sole rider in the men's keirin, Joe Truman, was outclassed in his semi-final, having tried to take the race out with two laps to go. And in the women's team pursuit, GB finished fifth in the heats and failed to make the bronze-medal ride. Olympic gold medallist Chris Boardman "Latham had a fantastic final charge. He timed his effort well there. "We hardly saw him in the race, he monitored things but that's why. He was waiting for that final sprint. And what a ride that was for him. "But with three laps to go, I would not have said that Teklinski would make it, but he found something from somewhere to just hang on there. "More than 2km out, he effectively started to sprint. It will take him some time to recover from that." Six-time Olympic gold medallist Sir Chris Hoy "I don't think that would be expected. It's the kind of event you can never be super-confident of winning or winning a medal in. "But if you ride sensibly, which he did, he positioned himself very well and didn't waste any energy in the first part of the race. "He marked the danger men and clearly had the legs for the sprint at the end. That's fantastic, a really great result for him and the team." Team pursuit Olympic gold medallist Elinor Barker came into the quartet of Emily Nelson, Manon Lloyd and Ellie Dickinson. The young squad were unable to compete for a medal but Barker remained positive about their progress. She told the BBC: "It's the first Worlds for all of these girls and it's made it a lot more exciting. "The level is so high already physically and technically. We have so much scope for improvement. It's such a good place to be in. "Four years until Tokyo and we've just come fifth at the Worlds." Double Olympic gold medallist Joanna Rowsell Shand said on BBC TV: "Coming into the competition, I don't think anyone expected them to medal. "Until Elinor Barker joined the team today, we had four brand new riders. With an average age of 19, they've all got bright futures ahead of them." Earlier in the day, Olympic bronze medallist Katy Marchant was eliminated from the women's sprint in the first round. The 24-year-old, who claimed bronze behind Kristina Vogel of Germany and fellow Briton Becky James at Rio 2016, was the only female sprinter to travel to Hong Kong. The former heptathlete qualified in 16th place but was ousted by 17th-fastest Lin Junhong of China earlier on Thursday. Marchant is scheduled to compete in two more events - Saturday's 500m time-trial and Sunday's keirin. "I'm really disappointed. I feel like I'm just missing a little bit of zing, which is something that coming off Rio is to be expected," she said. "I didn't get the roar when I got the number on my back today - maybe the fact it's not an Olympic Games or something in the back of my mind telling me that I'm not feeling great. "I know to get knocked out in the first round is not what we expect from a medallist, but the preparation coming into this competition is about the process leading on to Tokyo."

From music festivals to corporate expos, trade fairs to charity auctions, we spend about £375bn a year on events worldwide - £40bn of that in the UK. It seems we gregarious humans still love to press the flesh, chat in person and see things for ourselves, despite the availability of online collaboration tools, teleconferencing and email. And technology is "transforming the meetings and events space," says Mr Aggarwal. "It's a market ripe for automation." Going digital has enabled organisers to send out invitations via social media, email and mobile, and provide attendees with a more integrated registration, travel and hotel booking experience. "We've seen two major changes in the space since we started [in 2006]," says Renaud Visage, co-founder of San Francisco-based Eventbrite, a tech firm that offers an events organising platform. "Social media, which is very important for marketing, and mobile, which can be used for event apps and for checking-in attendees." The company has grown fast, processing about $3bn (£2bn) worth of tickets and powering a million events last year, says Mr Visage. Innovations include dynamic pricing for online seat reservations, depending on where they are in the venue, and the ability to sell merchandise around the event as well. One company benefiting from event technology is Children's Inn, a charity providing accommodation for kids suffering from the rarest forms of disease. Lauren Stabart, assistant director of corporate giving and special events, told the BBC: "Our service costs millions of dollars a year to run, so raising money from sponsors and ticketed events is essential for our survival. "Cvent helped set up our webpage event management platform, where people can purchase tickets and we can offer special promotions, discounts and so on. "Moving from paper-based registration to digital - checking people into events on tablets - was just so seamless and easy," she says. Organisers' guest lists are updated automatically so everyone has access to the same information on their hand-held devices. Technology is also helping to make the events more interactive, she says, with features like "social wall", which projects live tweets onto a wall for guests to read during the event. Since it was founded in 1990, the charity, based in Bethesda, Maryland, has given a temporary home to about 13,000 seriously ill children and their families. Now when you go to a big conference the prospectus and schedule is likely to be included in a dedicated app, perhaps incorporating video content of the presentations and an interactive map of the venue. A company like Eventbase, which developed apps for the 2012 London Olympics and the US South by South West (SXSW) music, film and technology festival, specialises in creating these bespoke apps. At this year's SXSW more than 1,000 iBeacons were installed around the venue. These small devices communicated with Eventbase's smartphone app to establish visitors' exact locations. This enabled anyone who opted in to the service be found by other visitors - useful for networking and socialising. If you missed a speech because you were too busy networking or sampling the refreshments, a well-run event will upload it to the app soon after. "If I hear a great speaker I want to be able to share the recording five minutes later, not two weeks later," says Mr Aggarwal, whose company services 13,000 clients worldwide, including companies like Roche, Rolls-Royce and Yale University. "With easy access to all the presentations, the event extends beyond the weekend and the content lives longer." Event apps and location technology also make it easier for brands to showcase their wares online as well as in the venue, and to target certain visitors with specific messages as they move around. This targeting is helped by visitors detailing their preferences and areas of interest when they register online for the event. With about 20 million events happening each year, but only 50,000 currently offering attendees an in-conference app, according to industry estimates, this a rich area for growth for tech companies. Within the venue, internet-connected devices, such as tablets and smartphones, can make for a more interactive relationship with visitors. Live polling can enliven a presentation, say, and interactive bidding at charity events using technology from the likes of iBid, can help raise more money. Bidders can see the latest bids on a large digital screen, adding to the excitement and the spirit of competition. Nowadays events also encourage tweets and social media updates from visitors which are then projected onto "social walls" around the venue. Mr Aggarwal envisages quadcopter drones buzzing round fulfilling this function in future. And more often, attendee passes and wristbands have RFID (radio frequency identification) and NFC (near field communication) technology built in, so you can log in to interactive displays or register for offers with a simple wave or tap of your device. Mr Visage believes connected wristbands will also act as digital wallets, allowing festival goers to pay for food, drink and merchandise so they don't have to worry about losing payment cards and cash. Technology is also playing an increasingly important role in brand marketing at events, where competition for visitors' attention is fierce. Product displays are integrating voice, face and gesture activation technologies to make them more fun and interactive, says Nick Thompson, founding partner of Knit, a UK technology design company. His firm has developed Twitter-activated jukeboxes, LED light displays activated by sound and gesture, and social media integration with NFC-enabled wrist bands, amongst other digital delights. Virtual reality (VR) headsets will be the next trend at events, he believes. "At some automotive shows this year there have been more VR headsets than cars," he says. "Immersive content is going to play a huge role in how brands engage consumers in brand experiences." Some thought digital technology would kill the live event. Instead, it seems to have given it a new lease of life.

It happened at about 00:30 on Sunday and both men were taken to hospital for treatment. Officers are now asking anyone who saw what happened or who has information to get in touch. They want to talk to people who were in the club or in the immediate area on Saturday night or early Sunday morning and witnessed the disturbance.	Two men were seriously hurt during a disturbance at the Woodburn Miners Club in Dalkeith.
Sterling did subsequently recover some of the losses. But there is certainly a view that the currency would decline if Britain were to decide to leave. Some analysts expect the fall in the value of sterling in the event of a Brexit vote would be very sharp . The concern reflects the view held by many - though by no means all - economists that leaving the EU would undermine the UK's economic performance. How trade and the UK's economy are affected by membership of the EU. There would be a period of uncertainty about access to the EU market for British exporters while new arrangements were negotiated. The ultimate result could be that it would be harder to sell to the EU market. It is argued that foreign investment could be hit by the uncertainty. This would be going on at a time when the UK has a large deficit in what is called "the current account deficit" - which is trade in goods and services plus some international financial transactions. The deficit has to be financed by loans and foreign investment in financial assets. Unease about the economic outlook could mean that foreign investors would only provide the finance for the deficit if sterling were cheaper. There is of course another view, reflected by Economists for Brexit that the UK would prosper outside the EU. For the short term however, it is more likely to be the majority view that moves markets and sterling in particular. Our reporting on the currency markets usually focuses on what's called the spot rates, the exchange rate that an investor pays to buy currency immediately. But they can also buy options, which are rights to buy or sell a currency (or other types of financial asset) in the future at a price fixed in advance. It's a way of getting insurance against a move in the exchange rate. If the move you are worried about doesn't happen you don't exercise the option. So you are insured, but you have had to pay for it. That part of the market suggests that investors do think a leave vote would weaken sterling. That was the message that the Bank of England Governor Mark Carney gave to a parliamentary committee back in March, in rather technical language: "We have seen a marked increase in implied volatility in the options market around the date of the referendum, once the date became known, and the skews in the option market, in other words the purchase of downside protection if the pound was going to depreciate, had gone up quite sharply." In other words, more investors were buying insurance for the time of the referendum against a fall in the pound than a rise. The Bank also says that about half the decline in sterling since November is due to news related to the referendum. Here's another sign. The financial news service Bloomberg calculates what it calls "implied volatility" from the options market. It shows a marked increase for the pound against the dollar as the referendum approaches. John Redwood the Conservative MP and Brexit supporter looks at the sterling issue rather differently. He wrote in his blog: "The pound fell from over $2 in 2008 to $1.4 in 2009 when we were firmly committed to the EU, so we know other influences can generate large sterling movements". And it must be said that Mark Carney fully recognises other factors have influenced sterling in recent months. On the current account issue, Mr Redwood argues that the immediate impact would be beneficial: "The first round effect is to improve the balance of payments by on fifth as we cancel the payments we have to make to the rest of the EU which we do not get back." The leading Brexit campaigner Boris Johnson also rejects the concerns about the impact on the pound from a leave vote:  "The pound will go where it will over the short term. But, believe me, in the long term you can look forward to fantastic success for this countryâ€¦ I think the pound's value will depend entirely on the strength of the UK economy." It's also worth pointing out that a weaker pound now could be helpful to the British economy. It improves the competitiveness of British industry. It makes imported goods more expensive boosting inflation. Normally that would be unwelcome, but not at a time when inflation is well below the Bank of England's target.	The pound has weakened after new polls suggested an increased chance of a vote in the referendum to leave the European Union.
The hosts scored a brilliant first-half try and had the Scots under severe pressure at times after the interval. But from 16-9 down, four penalties from Greig Laidlaw - who had come on for Henry Pyrgos - saw the visitors home. "If we can have frustrating days and a win at the end of them all the time, I will be happy," Cotter said. "It was a game that in the context of the end of a season and a long year, to get the win, to grind it out, I am happy. "I am happy with the character, the way the team applied pressure and finally got the result. It could have gone the other way. "We weathered a very difficult first half, they flew into us and lifted the intensity from last week, we felt that. It took us a while to wear them down, but we are happy with the result. "No coach is ever going to be totally happy and I know we will find parts we need to improve on. It will be a focus next time we come together." Assistant coach Jonathan Humphreys praised the impact of replacement front-rowers Gordon Reid, Fraser Brown and WP Nel, who came on together for the second half in place of Rory Sutherland, Stuart McInally and Moray Low, and earned Scotland some scrum dominance. "I thought they were excellent," Humphreys told BBC Scotland.  "We wanted some energy and they certainly gave us that. "We had to change things up, we were probably over-playing a bit in the first half.  We decided to make it a bit more conservative and try to force them into some errors. "It was probably a game we would have lost just over 12 months ago. The character we showed was fantastic - five metres from our own line, defending 13 or 14 phases, and we managed to keep them out." Media playback is not supported on this device Defeated Japan coach Mark Hammett believes Scotland were allowed to get away with slowing the ball down without punishment during a vital period of the second half. "I'm really, really proud of the effort. We witnessed a really outstanding game here in Tokyo," he said. "I don't think the best team won and even talking to the Scottish coaches, they agree. We are obviously very, very disappointed. "I feel that perhaps the last two Tests we have been slightly disrespected as a team and what we can achieve. In all that attack, particularly in the second half, we did not get the reward. "There was obviously a reason the ball was being slowed down. We worked really hard for that but did not get the outcome we believe we should have had."	Scotland head coach Vern Cotter praised the character of his side to "grind out" their 21-16 win over Japan despite an underwhelming performance in Tokyo.
The annual Bank of Scotland Business Digital Index assessed small firms in five key skills needed to get the most out of being online. It found that fewer than a third of small businesses north of the border lacked these basic skills. This compares to a UK average of 38%. Only London rivals Scotland in terms of this measure. Experts said the lack of key digital skills was a primary barrier to doing more business online, with 15% of firms across the UK stating this was the main barrier, more than doubling since 2015. The skills assessed for the current report were managing information, communicating, transacting, creating and problem solving. The report also noted cyber security was rising in prominence as a reason for small businesses not doing more online. Almost 60% of Scottish firms said they still needed to invest in cyber security, lower than the UK average of 69%. Philip Grant, chair of the bank's Scottish executive committee, said: "It's pleasing to see that the Business Digital Index shows digital maturity is increasing for small businesses in Scotland, however, there are still too many without basic digital skills. "It's clear that being online can open the doors to opportunities, as well as cost and time saving benefits. "We must do more to encourage small businesses based in Scotland to invest in digital skills, allowing them to make the most out of being online and to reap the benefits." Two thousand businesses and charities across the UK were surveyed, including 109 in Scotland. The study was developed along with Doteveryone and Accenture.	Small businesses in Scotland are leading the way when it comes to digital skills, according to a study.
Officers were alerted to the find just south of Porth Neigwl (Hell's Mouth), near Abersoch on the Llyn Peninsula, at about 16:00 GMT on Sunday. Police and members of the coastguard placed a 100m (330ft) cordon around the object. The Ministry of Defence confirmed it was possibly some kind of ordnance. Explosive experts are set to detonate the device on Monday morning to make it safe.	Part of a Gwynedd beach has been closed after a member of the public found a suspected explosive device, North Wales Police has said.
Instead, it was her namesake, Irish politician Joan Collins, who was arrested at a protest against new water meters in Dublin yesterday. The former Dynasty star tweeted: 'No I am not the Joan Collins Who was a rested (sic) yesterday At a Dublin protest meeting !!! The very idea !!" United Left TD Ms Collins said she was taking part in a "peaceful protest". She later tweeted that she should not be confused with the British screen icon. "For the record I'm not @JoanCollinsOBE as I'd never take an honour from a monarch nor did I wear shoulder pads in the 80s. The very idea!" Veteran actress Joan, 81, was made a dame in the Queen's New Year's honours list last year. She is famous for her roles in films like The Stud and The Bitch, and more recently starred in the TV series The Royals. She was previously a patron of UKIP, but said that does not mean she would vote for them, and has declared herself an admirer of former prime minister Margaret Thatcher. Irish parliamentarian Ms Collins sits on the opposite end of the political spectrum. She was among 13 people arrested at the demonstration, which was part of continuing protests against the introduction of water charges in Ireland.	Actress Joan Collins has taken to Twitter to deny that she was arrested in the Republic of Ireland.
The 21-year-old told BBC Sport last year that he was considering an approach from Algeria. The Lille striker was born in France and played for them at every youth level from under-16 but is eligible for Algeria through his parents. The Algeria Football Federation said it "will immediately begin the process of registering the player with Fifa." The federation added Benzia met its president Mohamed Raouraoua this week to finalise his choice to play for the Desert Foxes. Even though Fifa is yet to receive Benzia's request for a switch of nationality, the Algerian football authority is confident of a swift approval by the game's governing body. Benzia has scored 26 goals in 43 appearances during his time playing for France's youth teams. His capture will come as a morale boost for Algeria after they were snubbed by Lyon striker Nabil Fekir last year. Benzia started his career at Lyon where he progressed from the academy to the senior squad and made his senior debut against Nice in May 2012. He switched to Ligue 1 rivals Lille in August 2015 in search of regular football and has already scored five goals in 20 appearances for the club this season.	Former France youth international striker Yassine Benzia has pledged his senior future to Algeria.
Kevin Hurley, Surrey Police and Crime Commissioner, said he had considered seeking her dismissal before she took over the national policing role. Concerns about public protection and child safeguarding in Surrey were down to a "failure of leadership", he said. Mrs Owens said she underwent a "lengthy and thorough" NCA interview process. The Home Office said she was an "exceptional" policing leader. Last November, Mrs Owens, 47, saw off strong competition to be named director-general of the National Crime Agency - one of the most prestigious and highly paid roles in policing. The NCA has responsibility for the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre - known as CEOP. But in the months leading up to her appointment, Mrs Owens's record on child protection had been brought into question by Mr Hurley. Highly critical inspection reports of the force had led Mr Hurley to declare that he had lost confidence in Mrs Owens and was considering starting the formal process - known as Section 38 - that could have led to her dismissal. Criticisms included the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) finding failings in the way the Surrey force had handled the case of 14-year-old Breck Bednar, who was groomed online before being murdered. Mr Hurley had previously been a supporter of his chief constable, extending her contract in 2012 and writing to Home Secretary Theresa May in 2014 to say she had had an "outstanding year". But during the 12 months leading up to November 2015, all that had changed. Emails and documents disclosed to BBC News under the Freedom of Information Act show that over this period, Mr Hurley's confidence in the chief constable's ability to deal with the problems ebbed away. The minutes of a public protection scrutiny meeting on 3 September reveal the PCC's concerns about the force's handling of rape, domestic abuse and female genital mutilation cases - as well as child protection. In September, Mr Hurley wrote a stinging 10-page letter to Mrs Owens saying he held her "personally responsible". He accused her of blaming others for the "litany of failures", claiming it was "an example of moral cowardice". He wrote: "You have failed to act decisively or speedily to address many areas of concern in relation to public protection." Mrs Owens has told the BBC these comments were "ill-considered and inaccurate". Mr Hurley delivered the letter to Mrs Owens at a meeting, during which she declared that she was applying for the NCA post. At the same meeting, Mr Hurley revealed he had been considering starting the formal process that could lead to Mrs Owens being dismissed or having to resign from the force. Mr Hurley then wrote to Sir Tom Winsor, the Chief Inspector of Constabulary for England and Wales, stating concerns that Surrey Police was "failing vulnerable children, rape and domestic violence victims" and asking for assistance. Mrs Owens issued a detailed 19-page rebuttal of the PCC's accusations, saying her 26-year police record was "unblemished" and that she had taken "immediate and muscular" action in response to child protection concerns. But in October, Mr Hurley wrote again to Sir Tom, saying: "I have lost confidence in the chief constable's ability to lead the necessary cultural changes and cannot be sure that, under her command, the threat, risk and harm of public protection-related issues will be properly addressed." Mr Hurley has said he was not asked about Mrs Owens's suitability for the NCA position, and only found out about her new job by a message posted by a journalist on social media. He said that had Mrs Owens not been appointed he would have started the formal dismissal process. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "It is a failure of leadership. The chief constable is the leader. She has let down the constables and sergeants, but more importantly she has let down our most vulnerable victims across the county." The Inspectorate of Constabulary said it had briefed senior officials at the Home Office concerning the inspection work at Surrey, the "nature of the correspondence" from Mr Hurley and discussed the NCA appointment with them. However, it is understood that another inspectorate report, which is due to be published in the coming weeks, is expected to conclude that the force lacks understanding of serious and organised crime groups in Surrey and "requires improvement" in the way it deals with the problem. Mrs Owens said: "I was selected to my current role by the home secretary after a lengthy and thorough process and am now focused on leading the National Crime Agency in its fight to cut serious and organised crime." The Home Office said Mrs Owens was "one of the exceptional policing leaders of her generation". Officials pointed out that she went through a rigorous recruitment and selection process that included a "testing" panel interview. It said professional references and due diligence checks were also undertaken.	New National Crime Agency head Lynne Owens was appointed amid concerns about her performance as chief constable of Surrey Police, the BBC has learned.
He said the Bank took "timely, comprehensive and concrete" action, which acted to "support, cushion and help the economy to adjust". Last month's rate cut to an historic low of 0.25% helped support house prices and the wider economy, he added. He added he was "absolutely serene" about the Bank's preparations for the impact from the Brexit vote. Mr Carney was being questioned by MPs on the Treasury Select Committee about how the Bank handled the referendum outcome and its decision to cut interest rates to a record low. The Bank was criticised by Brexit supporters for saying the economy would be hit from a vote to leave the EU. But Mr Carney said the Bank's decisions had so far been "validated". The "extraordinary preparations" made by the Bank "cushioned" the economy and will help the UK "make a success of Brexit", he told MPs on the Treasury Select Committee. He said the Bank's actions were made in an effort "to help make the leaving of the EU a success as quickly as possible". "This financial system, under the oversight of the Bank of England, sailed through what was a surprise to the vast majority of financial market participants," Mr Carney said. MPs questioned whether the Bank was too aggressive in supporting the economy after the vote. The UK's services, manufacturing and construction industries have all showed signs of recovery in August after taking a hit in July. However, Mr Carney said he was "absolutely comfortable" with the Bank's decision to cut interest rates to 0.25% and pump billions of pounds into the economy. He added that it is "welcome there is a rebound" in the economy. Mr Carney said there has been quite a considerable improvement in mortgage borrowing costs "and we are seeing pass through of our actions". When Labour MP Rachel Reeves raised concerns that the majority of lenders had yet to pass on the full cut in rates, Mr Carney said the Bank expected "virtually" all the rate cut to be passed on to borrowers in the next few months.	Bank of England Governor Mark Carney has defended his action to mitigate the impact of Brexit.
We've learned a lot about the end of the journey, the slave camps and mass graves in the jungles of Thailand and Malaysia. What we haven't heard so much about is how these journeys begin. We travelled to southern Bangladesh, where many of the migrants set off on their perilous voyages. What we have discovered brings a shocking new dimension to this story that speaks of the terrible desperation that is driving this vast movement of people. We met one of the people smugglers on what Bangladeshis proudly boast is the world's longest beach - a vast stretch of sand that runs for more than 120km along the southern coast. Let's call him Kamrul Rahman. He appeared to be in his early 30s.  He said he used to be a fisherman and started in the people smuggling racket greedy for money after his business went belly up. As the surf crashed down on the beach beside us, he calmly explained in chilling detail how the business worked. He said the prison camps were an essential part of the business model and all the migrants knew about them. It seems they are part of what amounts to a sinister and hideously cynical marketing trick the people smugglers have evolved: they offer the voyage for virtually no upfront cost. He said the deal was straightforward and understood by everyone involved. You only pay the main charge - about Â£1,500 ($2,300) when you arrive in southern Thailand. I was amazed. "So the migrants know they will be held in camp before they get to Malaysia?" I asked. "Before they leave from here we tell them if they don't pay they will be put in a prison. You won't get any rice and you will die of hunger", he told me, without any sign of emotion. "If you pay, you will be able to start for Malaysia with honour." We spoke to many migrants and relatives of migrants in southern Bangladesh. They all confirmed his account. Without exception, they said they knew migrants would be held in Thailand until full payment was made. What this suggests is that for the most part this phenomenon isn't strictly human trafficking - where people are bought and sold against their will - but rather a perverted business transaction to which most of the migrants and their families are actually party. The so-called "ransoms" migrants who have been rescued from the camps in Thailand say their captors are actually part of the deal they sign up to when they make the journey. Take a moment now to think about what that tells us about the people who make these journeys. They are so desperate for a better life that they are willing to go with the people smugglers even though they know that they may end up starving to death in a jungle prison camp. Stina Ljungdell, the UN refugee agency representative in Bangladesh, agrees that many migrants do know what they are getting into. If you think about it objectively, it makes a kind of sick business sense for both the smugglers and their customers. The migrants are assured that they only pay the full cost if they actually arrive in Thailand - cash on delivery, if you like. Meanwhile, the smugglers have leverage to guarantee that they get paid. The model has the added advantage, from the perspective of the smugglers at least, of making the decision to attempt the trip much easier. It seems many young men, and it is predominantly young men who seem to make the journey, are lured in the risky and selfish hope that their family will find a way raise the money once they arrive in Thailand. But other migrants make the decision to leave together with their families, judging that it is the only way to lift them out of poverty. We were told that a successful migrant can send as much as 30,000 taka (Â£260/$400) back to his family each month. But many, many migrants don't make it. Within minutes of arriving in an unofficial camp for Rohingya refugees further up the coast, I was surrounded by parents showing me pictures of their missing sons (and occasionally daughters). Some said their sons had left for Malaysia without telling them. Many others, however, said they had sent them off in the hope that they would send money back for the family. According to the smuggler, one in five of the migrants he takes don't make it to Malaysia. Many die before they even reach the camps, he told me. "Some die because of the suffering, some die because of of tension, some die thinking about how to escape from the situation and some people die of hunger after they run out of food. "All people have to die", he said, "that is fate."	Over the last couple of weeks, the world has woken up to the horrific trade in human beings being conducted in the seas of South East Asia.
Media playback is not supported on this device First or minor offences will result in either a warning, fine or order for a match to be played behind closed doors. Serious or repeat offences can now be punished by a points deduction, expulsion or relegation. Jeffrey Webb, head of Fifa's anti-racism task force, said the decision was "a defining moment". He added: "Our football family is fully aware that what is reported in the media is actually less than 1% of the incidents that happen around the world. "We've got to take action so that when we look to the next 20 or 50 years this will be the defining time that we took action against racism and discrimination." Fifa, world football's governing body, passed the anti-racism resolution with a 99% majority at its congress in Mauritius. Richard Conway, reporting for BBC Sport at the congress, said a concern was raised over those who voted against the tougher racism measures. "Former South African apartheid prisoner Tokyo Sexwale, now a Fifa member, urged congress to check cameras to see who voted against racism rules," he said. "Sexwale says (the) 1% vote against demonstrates how football still has to fight against racism." Webb said of the vote against the measures: "I would like to think it was a mistake but I'm glad it wasn't the other way. I'm glad only 1% went that way." Nonetheless, Fifa president Blatter accepted more must be done to eradicate racism. He said: "We need zero tolerance and strict punishments everywhere. We must lead. We must set a tough, uncompromising example. "We can make a difference. We can send a strong signal to the racists that their time is up." Fifa commissioned a task force to address the issue of racism after a friendly game between AC Milan and Pro Patria was abandoned due to racist chanting. Their verdict includes putting an official inside the stadium to identify potential acts of racism and ease the pressure on the match referee. The new rulings standardise punishment across the members, meaning federations will lose the power to impose their own judgements. Further to the regulations that relate to clubs or international teams, the new measures will see any individual who commits a racist offence banned from stadiums for a minimum of five matches. The five-match suspension is one that has been introduced by the Football Association, whose chairman David Bernstein sat on the task force in Mauritius. Also on the task force was Kevin-Prince Boateng, the AC Milan player who led the walk-off in the game against Pro Patria in January. Former England international striker Luther Blissett, an ambassador for anti-racism charity Show Racism The Red Card, admitted to reservations about the new measures. "You've got to applaud them for doing something about it, my thing is when they talk about the 'level' of racism," he told Radio 5 live. "To me, racism is racism. "Fifa have to let it be known where they are going to start this from. Any form of racism is serious enough for the bans to start, they should hit people hard straight away."	Teams could be relegated or expelled from competitions for serious incidents of racism after tough new powers were voted in by Fifa.
His brother Glyn confirmed the death on Twitter, saying his "big brother and hero" had died in New York City. Dillon was a prolific artist who began professional work at age 16, drawing for Marvel UK's Hulk magazine. He was best known for his US collaborations with writer Garth Ennis, creating classic cult comic titles. In his Twitter profile, Dillon, originally from Luton, describes himself as: "A comic book bloke. Co-creator/Artist of Preacher. Co-founder/Editor of Deadline magazine. Artist on Punisher, Judge Dredd and many others." He was born in Luton in Bedfordshire in 1962. When he was 16 he embarked on his first professional job, drawing the character Nick Fury for Hulk Weekly. In the 1980s his career started to take off and he regularly contributed to Doctor Who Magazine, creating the character Abslom Daak. More work followed and he was on the comic anthology Warrior from its inception in 1982. He also drew for the British sci-fi and fantasy comic 2000AD, where he was perhaps best-known for his work as an artist on Judge Dredd. Dillon arrived in the United States in the late 1980s, where some of his most popular strips were created. The Hollywood Reporter says it was at DC's Vertigo imprint that he collaborated with author Garth Ennis, first on the critically acclaimed Hellblazer and then on Preacher. Vertigo Comics paid tribute on Twitter, saying: "We lost a giant among creators and artists today. He will be missed by all of us here." The Preacher strip inspired the US television series of the same name. In a statement, TV company AMC said: "Steve Dillon was an enormously talented illustrator who, with Garth Ennis, created a cult classic comic we were so proud to bring to television." Dillon and Ennis then worked together on multiple series of the Punisher at Marvel, who have described the artist as "a great storyteller" on Twitter, and said they will remember his "incredible work". On his blog of British comics, Lew Stringer who describes himself as one of Dillon's "legions of fans", paid tribute, saying he had: "A natural talent for drawing pages that were easy on the eye and told the story superbly with a fantastic drawing ability."	Steve Dillon, the legendary British comic book artist, known for his work on Preacher, Punisher, and 2000AD's Judge Dredd has died aged 54.
Bangladesh police are investigating the murder of an Italian aid worker who was shot on Monday, with the Islamic State group saying it is responsible. The two-Test series was due to begin in Chittagong on Friday, 9 October. "One man gets killed, an Italian, and the tour is off. We've had 50,000 people killed in Pakistan," Khan said. Khan was referring to figures estimating the number of "fatalities in terrorist violence" in Pakistan since 2003. In May, Pakistan hosted their first home full international fixture since gunmen attacked a bus carrying the Sri Lanka team on its way to play in Lahore in 2009. "A certain amount of tension is likely through terrorism, but they have to trust the Bangladeshis, the Indians, the Sri Lankans and Pakistanis. We give them 100% protection," Khan added. "Some of the countries, like Australia and New Zealand, are perhaps oversensitive." Cricket Australia had initially delayed the team's scheduled departure on 28 September while it worked on a "revised security plan". But it now says that official advice means it had "no alternative but to postpone the tour". The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) said it was "disappointed" by the decision but is "committed to rescheduling the series at a later date". On Wednesday, the BCB had promised "VVIP" treatment for the Australian team, saying they would be given the same level of security afforded to visiting heads of state. England are due to tour Bangladesh to play two Tests and three one-day internationals in October and November 2016.	Australia were "overly sensitive" to postpone their tour of Bangladesh over security concerns, says Pakistan Cricket Board president Shahryar Khan.
The judge described the evidence against Colm Murphy and Seamus Daly as overwhelming. The action was taken by the victims' families, who have been awarded £1.6m damages. Twenty-nine people, including a woman pregnant with twins, were killed in the Real IRA attack on the County Tyrone town in August 1998. Delivering his summary, Mr Justice Gillen recognised the scale of the terrorist outrage for which no one has ever been convicted. "The barrier of time has not served to disguise the enormity of this crime, the wickedness of its perpetrators and the grief of those who must bear its consequences," he said. "Even 15 years on nothing can dilute the pulsing horror of what happened." Lord Brennan QC, who represented the families, said the bereaved relatives were determined that the damages would be paid. "Enforcement will be pursued with vigour here and in other relevant jurisdictions," he said. Michael Gallagher, whose son Aidan was killed in the bombing, described it as an "important judgement". "We will be pursuing the judgement because it would be a very hollow judgement if it was merely words," he said. "We will be doing our best to try and recover the damages but at the moment, we're just happy that we've got a judgement that we, the families, the victims, have held someone to account for what happened at Omagh." During the retrial it was claimed that Colm Murphy supplied mobile phones to the bomb team. Mr Justice Gillen said there was compelling circumstantial evidence that two phones linked to Colm Murphy were used in the attack, with anyone who knowingly provided them to the bomb team liable. The builder's denials about lending his phone to anyone and subsequent explanation to police in the Irish Republic were wholly implausible and amounted to lies with no innocent explanation, according to the judge. The coincidence of a similar unexplained use by the same phone in an earlier bombing in Banbridge was found to amount to further probative evidence of Murphy's involvement in the Omagh operation. "To suggest that for a second time his phone had been mysteriously used without his knowledge moves one into the realm of fantasy," Mr Justice Gillen said. He described Mr Murphy's explanation for failing to give evidence as being due to his lack of confidence in the judicial system as "bordering on the risible". "It makes the prima facie case even stronger and renders it now overwhelming," he added. The same verdict was returned against Seamus Daly, based on his conversation on one of the bomb-run phones less than an hour after the explosion. Mr Daly's guilty plea and conviction for Real IRA membership in November 2000 was also taken into account. "This was relevant not just to propensity but was logically probative in determining the issue of liability in this case," Mr Justice Gillen said. Neither man was at the High Court in Belfast to hear the 73-page judgement. "I have determined that both defendants were involved in assisting the preparation, planting and detonation of the bomb," Mr Justice Gillen said. Stanley McCombe, who lost his wife Ann in the atrocity, said he hoped the Police Service of Northern Ireland and the Garda Siochana in the Republic would now review the evidence following the verdict. "Out of all this, what we have heard from the judge, I think the Gardai, PSNI, and the bodies that be, have to really look at all this information and all this evidence and see if there is a case that these people have to answer for," he said. Mr Gallagher said the Omagh families would be seeking an "early meeting" with the PSNI chief constable, Matt Baggott. "We believe it's important that he looks at the judgement that was delivered, that there could be the possibility of pursuing the individuals that we have held to account in a criminal court," he said. "We just cannot accept that 31 people can be murdered and no-one can be brought to justice for that crime." Following the verdict, Lord Brennan QC, said he wanted the nine-year-long legal battle brought to an end. Opposing a stay on the judgment pending any further challenge, the barrister described the verdict against Mr Murphy and Mr Daly as "damning". "The prospects on appeal are, in our submission, zero," he said. "The defendants have had their full measure of legal aid and the ability to participate in this trial. Let it come to an end." The barrister also confirmed plans to pursue all four men now held liable for the bombing. To date, no-one has been successfully criminally prosecuted for the bombing. In the absence of criminal convictions, the victims' families took a landmark civil action, seeking damages from the men they believed were responsible. The retrial followed the original Omagh bomb civil case, which is believed to be the first time anywhere in the world that alleged members of a terrorist organisation have been sued. The first trial concluded in June 2009, when a judge ruled that four men - Real IRA leader Michael McKevitt, Liam Campbell, Colm Murphy and Seamus Daly - were all responsible for carrying out the atrocity. The 12 relatives who had taken the action were awarded more than £1.6m in damages. Mr McCombe said the families had not received "one single penny" from that judgement. However, the four men who were found liable subsequently launched appeals. Michael McKevitt and Liam Campbell failed to have the civil judgement against them overturned two years later. Colm Murphy and Seamus Daly were successful in upholding their appeals in July 2011, but the pair were then ordered to face a retrial of the civil case. Mr Murphy a Dundalk-based publican and contractor, and former employee Seamus Daly, from Cullaville, County Monaghan, denied playing central roles in the atrocity.	Two men who were sued over the Omagh bomb have been found liable for the 1998 atrocity at their civil retrial.
The League One side have been under the embargo since November because of a £300,000 bill with HM Revenue & Customs and fees owed to other clubs. The Latics are bottom of the table, three points from safety, and are the lowest scorers in the Football League. "As far as I'm led to believe it should be cleared at the latest next week," Robinson told BBC Radio Manchester. "There is money coming in from the league so hopefully we can clear that and we can try and crack on with things." Oldham have not won a league game since 18 October in what is Robinson's first season in charge after arriving last summer. "We've got plans," the 42-year-old added. "We've had plans since November or December time and we've spoken to a lot of players "Obviously it is not an ideal situation as we've not been able to press the button on things. When we get the green light to go and sign people we'll see if they're still available."	Oldham Athletic should be able to exit their transfer embargo within a week, says manager Stephen Robinson.
The data, published in the Lancet, shows that only one in 200 women - or 0.5% - is still doing any degree of breastfeeding after a year. That compares with 23% in Germany, 56% in Brazil and 99% in Senegal. The researchers said it was a "widespread misconception" that breastfeeding was beneficial only in poor countries. In the UK, 81% of mothers had tried breastfeeding at some point, but only 34% were breastfeeding at six months and 0.5% at 12 months. In the US, 79% started, 49% were still going after six months and 27% after a year. It is the worst record in the world. Breastfeeding is far more common in developing countries, but the UK figures are behind even similar countries in Europe. Women in the UK are advised to feed their baby exclusively on breast milk for the first six months and then a combination of breast milk and other foods, however, it does not give a recommend end-point. Breastfeeding is good for the health of the baby and lowers the risk of breast and ovarian cancer. Prof Cesar Victora, report author from the Federal University of Pelotas in Brazil, said: "There is a widespread misconception that the benefits of breastfeeding only relate to poor countries. "Nothing could be further from the truth, our work clearly shows that breastfeeding saves lives and money in all countries, rich and poor alike." The Lancet report said breastfeeding in developed countries reduced the risk of sudden infant deaths by more than a third. And in poorer countries, half of cases of diarrhoea and a third of respiratory infections could be avoided by breastfeeding. Overall, the report's authors said that near-universal breastfeeding could save over 800,000 children's lives a year. A commentary, signed by Save the Children UK and the World Health Organization, was critical of formula milk being promoted at the expense of breastfeeding. It said: "The active and aggressive promotion of breast milk substitutes by their manufacturers and distributors continues to be a substantial global barrier to breastfeeding. "Promotion and marketing have turned infant formula, which should be seen as a specialised food that is vitally important for those babies who cannot be breastfed, into a normal food for any infant." Commenting on the findings, Sarah Redshaw, from the BabyCentre website, said: "It is crucial to bear in mind the various barriers and challenges faced by mums when it comes to breastfeeding. "Generally mums are aware that breastfeeding is best for their baby but often don't get the right support if they encounter problems in the early weeks - which many, many do. "As a result, significant numbers give up on breastfeeding." Follow James on Twitter.	Rates of breastfeeding in the UK are the lowest in the world, an international study shows.
From September, it will offer the language to students also reading international business and politics. While shorter courses are available at other universities, this is the first time Urdu has been included in the title of an official degree. About 100 million people speak it in the world, including 400,000 in the UK. Yasmin Hussain from the Routes Into Languages university consortium campaigned for the introduction of the new degree. She said: "The discourse is that modern foreign languages like French and Spanish are more important. Minority languages aren't seen to be as valued and so it has taken a long time." Students on the full-time courses will have the chance to learn how the language has been used in film and literature, as well as using Urdu to discuss topics related to their core subject. The launch of the course saw students from local schools take part in workshops and activities, as well as performances by poets and musicians. Writer Sabeena Khan was among those at an open day to launch and promote the Urdu courses. She believes young British Pakistanis in particular would benefit from having Urdu as part of their degree. Ms Khan said: "The language is rich in meaning, its style and usage. It's beautiful and I don't want to see it die out, I want to see more people learning Urdu." Urdu facts... ... And it has also contributed a few words to English Sheraz Ali is one of the lecturers who will be teaching the new undergraduate degree course. "There is a demand for Urdu-related jobs not just in this country but also in many others, especially within professions such as teaching and the health and legal sectors," he said. Mr Ali believed the course would attract students from different backgrounds and not just native speakers of the language. He added: "The Urdu degree is open to everyone, not just people from the South Asian diaspora. We live in a multicultural society, where language isn't only a pile of words but something which can bring people together." You can hear more on this story on BBC Asian Network at 17:00 GMT on Friday, or after that on the BBC iPlayer.	Manchester Metropolitan University has become the first higher education institute in the UK to offer students the chance to earn a degree in Urdu.
A 12-week consultation on the scheme, worth up to £1,200 a child, has begun. Families with two working parents could be able to claim, and ministers said carers who look after disabled relatives and others would be included. Chancellor George Osborne said stay-at-home mothers, who had made a "lifestyle choice", would not be eligible. The government says the overall scheme - set to replace the existing system of employer-supported childcare vouchers - will help 2.5 million families. It is aimed at getting more people back into jobs. The UK has some of the highest childcare costs in the world, with many people with two or more children saying it does not make financial sense for both parents to work. The new system is expected be phased in from autumn 2015, with children under five helped in the first year. It will then build up over time to include all children under the age of 12. Families with two working parents on less than £150,000 each would be able to claim up to £1,200 a year per child. Critics have said the focus on work will penalise parents who stay at home to look after their children, or are unable to work because they act as full-time "carers" for other adults. However, extra details released by the government on Monday make it clear that parents who do not work because they are carers will also be eligible. Carers are defined as those spending at least 35 hours a week looking after someone such as a disabled relative. But the scheme will not be extended to those who stay at home to bring up their children. Lisa Frederiksen, from Epsom, Surrey, was "staggered" by childcare costs for her children Casper, four, and Elizabeth, two. She said: "As a career-orientated woman, when I had my first child at the age of 40 I was staggered at the cost of childcare. "My employer would not agree to a part-time role, so I was faced with childcare costs of £1,200 per month. "After my second child, it became  apparent that working was not going to pay. With two lots of childcare and the costs of commuting, it just wasn't worth working. "My Danish husband's family cannot comprehend the cost of childcare here. They pay £300 a month for care in well-equipped, carefully staffed nurseries. "This new scheme is a drop in the ocean, but we need a radical rethink." Mr Osborne told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme: "This is help for formal childcare. Obviously it's not for stay-at-home mothers. "I have huge regard for mothers who want to stay at home and look after their children. That's their lifestyle choice. I want to help those families too. I'm not trying to be exclusive. "We have a proposal on married couples' tax breaks which I'm going to introduce in the Autumn Statement later this year... that will help stay-at-home mothers." Lynne Burnham, secretary of Mothers at Home Matter, called for a "level playing field" for all families, with the introduction of a "family allowance" for all households with children under the age of 16. She added: "It should not be for this government to dictate how a family chooses to care for its children." Under the proposal, parents will be required to open an online voucher account with a voucher provider and have their payments topped up by the government. For every 80p families pay in, the government will put in 20p, up to the annual limit of £1,200. The vouchers will be valid for any Ofsted-regulated childcare in England and equivalent bodies in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Half of the funding for the new scheme will come from the abolition of the previous system of employer-supported childcare vouchers  - which is provided by only about 5% of employers - and in part by funding switched from elsewhere in Whitehall. A separate scheme will provide funding for parents who claim universal credit. It will see the state cover up to 85% of their childcare costs, up from 70% at present. For Labour, shadow children's minister Sharon Hodgson said: "Only David Cameron's government could be so out of touch that they expect families to be grateful for help with childcare in 2015 when they've already seen costs spiralling and support taken away."	The government says it wants to expand a planned childcare tax credit scheme to include parents who stay at home because they are full-time carers.
Jung, 33, had already won at Burghley and Kentucky and completed the treble with a flawless showjumping performance in Sunday's final event. Fellow German Andreas Ostholt finished second on So Is Et, with Britain's Gemma Tattersall third on Arctic Soul. Jung is the second winner of the Grand Slam, emulating Pippa Funnell in 2003. "I think we need a bit of time to realise this very special moment. It's a very big situation," he said. Zara Tindall achieved the Olympic qualification mark on her way to a 23rd-place finish aboard High Kingdom, the horse that took the Queen's granddaughter to team silver at London 2012. Team GB places will not be announced until July but Tattersall has hit the qualifying standard, alongside Tindall, Kristina Cook (seventh on Star Witness), Izzy Taylor  (eighth on Allercombe Ellie) and Ben Way, who came 12th on Galley Light. Jung led after each discipline - dressage, cross country and showjumping - and finished with 34.4 penalty points, a record low at Badminton Park. Ostholt was on 43.4 and Tattersall had 44.6. Tattersall - who had previously finished no higher than 16th at Badminton - made a firm case for Olympic selection. She flawlessly cleared all 13 obstacles in the showjumping finale, as did Ostholt and Jung, ensuring the places stayed the same as at the end of Saturday's cross country. Such was Jung's lead, he could afford to knock down two poles on his final run but sailed through unblemished to earn a standing ovation from a sell-out crowd. Jung will now be a firm favourite to retain his Olympic individual eventing crown and possibly lead his nation to a team title in Rio. Media playback is not supported on this device He spoke of La Biosthetique's trust and called the horse "the best in the world" on Saturday - perhaps unsurprising considering the pair became the first horse-rider combination to hold Olympic, world and European titles in 2012. Ominously for Great Britain - who finished second in team eventing at London 2012 - Jung looks to be in relentless mood as he broke a Badminton points record set in 2006. He also became the first rider to lead from dressage through to conclusion since 2007 but it is the fact he is just the second rider to win a Grand Slam which will make Badminton 2016 live long in the memory of eventing fans. In all, 46 of the 77 horse-rider combinations which started the week made it to the conclusion. A strong New Zealand contingent saw Sir Mark Todd place fourth, raising hope he could compete at a seventh Olympic Games at the age of 60. Todd won individual gold in 1984 and 1988 with a team bronze in Seoul and further bronzes in 2000 (individual) and 2012 (team).	Michael Jung sealed a £240,000 Rolex Grand Slam on La Biosthetique as he became the first German to win a Badminton Horse Trials title.
Accountant in Bankruptcy (AiB) reported 2,405 insolvencies between April and June - 7.8% up on the previous quarter. There were 1,144 bankruptcies, which was up 14.7% on the previous quarter and 51.1% more than a year ago. However, AiB said the figures showed a "return to trend". A year ago, the number of personal insolvencies in Scotland fell to its lowest level for more than 14 years following the introduction of the Bankruptcy and Debt Advice (Scotland) Act. The legislation introduced new measures such as mandatory money advice for people seeking access to statutory debt relief solutions such as sequestration. Although the latest bankruptcy figures were sharply up on a year ago, they were 41.7% lower than the same quarter in 2013-14 and 34.9% lower than in 2014-15. Personal insolvencies include both bankruptcies and protected trust deeds (PTDs). The number of PTDs recorded between April and June remained largely stable at 1,261, a 2.1% increase from the previous quarter. New debt payment programmes approved under the Debt Arrangement Scheme (DAS) fell slightly by 5.2% on the previous quarter, to 510. Quarterly figures for bankruptcies and PTDs since 2005-06: Business Minister Paul Wheelhouse said: "These figures indicate that people are becoming more accustomed to the new insolvency legislation and processes. "We are now seeing the numbers settling down to a more regular pattern following the significant, and expected, drop after the introduction of the new laws. "Compared to the same quarter from two years ago, prior to these changes, the number of people falling into insolvency today is down by more than a third. "This shows those most in need can access the debt relief they require to help them on the road to a fresh financial start - but also that the long term movement is a downward one." Eileen Blackburn, from insolvency trade body R3, said: "This quarterly rise, driven mostly by an increase in bankruptcies, bucks the wider downward trend in Scottish personal insolvencies we've seen in past years. "The number of insolvencies have been falling steadily since their peak in 2012, and this quarter represents a return to more stable levels. "The rise is probably less do with the EU referendum result, which only happened towards the very end of the quarter, and more to do with ongoing difficulties in the Scottish economy and the end of the financial year in March."	Personal insolvency numbers have returned to "relative stability" in Scotland following the introduction last year of new bankruptcy legislation, according to officials.
The victims all worked at the plant 100km (62 miles) east of Porto. The factory's owner was among the dead and several members of his family were either dead or missing, said local mayor Francisco Lopes. Some of the victims were found outside the factory, apparently propelled from the building by the force of the blast. An initial explosion happened shortly after 17:30 (16:30 GMT) on Tuesday, followed by two more blasts, reports said. Five bodies were found late on Tuesday and emergency workers found a sixth victim some 200m (650ft) from the site, minister Jorge Gomes told Portuguese media. The search was being extended to a radius of 800m, he added, because of the scale of the explosion. The factory was described as a family business. As investigators tried to identify the victims, the mayor said that almost all of the eight caught up in the blast were members of Egas Sequeira's family. Mr Sequeira was among those feared dead along with one of his daughters and a son-in-law, Portuguese media said. The owner's wife had left the building just before the explosion and survived but two other family members were among the missing. Officials were initially unable to enter the site because of the potential risk to their safety. Portuguese President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa was due to visit the scene on Wednesday.	Six people died and another two were missing after an explosion on Tuesday evening destroyed a fireworks factory near the Portuguese town of Lamego.
West Indies, who were 11-3 in pursuit of England's 155-9, needed 19 off the final over to win and did it in style. Marlon Samuels' 85 not out kept them in contention before Brathwaite's match-winning blitz off Ben Stokes. Joe Root scored 54 for England but nothing could stop the Windies joining their women as World T20 champions. In the process, the West Indies also became the first two-time winners of the men's World Twenty20. Despite the devastating loss, England can take a lot of encouragement from their performance in this tournament, which has showcased an attacking philosophy and resilience that was completely lacking during their group-stage exit of last year's 50-over World Cup. But for Brathwaite and Samuels, it would have been Eoin Morgan's side capping their rapid improvement with their own World T20 title. Brathwaite came in at number eight, joining Samuels at the crease in the 16th over with the West Indies on 107-6 and needing 49 from 27 balls. The tall bowler had only batted twice in the competition prior to the final, scoring 10 not out against South Africa and 13 against Afghanistan in the group stages. But, with 19 needed off Stokes' last over, he seized his moment with the bat in spectacular fashion. Brathwaite will take the headlines, but man of the match Samuels was the real architect behind the West Indies' victory courtesy of his 66-ball unbeaten 85 - the highest individual score in a World T20 final, beating his own record of 78, scored in 2012. He was brought to the crease in just the second over following the dismissal of Johnson Charles, who, along with fellow opener Chris Gayle, was one of two wickets claimed by surprise opening bowler Root. Lendl Simmons, who scored a match-winning 82 in the semi-final against India in his first appearance in the competition, was trapped lbw by David Willey in the next over to leave the West Indies reeling. Samuels was given a reprieve in the first over after the powerplay as replays of his edge from Plunkett showed it fell just short of Jos Buttler's gloves, leading to the umpire calling him back to the crease after initially raising his finger. But Samuels kept a cool head after this, scoring at around a run a ball to reach 50 and help his side to 86-3 before accelerating with two sixes and a four in a key 15th over from Plunkett. Two wickets in the 16th over by Willey in the following over swung the game back England's way, but Samuels remained to watch on from the non-striker's end as Brathwaite turned the game decisively in the West Indies' favour. It was a cruel end to the game for Stokes, who had excelled in the field, taking four catches. He left the field in tears. England also got off to a horror start in their innings, with Jason Roy bowled through the gate from just the second ball of Samuel Badree's opening over. Alex Hales (1) and captain Eoin Morgan (5) followed soon after as they faltered to 23-3. This united England's best two batsmen at the crease with plenty of overs to attack and Joe Root and Jos Buttler steadied the ship before taking the game to their opponent to forge the best partnership of the innings - 61 from just under seven overs. However, Buttler fell just as he was looking to accelerate and Root was dismissed with just over five overs remaining as the pressure on his shoulders produced the first false shot of his innings - a mistimed, premeditated attempted scoop that gave a catch to short fine-leg Benn and Brathwaite the second of his three wickets. Only Willey would make another notable contribution, hitting two sixes and a four in a quick-fire 21 to help England to their modest and ultimately insufficient total. England captain Eoin Morgan: "It was filled with ups and downs. We let ourselves down with the bat and probably fell about 40 short. "The decision to open the bowling with Joe Root came about in the last couple of days and golden arm took two wickets in his first over. "Throughout this tournament we have shared a lot of good times but we are all in pain tonight. Ben [Stokes] plays all three formats, it will take him a while to come back but I have no doubts he will have a long career and do well in an England shirt." West Indies captain Darren Sammy: "This win is something we are going to cherish for a long time. We have 15 match-winners but nobody gave us a chance. "We felt disrespected by our board, [commentator] Mark Nicholas described us as having no brains and all this brought us together. The ability to put adversity aside and to play this type of cricket is just tremendous." England head coach Trevor Bayliss: "If you add up the white-ball cricket games these guys have played, it's a long way behind other teams. It's a promising side and the signs are good. "Whatever words I come up with the in the dressing room won't be enough. They're hurting, but it will steel them for the future. "We have still got work to do, but we have a lot of good players to work with. England cricket is in good hands." BBC cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew: "Four successive sixes to win, I have never seen that before. England looked absolutely crushed. It's really good to see a smile on the face of West Indies cricket. It's a unique brand of the game and it needs to be nurtured and encouraged." Former England spinner Vic Marks: "It was a staggeringly good final and a very good tournament. I feel desperately sorry for England who played so tenaciously to get back into the match, and especially for Ben Stokes. On the other hand you have to admire Brathwaite and the way he finished the game." BBC Test Match Special commentator Charles Dagnall: "An incredible tournament with an impossible end... Love T20. But feel for Stokes, like the penalty taker who misses in sudden death."	Carlos Brathwaite hit the first four balls of the final over for six as West Indies stunned England to win the World Twenty20.
Nick Woodman described the remote controlled aircraft as the "ultimate" accessory for his firm's action cameras. He made the announcement at the Code Conference in California, where he also unveiled new kit to that helps capture video footage for virtual reality helmets. One industry watcher said GoPro's move into drones was "very significant". "It's the fact that the company has such a strong brand," explained John Stapley from Amateur Photographer magazine. "It's similar to what you can already see with action cameras. There are a lot of others out there but most people don't know they exist or don't have any interest in them because GoPro has become such a dominant name that it is 'the action brand' as far as they are concerned." The risk for the firm, he added, was that other drone manufacturers would opt to partner with other camera makers to avoid supporting a competitor. The world's bestselling commercial drone maker - China's DJI - has already decided to limit initial sales of its Phantom 3 flagship to a design that features its own proprietary video camera. The previous generation had been launched instead with an optional mount for GoPro cams. Mr Woodman said he planned to release the GoPro drone within the first half of 2016, and that it would be targeted at consumers. "Quadcopters have a special place for us at GoPro because I was a huge radio-controlled plane enthusiast as a kid and I could never really get anyone involved in it with me because it was either too geeky or it took a lot of time to learn how to fly these things - you'd crash them all the time," he said. "So, I was really surprised to see how quickly the general consumer was adopting quadcopters. "Quads plus GoPro has been one of the most democratising combinations in terms of enabling people to capture professional quality content and see themselves in their environment in a way that they'd never seen before. It looks like you're in your own movie." Drones are expected to be one of the fastest growing electronics sectors over the coming years. According to the US's Consumer Electronics Association, the global market for consumer drones totalled $84m (Â£54m) last year but is forecast to top $300m by 2018. The CEA adds that if regulators relax the rules for the use of such aircraft by commercial organisations, the market could further swell to $1bn by 2020. That could represent a lucrative new market for GoPro. The firm's existing cameras and other accessories generated $363m of sales over the first three months of 2015. That was up 54% on the previous year, but resulted in a relatively slim net profit of $16.8m. Mr Woodman also showed off a prototype mount that can hold six of his firm's Hero4 cameras, each pointing in a different direction. He said the resulting footage could be stitched together using software developed by Kolor - a start-up it bought last month - to create a single 6K-quality 360-degree image. This could then be used with virtual reality helmets - allowing a user to change their perspective by turning their head left and right and looking up and down - or via YouTube and Facebook, which are both adding support for interactive spherical videos. The Six-Camera Spherical Array add-on will go on sale later this year. Mr Woodman acknowledged, however, that the high cost of buying enough cameras to fill it was likely to limit the mount's appeal to professionals. At a subsequent event, Google also announced a more elaborate virtual reality capture device, which involves 16 GoPro cameras, as part of a tie-up between the two companies. The footage produced by the Jump camera array will be processed by the search firm's own software to produce panoramas, rather than spherical videos, that make use of depth data deduced by Google's algorithms.	GoPro's chief executive has confirmed it will make its own quadcopter drones.
The 22-year-old Scotland international made five appearances for Leeds in 2012 and was released by the Rhinos at the end of the 2013 Super League season. Hood will join his former Leeds team-mate Ben Jones-Bishop at the Red Devils next season. "I'm very pleased that I've got this chance again and I'm going to take it with both hands," said Hood. He told BBC Radio Manchester: "It's a massive challenge. I've had a couple of years out of top-flight rugby and it's a big change. "You don't realise how much it benefits you being full-time. I'm really looking forward to getting back into it."	Salford Red Devils have signed hooker Liam Hood from Championship One Hunslet Hawks on a two-year deal from 2015.
Christopher Meli, 20, was found dead near houses at Glasvey Close. Detectives said he had suffered a sustained and vicious assault. The youths were detained on Tuesday evening. On Tuesday, three teenagers, two aged 18 and a 16-year-old youth, appeared in court charged with Mr Meli's murder. Two teenagers aged 18 and 17, who were arrested by detectives on Sunday, have been released on bail pending further inquiries.	Five more teenagers - two males and three females - have been arrested over the murder of a man in west Belfast's Twinbrook estate at the weekend.
The 19-year-old striker has appeared three times for Newcastle's first team. "It was my first time away from home. My mum's not there to do everything for me, so I've got to be a big man for myself," he told BBC Radio Northampton. "The football's obviously a bit different tempo-wise but I've managed to adapt to it and I'm enjoying it." He continued: "A little bit (of homesickness), missing my family a lot but other than that it's alright." Toney came through the Cobblers' youth ranks and scored 13 goals in 60 senior games, and is also the youngest player to represent Northampton. He was named the Under-21 Premier League's player of the month for September after two goals in three appearances for Newcastle legend Peter Beardsley's side. He also appeared in the Premier League as a substitute in September's 2-2 draw with Chelsea, and says that he is working on physical strength to compete in the top flight. "If you're not sharp, you're not involved," he said. "I wouldn't try to disrespect the League Two standard, but they are sharper (mentally) and know what they are doing a lot more. "You're trying to get stronger every day, especially at that level you need to be strong and fit, and that's the main thing I'm working on."	Ivan Toney has admitted he struggled with homesickness following his summer move from home-town club Northampton Town to Newcastle United.
Jamie Taggart, from Argyll and Bute, failed to return from a plant-hunting trip to the northern mountainous area. He has not been seen since 2 November, when his rucksack and passport were found at a guest house in Sapa. Mr Taggart, 41, runs Linn Botanic Gardens in the village of Cove on the Rosneath peninsula and serves the area as a retained firefighter. Local police and the British embassy in Hanoi have been informed about his disappearance. Friend and fellow botanist Ian Sinclair, who has been liaising with the search parties, said they had been hampered by horrendous weather. "The snow is continuing to melt, but there is a massive amount of snow damage to the forest such as collapsed trees," he said. "The weather has been horrendous, with snow down to Sapa. This is extremely unusual as Sapa is upper tropical rainforest. "A large group from the national park will be doing an intensive search once the snow melts." A search due to begin on Tuesday will concentrate on four trails inside the forest of Lai Chau and Lao Cai, he said. Family and friends of Mr Taggart in his hometown of Cove have issued an appeal for funds to help cover the cost of the search. A Facebook page - Jamie Taggart Search - has also been set up. Organisations and individuals have so far raised thousands of pounds, including six-year-old Annie Ferguson of Cove who donated her Â£14.50 savings. The botanist's father, Jim Taggart, found out his son was missing when he failed to appear on a scheduled flight home to Scotland on 29 November. He had arrived at a guest house in Sapa on 30 October and left on a motorbike taxi to explore the hills. On 2 November his rucksack and passport were found at the accommodation. Dr Taggart previously told BBC Radio Scotland that he had received a handful of text messages from his son before contact stopped. "I don't think he had got lost. Either something happened to him on his first day on the hills or there is some explanation we can only guess at," he said. A Foreign and Commonwealth Office spokesman said: "We are still in close contact with the local authorities and are providing consular assistance to the family at this difficult time."	The search for a Scots botanist missing in Vietnam is expected to resume later after being abandoned in heavy snow.
Gordon, 53, is also the National League club's major shareholder and chief executive, and has been in charge of the first team since Dave Hockaday left the role in January. "I think what he's done with the players he's had has been amazing," Brown told BBC Hereford and Worcester. "We haven't always had results, but the football's been the best I've seen." Harriers have struggled all season in the aftermath of major financial problems and look certain to be relegated as they are 12 points adrift of safety at the bottom of the National League table with only nine games to play. Gordon, who has stated that he does not want the head coach's job full-time, previously had a four-game spell in charge following Gary Whild's departure in September. "Colin has a lot of interests in the football club and has a lot of skills," Brown continued. "He is not sure whether his skill-sets are right to be head coach, but I think he should be part of it. "I can see his vision and the brand of football he wants to play and if I don't get him to do it, then second best thing would be that he's part of a team managing the club." Media playback is not supported on this device Brown admitted Harriers were effectively 'bust' last November before Gordon bought a majority stake in the club,  but over the last 12 months have filled a financial "black hole" of £300,000 and reduced the playing budget from a peak of £800,000 two seasons ago to £260,000 at the start of this term. With the club now on the way to becoming self-sufficient, he is adamant they will remain a full-time outfit. "We will break even this year - the first time in 15 years and that's very gratifying," Brown added. "Full-time football can be sustainable and I've got no doubt the future is bright."	Kidderminster chairman Rod Brown says he wants interim head coach Colin Gordon to take the job permanently.
A number of men, two of them believed to have been carrying guns, forced their way into the property at Oakfield Drive shortly after 20:00 GMT on Saturday. They demanded money before assaulting a man aged in his 50s. The gang made off with a sum of cash. Alliance East Antrim MLA Stewart Dickson has condemned the attack. "This was a particularly vicious assault, coming as it did in front of a family," he said. "Those behind it must be taken off the streets immediately, as they pose a serious danger to all," he added.	A man has been assaulted while a woman and four children escaped injury during a raid of a house in Carrickfergus, County Antrim, by an armed gang.
Prosecutors said Darren Byrne, 40, struck Maria Byrne, 35, on the head at their home in Theydon Bois after she discovered he was having an affair. The jury was told Mr Byrne doused his unconscious wife in white spirit and turned on the hob before going out. At Chelmsford Crown Court, Mr Byrne denies murder and arson in February. Prosecutor Andrew Jackson said former city trader Mr Byrne and his wife had a row on the morning of 13 February after she found he was continuing an affair with a married woman. Mr Jackson said: "It's the prosecution case that the catalyst for this alleged murder was Maria Byrne's discovery for the second time of his alleged infidelity." The court was told that after dousing his wife's body with the flammable liquid he went on a walk with the family dog.  CCTV footage showed he was away for more than an hour. Returning to find his plan had not worked, he concocted a charade, said the prosecutor. He called the emergency services to say his wife was "burned" and told the operator: "The stove was on and the frying pan's on the other side of the room. She's not breathing." Mr Byrne told paramedics his wife had been making him a bacon sandwich and when he returned home she was dead, the court heard. A post-mortem examination identified white spirit on Mrs Byrne's clothing and a half-empty bottle of white spirit was found in the garage, the jury heard. The couple had two children together who were not at home at the time of their mother's death. The trial continues.	A man killed his wife and then took their dog out for a walk while he hoped their house would burn down with her inside, a court has heard.
Screen grabs showing the website with messages from gay activists are being circulated on social media sites. In one, the prime minister apologises to all homosexuals living in Uganda and gives his support to a gay pride march. Homosexual acts are illegal in Uganda and gay people have faced physical attacks and social rejection. Earlier this year, a controversial anti-gay bill, which proposes to increase the penalties for homosexual acts from 14 years in jail to life, was re-tabled in the Ugandan parliament. The bill was first introduced in 2009 but never debated - and the MP backing the legislation says a clause proposing the death penalty will be dropped. It originally said those found guilty of "aggravated homosexuality" - defined as when one of the participants is a minor, HIV-positive, disabled or a "serial offender" - would face the death penalty. The Uganda Justice Law and Order Sector website was also reportedly taken over by hackers this week. Ambrose Ruyooka, commissioner for the Information Communications Technology ministry, told the BBC the problem had now been rectified. The government has created a directorate of security for all government websites and tightened cyber laws to counter rising cyber crime, he said. An activist named @DramaSett3r on Twitter is said to be behind the attacks. The operations were carried out by a group known as The Elite Society and the Anonymous hacktivist community, the activist said. On Wednesday, the official website of Prime Minister Amama Mbabazi quoted him as saying: "We have got to expel the narrow mindedness from this country, and begin afresh, starting with a full and formal apology to all homosexuals living in Uganda today," screen grabs on Twitter and Facebook show. A message allegedly posted by the hackers on the prime minister's site on Tuesday said: "Your violations of the rights of LGBT [lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender] people have disgusted us. "All people have the right to live in dignity free from the repression of someone else's political and religious beliefs." The East African nation is a largely conservative society and many people condemn homosexuality both as unAfrican and unChristian. Western donors have recently said they could withdraw aid from those countries, including many in Africa, which do not recognise gay rights.	The Ugandan prime minister's website was attacked by hackers on Tuesday and Wednesday, a government official has confirmed to the BBC.
The 33-year-old Portugal international has agreed a one-year contract. The ex-Genoa and Braga man "will provide experienced cover and competition for Thibaut Courtois and Asmir Begovic", Chelsea said. "All the colleagues I have always say the dream is to come to the Premier League, where there are the best clubs and the best players," Eduardo added.

Its annual report singles out President Donald Trump as an example of an "angrier and more divisive politics". But it criticises other leaders, including those of Turkey, Hungary and the Philippines, who it says have used narratives of fear, blame and division. The group also says governments are exploiting refugees for political ends. The report, which covers 159 countries, cited a rise in hate speech across the US and Europe targeting refugees and said the reverberations would see more attacks on people on the basis of race, gender, nationality and religion. It criticised countries that, it said, once claimed to champion rights abroad and that were now rolling back human rights at home. "Instead of fighting for people's rights, too many leaders have adopted a dehumanizing agenda for political expediency," Salil Shetty, secretary general of Amnesty International, said in a statement. "The limits of what is acceptable have shifted. Politicians are shamelessly and actively legitimizing all sorts of hateful rhetoric and policies based on people's identity: misogyny, racism and homophobia." The group made special reference to Mr Trump's executive order last month that banned refugees and immigrants from seven mostly Muslim countries from entering the US. It said Mr Trump put "his hateful xenophobic pre-election rhetoric" into action by signing the measure. The US president, who recently said he was the "least racist" and "least anti-Semitic person", is expected to unveil an updated order this week. But Amnesty also mentioned Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban as leaders who were using the "us versus them" rhetoric. "2016 was the year when the cynical use of 'us vs them' narratives of blame, hate and fear took on a global prominence to a level not seen since the 1930s," Mr Shetty added, citing the year when Adolf Hitler rose to power in Germany. "A new world order where human rights are portrayed as a barrier to national interests makes the ability to tackle mass atrocities dangerously low, leaving the door open to abuses reminiscent of the darkest times of human history." Kate Allen, director of Amnesty UK, criticised as "shameful" the recent decision by the British government to halt the scheme which allowed the entry of unaccompanied refugee children already in Europe, estimated to be 90,000. The group also cited in its report: The London-based group exceptionally launched its report in Paris, saying that France has seen an erosion of its rights in the name of security. The French government says its measures, which followed a series of attacks in 2015, are necessary to protect the country.	Politicians who have used a divisive and dehumanised rhetoric are creating a more divided and dangerous world, says rights group Amnesty International.
28 June 2016 Last updated at 08:03 BST On 1 July 1916, British soldiers started fighting in the Battle of the Somme. The people in charge said that the battle had to happen to win the war. But by the time it was over, more than a million soldiers on both sides had died or were injured. Even now people can't agree on whether it was the right decision or a huge mistake. Martin has been to the trenches in northern France to find out what happened.	This Friday marks the 100th anniversary of one of the deadliest battles in World War One.
The incident happened on the Whiterock Road at about 15:00 GMT on Friday afternoon. Police said it was witnessed by people waiting to pick up prescriptions, including children. The man has been charged with two counts of criminal damage, disorderly behaviour and of assault on police. He is due to appear at Belfast Magistrates Court on 5 December.	A 34-year-old man has been charged after windows were smashed and a doctor was verbally abused at a west Belfast health centre.
They know him of old, of course, but for many this is a potentially new David Cameron, freshly elected with an unexpected majority. Many leaders got rather irritated with the prime minister in the long lead up to the election. They felt he played too much to the Eurosceptic gallery at home when abroad on EU business. Will this new David Cameron be a man they can work with, they wonder? They'd like to. With the UK's in/out referendum EU on membership looming large in European headlines, most want to ensure Britain stays in, especially in Germany, as I found out earlier this week on a trip to Berlin. The UK's former ambassador to Germany, Sir Peter Torry, describes the country as the best friend and ally the UK could have in its EU renegotiation. Pretty useful for Mr Cameron, as Germany is Europe's most powerful nation. There are very practical reasons why Germans are so keen to keep Britain in - and not just because they share a love for sausages and beer, as one student I chatted to suggested. German businesses appreciate Britain's free trade, single market, and anti red-tape push. They see this as a counterweight to the EU's more protectionist, interventionist countries. German taxpayers agree with the UK's drive to crack down on welfare claims by migrants. And Germany is very keen to avoid having to pay even more into the EU budget. It would end up making up most of the shortfall if the UK walked away. So there's lots of good will, but no blank cheque. I asked German MP Michael Fuchs, of Angela Merkel's CDU party, how far the Chancellor would go to help Britain. She'll offer "utmost flexibility", I was told, but there would also be red lines. There is little appetite in Germany or anywhere outside Britain for fundamental changes to existing EU treaties (for example to curb the freedom of EU citizens to live and work where they like in the EU). Though the suggestion has been made in several countries that when treaties are eventually changed to facilitate more harmony in the eurozone, that's when the UK could possibly have its own treaty-changing elements written in. But the timing looks wrong for Britain. German Finance Minister Wolgang Schaeuble says any treaty change is unlikely before the UK holds its EU referendum. But there is a widespread hunger for EU change - from the north amongst the Scandinavian countries to Europe's southern reaches. Governments realise that, with near deflation and high youth unemployment, especially in Spain, France and Italy, the EU is failing to live up to the aspirations of its almost half a billion citizens. The question for Britain's prime minister is whether the change favoured by his European partners match the changes David Cameron wants? Not all his European counterparts are prepared to be as open as Angela Merkel when it comes to UK requests. Not everyone would be as regretful as Germany if the UK were to leave. David Cameron has announced he will begin bilateral visits with his European colleagues as soon as this summit is over. They expect concrete details on what exactly Britain wants from the EU by the leaders' next summit at the end of June.	EU leaders are curious to meet the British prime minister when he joins the Eastern Partnership Summit in Riga.
Patrick McGinley, 46, and his son William McGinley, 27, of Lisfarrell, Edgeworthstown, County Longford are accused of murdering Bernard McGinley. He was shot dead outside a wedding in Newtownbutler in February. The two men are to be released on conditions including a Â£50,000 cash surety and daily reports to police. The court was told the weapon used in the shooting in February 2015 has not been recovered	The Public Prosecution Service has lost an appeal against the granting of bail for two men charged with murdering a relative at a wedding in Fermanagh.
Margaret Jamieson, 70, from Peebles, suffered fatal injuries in the accident at about 16:40 on Monday on the A703, north of Redscarhead. Two other people - a man and a woman - were seriously injured and were taken to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh. Police have urged anyone who witnessed the crash, involving a Nissan Quashqai and a VW Caddy, to contact them.	Police have named a woman killed in a crash between a car and van near Peebles in the Borders.
The John Deere tractor was pulled over by officers in the village of Ripley and had two other males on board. The vehicle had been seen in nearby Harrogate at about 05:00 GMT with no headlights on. Police said the driver had no licence, was not insured and did not have permission from the tractor's owner. The vehicle was seized, with the three due to be interviewed by officers. Posting on Twitter, Insp Chris Galley said: "A strange end to a night shift. 15-year-old lad driving a tractor as a taxi for his drunk mates."	A tractor being driven by a 15-year-old boy "as a taxi for his drunk mates" has been stopped by police in North Yorkshire.
Chris Dent's 100 off 111 balls was the backbone of Gloucestershire's total of 260 all out. In reply, an 87-run fourth-wicket stand between Johann Myburgh (81) and James Hildreth (48) had the hosts on course until six wickets went down for 32. But Jamie Overton put on 65 for the last wicket with Tim Groenewald as Somerset claimed victory on 263-9. Overton made 40 and Groenewald hit 34 in an unbroken stand of 65 off 49 balls, the second highest 10th-wicket stand to win a one-day match in England. After the trophy holders were put into bat by their neighbours, Dent played exceptionally well whilst his teammates fell around him, reaching three figures off 107 balls before being caught at cover off Groenewald. Spinner Roelof van der Merwe starred for the home side, running out Iain Cockbain as well as dismissing Benny Howell, Tom Smith and bowled Craig Miles off the final ball of Gloucestershire's innings. The visitors reduced their local rivals to 15-2 as Adam Hose and Peter Trego fell cheaply. But they rallied well until Myburgh picked out long-off off Dent to fall for 81 and begin a middle-order implosion. Lewis Gregory was then superbly run out and Hildreth was caught and bowled by Smith in the next over as Somerset fell from 166-3 to 198-9. But, with 63 still needed to win, Overton and Groenewald refused to go down without a fight in this local derby, finding the boundary with ease. They survived one near miss when, with the hosts still needing 13 off 3.1 overs, wicketkeeper Gareth Roderick missed a golden opportunity to run out last man Groenewald.	Somerset beat One-Day Cup holders Gloucestershire by one wicket with just three balls to spare at Taunton.
Portugal international centre-back Alves became Caixinha's first signing as Rangers boss last week. And McCarthy, who was at Porto when Alves was breaking through, insists he will prove a shrewd capture. "He'll bring something different to Rangers and beef up their defence, so he's the right defender to bring in," McCarthy told BBC Scotland. "Bruno has a wealth of experience, he's played at the highest level and he's a winner. "He'll give them a bit more stability at the back, more bite, he's a leader and he'll organise that defence. His communication won't be a problem because his English is very good. "Bruno is very composed and calm on the ball so he will help the way the manager wants to play things from the back. Bruno is the perfect fit for what the manager is trying to bring to Rangers right now." As impressed as McCarthy is by the signing of Alves, he reckons Rangers will have to bring in a few more players of a similar calibre before they will be in a position to seriously challenge Celtic. Brendan Rodgers' side finished 39 points ahead of the Ibrox outfit as they won the Premiership and went on to secure an unbeaten domestic treble. "I'm not too sure he'll be able to change that because Celtic are so strong," McCarthy said. "It's going to take more than one Bruno Alves in that Rangers side to take the title from Celtic, but if they sign a couple more players like Bruno, then I think Rangers are in with a shout of giving Celtic a run for their money." Alves began his career at Porto and had various loan spells before becoming a first-team regular, winning nine major honour with the Dragons. He joined Zenit Saint Petersburg for £18m in 2010, with whom he won two league titles and the Russian Super Cup before joining Turkish giants Fenerbahce for £4.5m in 2013. There he won one league title and the Turkish Super Cup and then in 2016 he moved to Italian Serie A side Cagliari, from whom he joined Rangers. Part of the Portugal squad that won the European Championships in 2016, Alves has 89 caps for his national side, and McCarthy is convinced the defender has a lot more football left in him, despite being 35 years old. "He's a fitness fanatic and looks after himself exceptionally well so that will keep him going for a few years," he added. "The experience that he'll bring, Rangers really need it from what I've seen last season." And the South African has assured Rangers fans that while Alves is the type of robust defender they need, he will not be a regular in the notebooks of Scotland's referees. "Everybody has a bit of temper in him but Bruno will choose his moments wisely, he's a senior player in that squad and he has to be an example," McCarthy added. "He can't do silly things that leave the team hanging because they will depend on his experience and to guide the young players. I don't think he'll end up in hot water too many times but he'll bring some fight to that Rangers defence."	Benni McCarthy says his former Porto team-mate Bruno Alves is the perfect fit for Pedro Caixinha's Rangers.
In July, Conor McGinn, who is from south Armagh, claimed the Labour leader suggested phoning his father. It followed an interview in which he called for Mr Corbyn to "reach out beyond his comfort zone". A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said at the time that it was "untrue". The St Helens MP told BBC Radio Four's Westminster Hour: "The modus operandi that he (Mr Corbyn) and the people around him were trying to do, involving my family, was to isolate and ostracise me from them and from the community I am very proud to come from -  which is an Irish, nationalist community in south Armagh." The MP claimed that after he spoke out about Mr Corbyn in May, he got a call from the Labour whips' office saying the party leader had initially asked for his resignation and then considered sacking him. But subsequently, through his spokesman, he had asked for an apology and retraction, which Mr McGinn refused to make. The MP said he then texted the Labour leader to make clear no offence was intended and reiterate that their friendship was important to him and asking for a meeting. He received no response, but said he was then informed by the whips' office that Mr Corbyn had proposed asking the MP's father, Pat, to intervene. Pat McGinn was Sinn Féin councillor in Newry for many years, serving as the council's mayor between 2005 and 2006.	A Labour MP who accused Jeremy Corbyn of threatening to use his father - former Sinn Féin mayor Pat McGinn - to "bully me into submission" has spoken publicly about the row.
Japan's shares rose despite a central bank survey showing firms expect inflation to rise 1.4% a year from now, casting doubts on the bank's pledge to hit 2% this fiscal year. The Nikkei 225 ended up 1.5% at 19,312.79, leading the region's gains. That is its biggest daily percentage gain since 12 February. Investors are also awaiting key jobs figures from the US on Friday. Concerns over the health of the world's largest economy were raised after data on Wednesday showed the pace of US manufacturing growth in March eased to its slowest in nearly two years. The dollar remained under pressure, buying 119.62 yen. In China, the Shanghai Composite closed 0.4% higher at 3,825.78, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng index ended up 0.8% at 25,275.64. In Australia, the S&P/ASX 200 closed up 0.7% at 5,898.6 as bank stocks were boosted on growing expectations of an interest rate cut by the central bank next week. A private survey also showed that inflation rose from a five-year trough in March as petrol prices rebounded. The TD Securities-Melbourne Institute's monthly measure of consumer prices rose 0.4% in March, from February when it had been unchanged. The annual pace was up to 1.5%, from 1.3%, but stayed well below the central bank's target band of 2% to 3%. The Australian market will be closed on Friday and Monday for the Easter holiday. South Korean shares closed flat after data showed the country's seasonally-adjusted current account surplus in February at a record high for the second consecutive month. Exports in February rose by 2% from January while imports fell 0.4%. The benchmark Kospi index was at 2,029.07.	Asian shares rose on Thursday despite investors being cautious ahead of a Good Friday public holiday in some major markets.
In a telephone call, US Secretary of State John Kerry told Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi the US had "strong concerns" over recent developments. Last week, Chinese and Vietnamese ships clashed over the drilling rig that China has placed in waters near the disputed Paracel Islands. China and Manila are also at odds over overlapping territorial claims. Beijing claims a U-shaped swathe of the South China Sea that covers areas other South East Asian nations say are their territory. The issue has been rumbling in recent years amid an increasingly assertive stance from China over its claims. Last week, several collisions were reported between Chinese and Vietnamese vessels in disputed waters as the Vietnamese ships sought to prevent the installation of the Chinese drilling rig. Reports suggest the stand-off - involving dozens of ships - is continuing, with water cannon fire being exchanged. On Sunday, anti-China protests took place in several Vietnamese cities. It is the most serious confrontation between the two nations for several years. In Monday's telephone call, Mr Kerry "said China's introduction of an oil rig and numerous government vessels in waters disputed with Vietnam was provocative", US State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said. "He urged both sides to de-escalate tensions, ensure safe conduct by their vessels at sea, and resolve the dispute through peaceful means in accordance with international law." Separately, in comments made at a meeting with the Singaporean foreign minister, Mr Kerry called the Chinese move an "aggressive act". Mr Wang, meanwhile, urged Mr Kerry to be objective on the issue, a Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman said. Tensions between Beijing and Manila are also running high, after the Philippines arrested and then charged nine Chinese fishermen with poaching at a disputed shoal. The Philippines is in the process of taking China to a UN court over its territorial claims. It has also recently signed a new security deal with the US which would allow an expanded US troop presence, in a move seen as linked to Manila's deteriorating ties with Beijing. On Tuesday, Chinese state media slammed the Philippines, saying that if it continued to challenge China it would pay "an unaffordable price".	The US has warned China that moving a drilling rig into seas disputed with Vietnam was "provocative".
A statement from Greaves's family said the 75-year-old, who had a minor stroke in 2012, had been taken ill on Sunday. Greaves scored 44 goals in 57 England games and a club-record 220 league goals for Tottenham having started his career at Chelsea. "His wife Irene and four children have asked for privacy during what is a worrying time," added the statement. "Jimmy had a minor stroke in 2012, but appeared to have made a full recovery. "He was due to be inducted into the Tottenham Hotspur Hall of Fame on 13 May at a sell-out ceremony at White Hart Lane." Greaves is fourth on the list of all-time England goalscorers, behind Sir Bobby Charlton, Gary Lineker and Wayne Rooney. He was part of England's 1966 World Cup-winning squad but originally missed out on a medal because he was injured during the tournament's group stage. At the time, only the 11 winning players on the pitch at the end of the final received the award, although football's governing body Fifa changed that practice in 2007. The World Cup squad players and the families of team manager Sir Alf Ramsey and other backroom staff were finally presented with medals in 2009. Tottenham posted a message of support on their official Twitter feed shortly after the news of Greaves's stroke emerged. "Everyone at the club wishes Jimmy Greaves a speedy recovery after he suffered a stroke yesterday," the message read. "Our thoughts are with Jimmy and his family at this difficult time." Greaves scored 124 league goals for Chelsea, then a club record, between 1957 and 1961. Chelsea tweeted: "All at Chelsea are thinking of former Blue Jimmy Greaves and his family at this time. We wish him a full and swift recovery." England World Cup winner Sir Geoff Hurst, who scored a hat-trick in the 1966 final, said on Twitter: "Thinking of my friend and one of our greats this morning. Wishing him all the best and hoping for a speedy recovery." Hurst replaced Greaves in the England team in 1966 after he injured a shin against France during the group stages. Greaves helped Tottenham win the FA Cup in 1962 and 1967, while his career also included spells at AC Milan and West Ham United. In the 1980s he forged a new career as a football pundit on ITV, most notably alongside former Liverpool striker Ian St John on 'Saint and Greavsie', which ran from 1985 to 1992. Former Tottenham striker and BBC Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker tweeted: "Choked to read that Jimmy Greaves has had a severe stroke. One of my absolute heroes. Thoughts are with him and his family. Get well, Jimmy."	Former England and Tottenham striker Jimmy Greaves is in intensive care after suffering a severe stroke.
Sabah Saleem, 11, and three-year-old Rayhan were hit by a car driven by 37-year-old Mohammed Khalil Anwar on Brudenell Road in August 2012. Leeds Crown Court heard that Anwar, of Brudenell Mount, failed to stop as he feared being attacked by local people. Anwar is due to be sentenced on 29 November. Sabah and Rayhan, who were 10 and two at the time of the incident, were knocked down by Anwar's Vauxhall Astra car on 18 August last year. They were returning from a greengrocer's shop with food for the family's Eid celebrations which were due to take place the following day. Both underwent surgery at Leeds General Infirmary. While Rayhan was discharged from hospital a few days later, Sabah remained in hospital for about six months and surgeons operated on her several times. The court was told she had been left with "significant and permanent" disabilities as a result of the crash. During his trial, Anwar told the court he was in control of his car at the time of the collision, but he had no time to react when Sabah and Rayhan ran out in front of him. The court heard Anwar was driving at nearly 35 mph along Brudenell Road when he collided with the two children, about 15 mph faster than the speed limit. Anwar admitted he did not know the speed limit was 20 mph along that stretch of road, even though he had regularly driven along there over the past 12 years. He told the court he drove off after hitting the children as he was afraid he would be attacked. Following the verdict, Sabah said she still could not remember anything about the accident. While she still found it "very difficult" to walk, she was now feeling "okay", she said. Sabah's father, Saleem Rafique, said his "very brave" daughter was still recovering. The 11-year-old continues to suffer from double vision, balance problems and memory loss, he said. "She was a really bright kid, doing really well at school and very determined to succeed. "Unfortunately, this happened and that has put her back. "She's tough, she's a real fighter but we don't know whether she will be the same as she was before. It's very hard to tell."	A driver has been convicted of a hit-and-run crash in Leeds which left a girl permanently disabled and her brother seriously injured.
The 28-year-old has scored 37 goals in 98 appearances since joining the Lions from non-league Halifax in 2014. "Lee committing his future to us is a big boost for everybody and a sensible decision from the boy," boss Neil Harris told the club website. "He has played his best football under me and he is a big part of this squad."	Striker Lee Gregory has signed a new contract with League One side Millwall, which will keep him at The Den until the summer of 2018.
About 10 caravans arrived at the King George V playing fields car park in Topsham Road, Exeter on Friday. Nigel Parker, the Central Youth Football Club chairman, said he could not have children walking through their campsite to the changing rooms and had cancelled all games this weekend. He described the situation as "irritating". "They are parked next to the changing rooms. I couldn't take the risk," said Mr Parker. The site has a number of full-sized football pitches, a youth rugby pitch and a children's playground. Labour councillor Marcel Choules said: "It's disastrous that the football matches have had to be cancelled as a result. "People aren't against travellers, what people are against is the disruption caused." A spokesman for Exeter City Council, which owns the site, said they have attended for an initial inspection. The travellers are yet to comment.	Fourteen football matches have been cancelled after travellers set up camp next to playing fields.
Scotland voted No to independence in 2014 following an often frenzied campaign and a record-breaking turnout of 84.6%. But things have changed since then - most notably the decision by the UK to leave the European Union. So have Scottish voters changed their minds? Ruairidh Forbes was so keen to vote No to independence in 2014 that he delayed moving from Edinburgh to London where he was due to begin a PhD in physics. Ruairidh, from North Berwick, says he was not convinced that the financial security of an independent Scotland could be guaranteed. But now he plans to vote Yes. "I am worried about a decline in science and technology funding in the UK after Brexit," Ruairidh explains. "Independence is our best shot at staying in the EU." Ruairidh is now three years into his doctoral studies and sees the benefits brought to the UK by the Â£7.6bn received from the EU for scientific research in 2007-13. "The British government relies on EU funding to prop up UK science and technology - I am worried that the sector will collapse once Brexit happens. "This means that we won't be able to take part in visionary research or cutting-edge projects like the Large Hadron Collider at Cern in Switzerland." "There are no contingency plans being laid at Westminster." Although there is no guarantee that an independent Scotland would become a member of the EU, Ruairidh believes signs suggest that voting for independence is Scotland's best chance to preserve science and technology research. But is he worried that this is also a vote for the SNP, a party that he does not support? "I don't think they are the right party for Scotland - I'm not a nationalist, I see myself as British. "But I believe the independence movement is motivated by social issues and this is a unique opportunity for fairer politics." Hadron Collider: Has it discovered a new particle? "I used to think Scotland had the ability to do well alone," explains Nichola Dadds, who is 50 and lives in Edinburgh. "I voted Yes to independence in 2014 but a lot has changed since then." Nichola wanted to stay in the EU - but now that Britain has decided to leave, she is worried that as a small country Scotland would be marginalised in the European Union. "Much of Scotland's trade is with the UK or non-EU countries like China or the US - if we left the UK, I am not convinced we could get a good trade deal. "I would be concerned about joining the EU as a small country. Look at countries like Ireland and Italy - they have little say in Europe," explains Nichola. "I believe if Scotland became independent from the rest of the UK we would end up beholden to the EU and my thoughts are, 'Better the devil you know,'" Nichola says. Instability caused by the fallout from Brexit is another reason why she changed her mind. "I want to vote for stability and security. We have had enough of referendums - it is time to get used to what is going on instead of causing more disruption." Scotland's trade with UK rises to Â£50bn Keeping Scotland out of the European Union is Steven Calvert's motivation to change his vote from Yes to No. In 2014 Steven, who lives in Inverness, voted for independence as a protest vote against the Conservative government in Westminster. "I voted yes to escape David Cameron and rule by a party that Scotland did not vote for. "But now I plan to vote No - I want Scotland to be out of the EU and independence could jeopardise that." Steven wants to set up a seafood export business and opposes the fishing regulations that come with EU membership: "People here talk about how the EU has made it hard for small fishermen to make a living. "Big trawlers come in from countries like Spain, and we can't find a place to fish. "I think Scotland leaving the EU gives us the chance for a more sustainable quota, hopefully encouraging restoration of the Scottish fishing industry. That would offer good jobs to young people, especially in rural areas." Reality check: the impact of the EU on farming and fishing Jessica Orr felt ashamed in 2014 that she did not vote for independence. "I'm very sensible and pragmatic - I felt that it was too risky, but all my friends and colleagues voted Yes," she explains. Now she has a second chance, she plans to do things differently. "I feel like after Brexit and President Trump's victory, politics has become really degraded and I've realised how positive the independence idea is. "I'm frustrated that we've been forced to leave the EU despite the fact that Scotland did not vote for it. "Without the EU, I feel like we will be worse off, and I am frustrated about the changes to immigration policies in the UK. "Scots are not represented at Westminster and I feel like Scottish political leaders have more integrity than those in Westminster or the US." By Georgina Rannard, UGC & social news	First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has announced that she is seeking a second referendum on Scottish independence to take place before Britain leaves the European Union.
The bird's head and wings became stuck in the wire fence in Bethesda while it was chasing a wood pigeon. RSPCA Inspector Mike Pugh, who freed the animal, said: "The buzzard was feisty, but luckily, had not had much feather damage. "I released the bird back to the wild where he belongs straight away."	A buzzard has been rescued after becoming trapped between fencing and a wall in Gwynedd.
Three operators have been shortlisted for the Northern Rail franchise and three for First TransPennine Express (TPE), with the winners due to be announced in October 2015. The Campaign for Better Transport and the RMT transport union are concerned rail services could be cut. But, rail minister Claire Perry promised a "world-class rail network". The franchises connect passengers travelling between the key strategic cities of Leeds, Liverpool, Sheffield, Manchester, Newcastle and Carlisle and onwards to Edinburgh and Glasgow. The companies competing for the Northern franchise are Arriva, Govia and Abellio, which has held the contract in a joint venture with Serco since 2004. The three shortlisted for TPE are FirstGroup, Keolis and Stagecoach. FirstGroup and Keolis currently operate TPE in a joint venture. The government said franchise bidders would need to improve customer service and passenger satisfaction on the two networks which carry more than 110 million passengers last year. Ms Perry said: "Building a railway that is fit for the 21st century is a vital part of our long-term economic plan, connecting businesses and communities, generating jobs and boosting growth." Over the next five years, more than Â£1bn will be spent on the rail network in the north, the government has said. This includes Â£600m for the Northern Hub project and electrification projects in the north-west and across the Trans-Pennine routes. The RMT held a protest outside Westminster on Monday opposing plans for the Northern and TPE franchises. Mick Cash, RMT acting general secretary, said: "This was just round one of the fight to stop the carve up of jobs and services on Northern and TransPennine Express."	The shortlist of companies bidding to run rail networks in the north of England has been announced.
Emmerson Whittel may need surgery on his jaw, while the club alleges player Josh Lynam was also bitten on the ear. The RFL's match review panel will look at official video on Thursday, as it does for all on-field incidents. Keighley have gathered additional video from spectators following an appeal. Footage already online, shot from the stands, shows a number of fights breaking out on the field between the two sets of players. Following the incident, Whittel posted on Twitter that brackets and bands had been used to try to re-align his jaw and that he faces at least three months out. Keighley Cougars of League One, England's third-tier competition, progressed to the Challenge Cup fourth round with a 50-32 win over Fryston Warriors - a side from the second tier of England's amateur game. The match, a "home" game for Fryston, was played at nearby Featherstone in West Yorkshire after the tie was at risk of being reversed and played at Keighley instead. Keighley have also complained to the RFL about their off-field treatment before kick-off, as they allege players and members of staff were refused entry to the ground without a valid matchday ticket. A statement on Keighley's website said: "The players' allocation of 'family and friends' tickets was then claimed to have been used to admit the playing squad and coaching staff into the ground. "The club is outraged by this development." The BBC contacted Fryston Warriors, who have declined to comment at this time.	Keighley want the Rugby Football League to consider amateur video footage when they review a brawl during the club's Challenge Cup tie against Fryston, which left a player with a broken jaw.
He told The Hollywood Reporter he was "super excited" and wanted "to put a different spin on it", but did not expand on what role he would play. The film will see Jordan reunite with his Creed director Ryan Coogler. "I'm looking forward to working with Ryan once again. It's gonna be a good time," he said. He added he could not wait to work with Nyong'o, who won a best supporting actress Oscar for 12 Years a Slave in 2014, as well as Chadwick Boseman - who is currently on the big screen playing Black Panther in Captain America: Civil War. Jordan played the Human Torch in last year's Fantastic Four flop reboot.  Nyong'o also played CGI character Maz Kanata in Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Black Panther will be released in February 2018.	Michael B Jordan has confirmed he and Oscar-winning actress Lupita Nyong'o will be among the cast of the upcoming Marvel superhero film Black Panther.
The 35-year-old threw a new F51 European record of 17.68m to score 1100 points and finish ahead of team-mates Josie Pearson and Gemma Prescott. It beat the previous best of 15.83 set by Ireland's Catherine O'Neill in 2001. "I'm throwing well at the moment and once I got the big throw, I knew the pressure was off," said Butterfield. The Glasgow-based newcomer, who was left paralysed by a tumour on her spinal cord in 2011,  took up athletics earlier this year via the talent identification programme Girls4Gold after playing wheelchair rugby for a couple of years. "Because I was already doing rugby and the strength and conditioning work with that, I just had to try to adapt that to athletics," she told BBC Sport. "I've loved it and trained hard but I know I have a lot more to learn. "Representing GB for the first time here has been a bit surreal but the team has been great and everyone has been really welcoming. "The difference sport has made to me is huge but I never dreamed I would be part of this so soon." Compatriot Pearson was frustrated after three of her six throws were deemed to be fouls. "There was a technical issue with my throws with an official saying I was breaking some of the rules," she said. "I've been throwing the same way all season and not been pulled up on it before so it is frustrating for this to happen at a major championship where I know I could have thrown further."	Debutant Jo Butterfield led a British clean sweep of the medals in the women's F32/51 club throw at the IPC Athletics European Championships.
Vale took a deserved lead when AJ Leitch-Smith converted Byron Moore's cross. Jamal Campbell-Ryce equalised just after half-time with a drilled finish and Sam Hird headed the hosts in front. JJ Hooper's curling shot brought the visitors level, but Gboly Ariyibi turned in a corner and O'Shea's 20-yard shot sealed the win. The win moved the Spireites up to 17th, five points clear of the relegation zone, while Port Vale dropped to 13th, 10 points adrift of the play-off places.	Chesterfield boosted their hopes of staying up with a comeback win to dent Port Vale's slender play-off hopes.
The UK stage of the race comes to the city on 7 July. Cycling enthusiast Rad Wagon is recruiting people to knit 3,000 miniature "Tour jerseys" and wool-covered bicycle wheels. Schools and knitting groups have already offered to start knitting and the council was "interested", he said. A similar "mini-jersey" idea is being promoted by Harrogate Borough Council for the Yorkshire stage of the race. The public response to that was so overwhelming the council had to ask people not to send any more knitting to them. "It's a bit copycat but we can do so much more," Mr Wagon said. "The city's well-known for its knitters and 'yarn bombers' who cover everything from bikes to trees to lamp-posts. It's 'very Cambridge'. "I think knitting is in Cambridge's DNA," he added. Mr Wagon, a cycling skills and bicycle maintenance trainer from Outspoken Training in the city, said he was a fan not only of the Tour de France, but the cultural activities surrounding it. "It isn't just a bike race. Its history is all about promoting your town and region and that's something we can do. "The world's eyes will be on us and it's a chance for us to show that Cambridge can do things slightly differently, and perhaps slightly oddly," he said. A knitting shop owner has offered to give knitting lessons and collect the tiny pullovers, Mr Wagon said. A cycle shop in the city has also offered a collection of battered wheels which Mr Wagon hopes can also be turned into knitted decorations. He said he was discussing suitable places his knitted bunting might go, with the city council.	A man who admits he "cannot knit a stitch" is hoping to cover the streets of Cambridge with knitted bunting and wool artwork during the Tour de France.

When Adidas, Gazprom, Hyundai-Kia, McDonald's, Budweiser, Coca-Cola and Visa signed their deals, they would have envisaged seeing their brands beamed into millions of households around the world. Pitch-side exposure at World Cup matches, accompanied by high-profile advertising campaigns, means that backing the World Cup guarantees getting your company promoted in all parts of the globe. However, having spent tens of millions of pounds to be associated with sporting excellence, those famous brands now find their name and products associated with the increasingly tarnished Fifa brand, arrests and allegations of "rampant, systemic, and deep-rooted corruption". A number of the sponsors - Coca-Cola, Kia, Adidas and Visa - have made known their concerns about what is happening at Fifa, with the latter particularly vociferous, warning that unless the global governing body makes "changes now", it would "reassess our sponsorship". And McDonald's said it "takes matters of ethics and corruption very seriously and the news from the US Department of Justice is extremely concerning. We are in contact with FIFA on this matter. We will continue to monitor the situation very closely". For the four years of the last "World Cup cycle", from 2011 to 2014, Fifa's six top tier Global Partners (as was - it is now five) paid a total of $177m (Â£116m) annually, which would mean each partner paid roughly $30m a year for this status. Tier one sponsor Sony decided not to renew its contract last year - it had been a Fifa partner since 2007, after signing a contract in 2005 worth $38m annually. One publicity-savvy bookmaker has offered odds on which sponsor will be the first to pull out of its association with football's Swiss-based powerbrokers. It has Visa as the favourites, followed by Hyundai-Kia, although none of Fifa's backers have said yet they are ending their deals. Russian gas firm Gazprom is bottom of the betting to leave, and indeed it has put out a statement saying the current situation will have "no influence" on its agreement. But as the scandal is not likely to go away any time soon, what damage is being done to these well-known companies, some of whom have associations with Fifa stretching back decades? "This is disastrous for the main core group of big Fifa sponsors. For them, this is a major issue," says Anastasia Kourovskaia, a brands expert at agency Millward Brown. "The idea of sponsorship is to transfer the goodwill that supporters feel for the sport, to the benefit of a brand's equity." She suggests that the big seven corporations may have to position themselves at arms-length from Fifa, if they do not want to be hit by the fall-out from the sensational developments. "The solution is to emphasise that they are supporting football for the benefit of the game itself, and the pleasure and challenge of winning and playing football, rather than Fifa as an organisation," she says. "They have to differentiate themselves from Fifa's management." In addition, she points out that as this is not the first scandal to hit Fifa, it might be a good time for the sponsors to form a committee of their own "to ensure the ethical running of big global football events". One other unforeseen outcome of the furore may be that in future, potential sports sponsors may look to back smaller, grass-roots, events - which traditionally have been more complex and costly to back - rather than global blockbusters such as World Cups, which have a greater potential for scandal. "This might be the tipping point that sees sponsors move away from events which are 'uniform' across the world, and towards more local events," she says. Adidas - the German sportswear firm has been supplying the official match ball for all Fifa World Cup tournament matches since 1970. Also involved in all other Fifa events, such as the Confederations Cup Brazil 2013, and the Fifa U-20 World Cups for women and men. Coca-Cola - the US soft drinks firm is one of the longest-standing corporate partners of Fifa, with a formal association since 1974 and an official sponsorship of the Fifa World Cup that began in 1978. Coca-Cola has had stadium advertising at every Fifa World Cup since 1950. Gazprom - the Russian energy giant signed up with Fifa in 2013 as a partner for all competitions in the period of 2015 to 2018, including the 2018 Fifa World Cup, which is due to take place in Russia for the first time. (The firm is also an official partner of the Uefa Champions League 2012 to 2015). Hyundai/Kia - the South Korean carmaker began its Fifa alliance in 1999, in a deal to sponsor 13 Fifa competitions including the 2002 World Cup, an agreement extended to the 2006 event. It again backed the 2010  World Cup and is now the official Automotive Partner of Fifa until 2022. Visa - the credit card company became a top-tier Fifa partner in 2007, taking over from rivals Mastercard in controversial circumstances, and recently extended its relationship until 2022.  It is a sponsor of five Fifa events this year, including the Women's World Cup in Canada. Budweiser - the US beverage has been a World Cup sponsor since the 1986 event in Mexico, and is the Official Beer of the tournament, with its product on sale in all stadiums at the finals, and it also sponsors the Man of the Match award at each game. McDonald's - the American fast food chain has been a sponsor since the 1994 World Cup in the US. Its products are available at all matches in the finals tournament, and it also sponsors the World Cup Player Escort programme, in which children accompany the teams onto the pitch. Meanwhile, it appears that Nike, which is not an official Fifa sponsor (but does come up with clever marketing campaigns around the World Cup) has also been dragged into the furore, with the US Department of Justice questioning its deal with the Brazilian Football Association. The American indictments state that an unidentified "major US sportswear company" is alleged to have been involved in the payment and receipt of bribes. The Department of Justice did not name the firm, but Nike and the Brazilian football federation have been partners since a $400m sponsorship deal was signed back in 1996. Nike did not confirm it was the company alluded to, but said it "believes in ethical and fair play in both business and sport and strongly opposes any form of manipulation or bribery. We have been co-operating, and will continue to co-operate, with the authorities." Meanwhile, the editor-in-chief of Dutch newspaper Nederlands Dagblad says he does not want to see any adverts from Fifa sponsors in his paper until they have "converted". And the sponsorship industry's trade body in Europe is taking a dim view of the arrests and indictments. The European Sponsorship Association says that the developments "underline the critical importance of transparency and high ethical standards in sport and in business". They said that sponsors did not want to be associated with alleged "shady practices" and were "increasingly asking rights-owners tough questions on a range of compliance and corporate social responsibility (CSR) issues".	It has not been an easy week for the big multinational corporations that sponsor football's world governing body Fifa.
Jordan Burrow tripped James Jennings in the Town box, and Parkin put the visitors ahead from the rebound after his penalty was saved by Sam Johnson. Frear made it 2-0 before the break when he fired in Keanu Marsh-Brown's cross. Darren Carter's shot hit the bar for Rovers in the second half, while Halifax struggled to create chances. Forest Green assistant Jamie Day told BBC Radio Gloucestershire: Media playback is not supported on this device "They were on a good run of games - 13 unbeaten - so we knew it was going to be a tough match, but I thought the boys dug in today and showed quality when needed and fully deserved the win. "The way Cheltenham are playing as well, we need to keep winning games. "We've had two really good runs during the course of the season and we want to keep it going."	Goals from Jon Parkin and Elliott Frear helped promotion-chasing Forest Green Rovers end Halifax Town's 13-match unbeaten run in the National League.
Jack Mackreth and Chris Holroyd both fired wide as the visitors pressed for an opener in the first half. Danny Rowe finally put the Silkmen ahead after the break with a deflected strike, and Mitch Hancox slotted in to make it 2-0 shortly after. Danny Whittaker's shot put the result beyond doubt, before Wrexham's Jordan White put a late penalty over the bar. The result lifts Macclesfield up to seventh in the table, seven points outside the play-off places, while Wrexham remain 15th. Match ends, Wrexham 0, Macclesfield Town 3. Second Half ends, Wrexham 0, Macclesfield Town 3. Curtis Tilt (Wrexham) is shown the yellow card. Goal!  Wrexham 0, Macclesfield Town 3. Danny Whitaker (Macclesfield Town).

Moseley Road Baths in Birmingham and Wentworth Woodhouse near Rotherham, Yorkshire, are listed on the 2016 World Monuments Watch. The list hails the pools as a "rare survival" and the mansion an "architectural masterpiece". Maintenance bills threaten both. Moseley Road Baths is the oldest of only three Grade II-listed swimming pools still in use in the UK. Owned by Birmingham City Council, the building is scheduled for closure in 2016. The Friends of Moseley Road Baths is campaigning for the repair and restoration of the complex so it can continues as an operational swimming pool. An estimated Â£42m needs to be spent on Wentworth Woodhouse to address structural damage, plasterwork falling from the ceilings and wet and dry rot taking hold in the historic interiors, said World Monument Watch. The Wentworth Woodhouse Preservation Trust's long-term vision proposes extensive public opening of the house and gardens and residential, business and events uses for various parts of the estate. John Darlington, executive director of World Monuments Fund Britain said: "Wentworth Woodhouse is an extraordinary building. Its enormous scale is matched by the historic importance of its interiors - representing a roll-call of great British craftsmen - and by the intriguing stories of politics, industry and social change that reverberate within." He added: "Moseley Road Baths is a rare survival: a public building that echoes the class and gender divisions of the early 20th century, but one that is still cherished by local communities today." The 2016 World Monument Watch list also includes the Kua Ruins in Tanzania - the remains of a medieval Swahili town at risk from the effects of a harsh climate and looters. Also on the list is Dalieh Raouche in Beruit, a coastal promenade that is the latest victim of a development frenzy that has destroyed many of the city's open spaces. And the near-forgotten remains of World War II concentration camps in Italy are listed as at risk.	An Edwardian swimming baths and an 18th century country mansion are among the most under-threat buildings in the world, according to a heritage group.
The first earthquake near Dingxi city had a magnitude of 5.98 and was shallow, with a depth of just 9.8 km (6 miles), the US Geological Survey said. Just over an hour later, a magnitude 5.6 quake hit the same area, it added. In 2008, an earthquake in Sichuan province left up to 90,000 people dead and millions homeless. A factory worker in Minxian county told AFP that he felt "violent shaking" and "ran to the yard of the [factory] plant immediately". "Our factory is only one floor. When I came to the yard, I saw an 18-storey building, the tallest in our county, shaking ferociously, especially the 18th floor," he said. The area has been hit by 371 aftershocks, according to the Earthquake Administration of Gansu province. Tremors were felt in the provincial capital, Lanzhou, and as far away as Xian, 400km (250 miles) to the east. At least 5,600 houses in the province's Zhangxian county are seriously damaged and 380 have collapsed, while some areas suffered from power cuts or mobile communications being disrupted, the earthquake administration added. "Many have been injured by collapsed houses," a doctor based in Minxian county was quoted by Reuters news agency as saying. "Many villagers have gone to local hospitals along the roads." The earthquake has caused a direct economic loss of 198 million yuan ($32m; Â£21m), the Dingxi government said on its microblog. Both the Chinese President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang had called Gansu province to express their concern for the victims and stress the importance of the rescue operations being conducted well, the Dingxi government added. Crews of fire fighters and rescue dogs have already arrived at the scene, the BBC's Celia Hatton in Beijing reports. In pictures: Quakes aftermath The closer to the surface an earthquake strikes, the more damage it can cause, our correspondent adds. The earthquake reportedly triggered a series of mudslides and landslides, making it difficult for rescuers to access some areas hit by the quake. The Gansu military police have deployed 500 soldiers, including 120 specialist rescuers, while 500 emergency tents and 2,000 quilts are also being transported to affected areas, Xinhua added. Officials from the civil affairs, transportation and earthquake departments were also visiting local towns to assess the damage, a statement on the Dingxi party website said. Rain is expected in the region later, leading to fears that this will make rescue efforts more difficult, or cause more landslides. "Showery weather is expected tomorrow, and lighter rain the day after that. The rain may have an adverse effect on rescue efforts - please pay attention and be on guard!" the Dingxi government wrote on its microblog. Residents in towns near the earthquake also reported feeling the tremors. "You could see the chandeliers wobble and the windows vibrating and making noise, but there aren't any cracks in the walls," AP news agency quoted a clerk at Wuyang Hotel, about 40 km (25 miles) from the epicentre, as saying. "Shop assistants all poured out onto the streets when the shaking began," the clerk said.	Two powerful earthquakes have struck China's north-west Gansu province, killing at least 75 people and leaving more than 400 others injured.
Hasbro, the maker of My Little Pony, approached Mattel about a deal late last year, according to Bloomberg news. The combination of the two toy-makers would produce a company with a $20bn market capitalization as of Wednesday. In 1996, Mattel made a $5.2bn (Â£3.5bn) offer to buy Hasbro, but the two sides failed to reach a final agreement. Over the last few years, Mattel has lost market share to Hasbro and Denmark's Lego. Lego overtook Mattel as the world's largest toy-marker in 2014. In its most recent quarter, Mattel reported a 4% drop in worldwide sales and expects sales to decline this year. That is partly because Hasbro has taken over the contract to produce toys based on the Disney movie Frozen, and toys sold under the Princess brand. Mattel estimated in 2014 that the Princess brand brought in $300m. In an effort to boost sales of its Barbie line, Mattel introduced three new body types and seven new skin tones in January. Sales of Barbie dolls fell 10% globally in 2015. Neither company has commented on the rumoured deal. Hasbro's share price rose 1.5%. In afternoon trading, Mattel shares fell back and were trading up 1.6% on the day. Hasbro reports its full-year earnings report on 8 February.	Shares in Mattel, the maker of Barbie dolls, jumped 8% on Thursday following a report it had discussed a merger with rival Hasbro.
I cannot see these women but I hear them fighting to reach the mobile phone that belongs to the inmate that I am on the phone with. Thangavelu Sarojini, a young Tamil woman, says she was tortured by her employer. "I still have wounds and scars in my hands, neck, legs. They beat me, pinched me and burnt me," she says from the Olaya detention camp where hundreds of migrant women from south and southeast Asia are held. Their crime, they say, was running away from employers to escape physical, sexual or psychological abuse. They are all now classified as illegal immigrants under Saudi law. "I was not paid for one-and-a-half years, they tried to kill me, then I fled to the embassy," Sarojini tells me. Hundreds of thousands of Sri Lankan women arrive in the Middle East every year and they are a major foreign revenue earner for the island.  But many claim to be ill-treated, tortured, or not paid for the work. In one notorious case in August 2010, 24 nails were removed from the body of LP Ariyawathie, a 49-year-old Sri Lankan domestic worker in Saudi.  Saudi authorities have pledged to investigate her case but there has been no reported progress in the investigation. But it is not only physical abuse that forced these hapless women to flee their employers. Kusuma Nandani, a mother-of-two who has not returned to Sri Lanka since 1993, says she was not paid by her employer for at least 15 years. She says that she suffered stress and depression because her employers did not allow her to keep in touch with her husband, son and daughter in Sri Lanka. As Kusuma Nandani cannot read or write, she was was only able to write a few letters - and then only with the help of other Sri Lankans. One day, she was told by the employer that she would not be paid anymore after she forgot to hand over pocket money to the children before dropping them off at school. From then, she says she was imprisoned by her employers for more than a decade. Rescued by the Sri Lankan embassy officials in Riyadh in 2009 after a tip-off, she has been a detainee at the camp since then. Her daughter says she is puzzled as to why the Sri Lankan embassy authorities have not been able to send her mother home even though Kusuma was granted an exit visa some time ago. WG Mala Mangalika is another maid who fled alleged ill-treatment. She says she was told to work without pay for more than a year because her employer paid a Sri Lankan agency nearly 7,000 riyal ($1,866). Now she is facing a lawsuit filed by the employer. "The employer says he has paid to the agency for four years so he would not allow me to go back," says Mala Mangalika. Detention centre inmates say that although Sri Lankan officials helped when they first arrived at the embassy, they are concerned about the delay in sending them back home. Apart from those in the camp, hundreds more abused maids are currently staying in an embassy hostel. Their plight is worsened because they become illegal immigrants as soon as they leave their employers, the legal "sponsor" for their work permits. Human Rights Watch (HRW) has long been campaigning for more protection for domestic workers in the Middle East and has called for migrant domestic workers to be included into local labour laws so that they are better protected. "My legs are still swollen and blackened after I fell from upstairs," Mala Senananayake weeps as she grabs the phone from others in the queue in Olaya camp, in Saudi Arabia. "I have no one in Sri Lanka. My parents are gone, my husband is trying to divorce me, I have only daughter who doesn't know who to approach to get help." "Please sir, please help me to go back to Sri Lanka," she repeatedly begs me. The labour officer at the Sri Lankan embassy in Riyadh told the BBC that the files of the detainees at Olaya camp have been transferred to the Sri Lanka Foreign Employment Bureau (SLFEB) in Colombo. But SLFEB head Kingsley Ranawaka did not answer repeated telephone calls to get a response. In an open letter to the governments of Saudi Arabia, Indonesia and Sri Lanka, HRW urged them to  "ensure a timely and comprehensive response" to alleged abuse and implement "systemic reforms to prevent such abuses in future". It has urged Saudi Arabia to "prosecute alleged perpetrators, allow victims to return to their home countries before the trial and seek both criminal penalties and financial compensation". It also wants the cancellation of the Kafala system that requires the consent of the employer to repatriate migrant workers. The BBC has had no response from the media office of the embassy of Saudi Arabia in London.	"Please, sir... help us to go back to Sri Lanka," one woman after another cries and pleads over the phone from a detention centre in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
In particular, she likes fancy china and plates, and is happy to show off her latest purchase. She ordered a platter online, and took it out of the bubble wrap excitedly. She bought that item, and some more china, toiletries and a bike, on a cashback website so she is expecting about £14 to be paid back to her. But Ms Sen might have to be patient. It will take up to four months for her to be paid. Cashback sites are a simple idea. Instead of going directly to a shop, you access a retailer's online store through a link from a cashback website. You still receive your item directly from the retailer, but you also get some money from the cashback website. It is often a percentage of the total price you paid. The sites have links to retailers of everything from groceries and toiletries, to insurance policies and broadband deals. But Ms Sen has not actually had any money back yet. "I thought it was going to be as easy as one-two-three, just make the purchase to the website and get the cash back the next day," she said. "But that didn't happen. It's been well over a month and I'm still waiting for it." Ms Sen thinks the website is not clear enough about how long that wait will be. "I have no idea how long it's going to take me to get the cash back," she said. She went through one of the biggest cashback sites, Quidco. It says it has more than 2 million members in the UK, and that the average user can make £262 a year. That is small change for its more committed users. Quidco says more than a hundred of them have made over £10,000. But, like all cashback websites, its customers can face long waits for their money to start coming in. Andy Oldham is the company's managing director and said every attempt is made to be clear and transparent. "That's the whole ethos of the site," he said. "On every single merchant page, we've got statistics that show the time it takes for those transactions to be paid out." For example, with the bike Ms Sen bought, the information about the length of time is displayed underneath the deal. We pointed this out to Ms Sen, who said she had never noticed the warning before. She thinks that four months is too long to wait for her money. "It's right down the bottom of the page," she said. "Look how light the shade of the font is. It's just not prominent enough. They need to make it clearer," she added. Despite all this, she says she will carry on using cashback websites. "My attitude is, it's better than getting no money back at all," she said. Quidco's Andy Oldham said he would take Ms Sen's feedback on board. He admitted there was "quite possibly" an argument for rethinking how this information is shown on the website. Mr Oldham maintains that it is impossible to give an average waiting time, because it depends on different retailers and products. So, if you are buying something like food, that will be consumed quickly, you should be paid relatively quickly. On the other hand, if you book a holiday six months in advance, you will not be paid until after you come home. Mr Oldham says it was important that customers realised that cashback arrangements do not pay out immediately. "We're very much dependent on the retailer paying us the advertising commission before we pay it back to the consumer," he pointed out. Another site, TopCashBack, says it works hard to manage consumers' expectations about how long it takes to get their money. But on average, those customers may have to wait 12 weeks for their money to clear into their accounts. There are other things to be aware of if you sign up to a cashback website. Some, like Quidco, charge an annual fee while others take a cut out of your commission. Personal finance expert Sarah Pennells, from the website Savvywoman, says there are dozens of sites to pick from, so it is important to shop around to find the best one for you. "The first thing is to look at how much cash you're going to get back on the various deals and secondly, look at how they're going to pay you," she said. "Some pay by cheque, others by bank transfer, some ask you to set up a PayPal account. "The last thing, and possibly most important thing, is don't just focus on the cashback deal. It's got to be the right deal or buy in the first place," she added.	Swagata Sen likes her home to look good.
Kevin Whyman, 39, was killed in the crash at Oulton Park, Cheshire, at about 14:00 BST on Saturday. But TV and radio presenter Chris Evans, who created the event, said police had advised it would be best to carry on. A minute's silence has been held at the festival site and visitors stopped to pay their respects. Mr Evans said the crash in which Mr Whyman was killed was a "tragic accident". A visibly upset Evans told reporters: "Our condolences go out to his family, who have been informed. "The police have also advised us that the best thing and the safest thing to do is to carry on with the event, bearing in mind that there are 10,000 children here - and that is what we are going to do." CarFest organisers said the festival had resumed but there would be no further aerial displays. Mr Whyman, nicknamed "Jester", was a member of the Gnat Display Team and married with a young daughter. In a statement, Heritage Aircraft Trust, which runs the team, said: "Kevin was a Royal Air Force-trained fast jet pilot whose enthusiasm for flying the Folland Gnat was infectious. "He will be greatly missed by his family, the team and many friends. "Kevin leaves a wife and young daughter. Please respect the privacy of family members and of the team at this most difficult time." Shocked spectators fell silent as the plane suddenly nosedived during the display, before disappearing behind trees. Moments later a plume of thick black smoke billowed in to the sky. BBC producer Justin Bones, at the scene, said two planes had performed a low-level, close-proximity pass just before the crash. One of the aircraft had failed to pull up and crashed north of the circuit, he said. Mr Whyman, who started flying the Folland Gnat in 2005, was one of the founder members of the display team in 2007. He lived in Westminster, central London, and split his leisure time between the airfield during the summer months and the ski slopes of the Swiss Alps during the winter. An Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) spokesman said it would be investigating the incident and sending a team to the site. Cheshire Police is also investigating. Mr Whyman, who was born in Chester, was a Cambridge University economics graduate. He trained with the university's boat club and coxed Cambridge to victory in the 1996 and 1997 boat races against Oxford. He had a career with the RAF from 1998 to 2001, when he left for a trading job with a US investment bank in the City of London. He completed his civilian flying licences so that he could continue to fly. Evans is a car enthusiast and was recently named as the new presenter of the BBC's Top Gear show. CarFest is described on its Twitter profile as his "dream of the perfect family festival", featuring cars, planes and music while raising money for BBC Children In Need. The weekend event in Cheshire began on Friday and a second festival is due to be held in Hampshire later this month.	The CarFest motoring event has resumed, a day after the death of a pilot whose aircraft plummeted from the sky during an aerial display.
Four-month-old Eli Cox was found at an address in Lapwing Close in Minster, Sheppey, on 13 April and died in hospital on 27 April, Kent Police said. Katherine Cox, 32, and Danny Shepherd, 25, both of Millfield Road, Faversham, appeared at Medway Magistrates' Court on Tuesday. Both were released on conditional bail. Ms Cox and Mr Shepherd are also accused of one count of causing or allowing serious injury to a child and one count of possession of a class B drug (amphetamine). They are due to appear at Maidstone Crown Court on 13 December.	A man and a woman have appeared in court charged with causing or allowing the death of a baby.
But thanks to the controversy around gifts to David Cameron from his mother, IHT is now under the political spotlight. Just 40,100 families - that's around 8% of estates - will pay any IHT at all in 2016/17, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). Thanks to rising house prices, that number is set to rise over the next few years, but much more slowly than was originally expected. That's because the chancellor, George Osborne, has finally been able to make changes to IHT - changes that were blocked by the Liberal Democrats during the years of coalition government. So how does IHT work - and what reforms are already in the pipeline? If you pass on property, or anything else of monetary value, to your descendants, you will pay IHT, but only if the total value exceeds £325,000 in 2016/17. Anything above that amount will incur tax at 40%. Since married or civil partners can transfer assets free of tax between each other, one partner automatically inherits the other's allowance. So in practice, the IHT allowance is often doubled to £650,000. In other words, if a father passes wealth to a mother, who subsequently also dies, she can pass on up to £650,000 without having to pay IHT. From April 2017, the government will introduce a new Transferable Main Residence Allowance (TMRA), to help people pass on property to their descendants. Initially this will be set at £100,000, rising to £175,000 by 2020/21. When added to the IHT threshold of £325,000, it will allow each individual to pass on £425,000 with no tax payable - or £850,000 per couple. By 2021, the tax-free limit will be £500,000 each, or £1m for married or civil partners. Further details of TMRA can be found here Even if a parent sets up a trust in favour of a child, inheritance tax is still payable. In most cases, IHT will be charged at 20% on money or property when it goes into the trust, if it exceeds the IHT allowance. If the parent dies within seven years, an additional 20% is charged, to equal the 40% non-trust rate. In addition, assets within a trust are usually re-assessed every ten years, to take account of changing property valuations, for example. Under the existing rules, you can pass on money, property or possessions without paying any tax, as long as you survive for seven years after giving it to the recipient. If you die within the seven year period, and you gift more than the allowance, a taper system exists. If you die six years after making the gift, for example, you will only pay 8% IHT. See table below. In addition you can give up to £250 a year to as many people as you like without paying tax. Usually it is the estate which is liable for IHT. However if you are the recipient of a gift, and the giver has died within 7 years, and has already given away more than £325,000, you could be liable to pay IHT yourself. More details on gifts Anyone can give away up to £3,000 a year, and pay no tax. This is known as the annual exemption. If unused, this allowance can be carried over to the following year, up to a maximum of £6,000. In addition, if you can show that the gift was funded out of income - as opposed to savings - you will not pay IHT. But you may have to prove that the living standards of the deceased person were not reduced as a result. The rules around wedding - or civil partnership - gifts are different again. Providing the gifts are made at the time of the wedding, there are allowances as follows:	Very few people pay inheritance tax (IHT) and it raises relatively little money for the Treasury.
Mark Piper is jointly charged with murdering Levi Blu. Levi died in 2013 of internal bleeding. His mother Danielle Cassin is also accused of murder. A woman told a jury at Birmingham Crown Court she saw Mr Piper being violent with his other child, who was five at the time, in 2012. The incident happened in the living room of Mr Piper's Chelmsley Wood home after he banned the youngster from playing on a games console, she said. The witness said Mr Piper swore at his son and dragged him out the room before poking and prodding him in the face by the stairs. "He (the child) was crying," said the woman, who met 31-year-old Mr Piper through a mutual friend. "He punched him in his stomach at the same time on the stairs. It was hard, enough to hurt him. "I have never seen anyone hitting a kid like that. It was rough. It was how you would hit your friends messing about. The little boy was crying. He was really upset." But Paul Lewis QC, defending Mr Piper, wanted to know why the punch was not mentioned in her original police statement. "I was lying (to the police)," she said. "I didn't want to seem like a grass." Mr Lewis questioned how she could be sure about the words Mr Piper had used when she made her police statement months after the incident. He highlighted a message sent by the witness about Piper which said: "He loves all his kids and looks after them well. I just don't understand all this." Levi was found at the flat his parents shared in Nightingale Avenue, Chelmsley Wood, on 20 February 2013. Both Ms Cassin, 27, of Frensham Close, Chelmsley Wood, and Mr Piper, of no fixed abode, deny murder. They also deny causing or allowing the death of Levi and causing him suffering. The trial continues.	A man accused of murdering his 22-month-old son in Birmingham had previously punched his other son in the stomach, a court heard.
Rachid Lamrabet, 42, who lives in London, denies sexually assaulting a 25-year-old man at Greyfriars Kirk, on 26 August 2015. The judge said the case was being deserted after a matter arose and he heard legal submissions. He added that there were "good reasons" for the move. The trial had only just begun at the High Court in Livingston on Monday. Dismissing the jury members, judge Lord Woolman told them: "In the light of submissions made to me I regret that I'm going to discharge you as a jury and continue this case until tomorrow. "I'm not in a position to tell you the exact reasons for that all I can tell you is that there are very good reasons. "I very much regret that this has happened, but sometimes matters occur which are outwith our control. "I regret and I'm sorry for any inconvenience caused to you." Mr Lamrabet, is accused of engaging in consensual sexual activity with his alleged victim but ignored him when he was told to stop. The charge states that he seized the younger man by the body, pushed him to the ground and raped him to his injury. English is not the accused's native language, and a Spanish interpreter sat with him in the dock so he could understand the proceedings.	The case of a man accused of a homosexual rape in an Edinburgh graveyard has been deserted and will restart with a fresh jury.
Barry Joy, 56 and Daniel Timbers, 28, died in a "fierce fire" following an explosion at digger bucket maker Harford Attachments in Norwich in 2015. The coroner said Mr Timbers had been standing in for his father who was ill. Post-mortem examinations said the men died as a result of the effects of fire and inhalation of fumes of combustion. The inquest was told staff heard a "loud noise" at about 09:00 BST on 13 July 2015. "Staff evacuated the premises, with some of them bravely trying to rescue Mr Timbers and Mr Joy," coroner Yvonne Blake told the Norwich inquest. She added, "Their bodies were recovered from the booth afterwards." Paint sprayer Mr Joy, of Spencer Street, Norwich and production operative Daniel Timbers, of Dereham Road, Norwich, were working in one of two booths bought from RAF Lyneham in Wiltshire when the base was closed down. Kenneth Stedman, managing director of Ipswich-based Industrial Powder and Paint Services, advised Harford Attachments on the transaction. The inquest heard the two units were "well kept for their age" and he advised the company that they would be suitable to be set up as they were on the airbase. The coroner said the jury inquest, which is continuing, would hear evidence about training of staff, policies on site and extraction equipment on the paint-spraying booths.	Two men who died in a paint-spraying booth were so badly burned they could only be identified using their dental records, an inquest has heard.
The men tried to take their own lives to protest against last week's assault on four Dalit men allegedly by the members of a Hindu hardline group. The Dalit men were assaulted while trying to skin a dead cow. Many Hindus consider cows sacred and the slaughter of the animal is banned in many Indian states. Last year, a Muslim man was lynched by a violent mob that attacked his house over allegations that his family had been storing and consuming beef at home. There have several other attacks across India where Muslim men have been accused of eating or smuggling beef. Protesters set government buses on fire on Gondal, Dhoraji and Junagadh highway on Monday and blocked a national highway and seven men allegedly took poison at separate protest rallies by Dalit groups, police said. A senior police official told BBC Hindi that a large number of policemen have been deployed in the region and the situation is under control. Last week, four Dalit men, believed to be tannery workers, were stripped and beaten with sticks by men claiming to be "cow protectors". After a video of the assault was released on the internet, eight attackers were identified and arrested. The victims are reported to be severely wounded and are recovering in hospital. Gujarat Chief Minister Anandiben Patel has said that her government was committed to protecting the Dalits and ordered an inquiry into the incident. Four policemen have been suspended.	Tension has gripped parts of the Indian state of Gujarat after reports that seven men from the low-caste Dalit community had attempted suicide.
The Celtic captain was unable to exert his influence as Rangers reached the Scottish Cup final on penalties. "I would look at Andy Halliday," said Ferguson when considering the key moments. "I thought he was exceptional. "Scott Brown is a fiery character and I think Andy met fire with fire and he matched him in that department." Brown missed an excellent first-half chance before Rangers went ahead and the Celtic skipper was also unsuccessful from the spot in the shoot-out after the match finished 2-2 at the end of extra-time. "I think Andy's quality on the day outshone Scott and he is getting a lot of stick," Ferguson told BBC Scotland. "He is the captain, you expect him to play. Whether he had an off day or not, I think probably Scott's role in the team is to get other players playing, but unfortunately for himself he didn't play particularly well. "But there were reasons for that and the reasons were Andy Halliday." Rangers were ahead twice, first through Kenny Miller and then from a stunning strike from winger Barrie McKay, who was voted the sponsor's man of the match. Erik Sviatchenko and later Tom Rogic levelled for Celtic. However, it was 24-year-old former Livingston, Middlesbrough and Bradford City midfielder Halliday who caught Ferguson's eye most. "Barrie McKay is getting a lot of plaudits - it was a wonderful goal - but for me, in that engine room, it was Andy Halliday," said Ferguson. "I thought he was phenomenal. A lot of people are making remarks about how much he was like my brother, Barry. "He is a Rangers man and you could see that throughout the game. "He played with a lot of aggression - but a lot of quality - and he drove Rangers on." Rangers have already won the Championship title and promotion, but Ferguson thought that manager Mark Warbuton would need to strengthen his squad during the summer in order to compete with Celtic in the top flight. "I think he's got a great philosophy in terms of the way he wants to play and, if he can add some quality players to that philosophy, I think Rangers could be a force next season," he said. Ferguson's fellow former Rangers midfielder, Stuart McCall, who had a spell as manager last season, agreed. "Obviously, Celtic will look to their side and look to strengthen, Rangers will be strengthening and maybe Hearts and Aberdeen too," he said. "All in all, it will be a fantastic Premiership next season and there will be teams who will think they can go ahead, but there is a long way to go. "Celtic will look back at chances that went begging and they hit the woodwork a couple of times, but I think Rangers can look forward now to a very good end to the season."	Andy Halliday's domination of Scott Brown in midfield was the key to Rangers' victory over Celtic, according to former Ibrox player Derek Ferguson.
Official data showed the US economy added 209,000 jobs last month, beating analysts' expectations, while the unemployment rate fell to 4.3%. The Dow Jones closed at a record for the eighth consecutive day, rising 0.3% to 22,092.81. The wider S&P 500 index closed up 0.19% at 2,476.83, while the Nasdaq rose 0.18% to 6,351.56. Analysts said the latest jobs report meant the Federal Reserve was still on track to raise interest rates later this year, which would be the third increase in 2017. Shares of banks, which benefit from higher rates, saw some of the most significant gains on Friday. Goldman Sachs was among the biggest winners on the Dow, rising 2.6%. Among individual stocks, Viacom shares sank nearly 14% after it forecast a drop in sales to US pay-TV companies and streaming services in the current quarter. Consumer review website operator Yelp saw its shares jump by more than a quarter after it announced the sale of its Eat24 business to Grubhub for $287.5m. Yelp also reported revenues of $209m for the second quarter of the year, which beat analysts' expectations. US stocks are in record territory this year. The Nasdaq is up almost 17% since January. The Dow has risen 11% and the S&P 500 is climbed almost 10%.	Stronger than expected jobs figures helped to lift US stocks on Friday, leading the Dow to another record.
The party won 33 seats on Thanet District Council, Kent, in May, making it the first authority in the UK to have a UKIP majority. UKIP councillor Jeff Elenor announced on Tuesday he was defecting to join the Democratic Independent Group. He joins four other UKIP councillors who defected last month saying they were unhappy with the council's lack of action over Manston Airport. They also said they were unhappy about what they felt was insufficient focus by the council on issues such as housing, mental health and disabilities. Mr Elenor said he did not feel the council was fulfilling its election pledge on Manston. In May, UKIP won 33 seats, the Conservatives 18, Labour four, and independents one - 29 seats were needed for a majority. UKIP now has 28 members, but remains the largest party on the council. Earlier this week, the US company seeking to purchase and reopen Manston Airport accused the council leader of holding up the process. The airport closed in May 2014 and was sold to a private consortium that plans to build homes on the site. RiverOak said it had offered the money to help with a compulsory purchase order (CPO), and in an email to the council leader, it accused Chris Wells of "throwing one road block after another in front of us in order for you to carry out whatever your real agenda might be". "Whatever it is, that agenda does not appear to recognise the will of your constituents, which is that Manston Airport be opened and operating at the earliest possible moment," chief investment officer George Yerall said. Mr Wells said the council was seeking further assurances that RiverOak could afford to purchase the site. The matter is due to be formally discussed at a cabinet meeting later this month.	The UK Independence Party has lost overall control of its only council.
Emergency services were called at 11:44 BST to reports a boat carrying a father, his teenage daughter and her two friends had capsized. Torbay inshore and all-weather lifeboats were called and the four were taken to Torbay hospital. The coastguard search and rescue teams from Berry Head and Torbay and the coastguard helicopter were also called. Specialist divers are at the scene and are expected to remove the capsized boat from near the entrance to the harbour. Mark Criddle, coxswain of Torbay's RNLI lifeboat, said the vessel was launched at 11:51 BST to reports of an overturned boat just outside Brixham harbour with four people in the water. 'We arrived on scene to find a 16ft speedboat upside down with a girl trapped in it," he said. "We located the girl and brought her onboard the lifeboat where she was immediately given first aid by a doctor and paramedic who were members of the lifeboat crew." He said the three other people who had been on the speedboat had been rescued by other craft in the area, including two jet skiers and a yacht. 'We took the girl back to shore where she was handed into the care of paramedics who took her to hospital. The three other people who had been aboard the overturned speedboat were also taken to hospital after being treated at the lifeboat station."	One person died and three others were taken to hospital after a boat capsized in Brixham harbour in south Devon.
The Columba Declaration commits the Churches to "grow together in communion and to strengthen their partnership in mission". Founded in two different branches of Protestantism, England's Church is Anglican and Scotland's Presbyterian. The two Churches will be debating the report over the coming months. The Church of England's General Synod will hold a debate in February and the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland will consider the report in May. The Columba Declaration appears within the Growth in Communion, Partnership in Mission report, which sets out the history of partnership between the two Churches and their shared beliefs. The report states: "The new arrangements we are proposing are modest and 'light touch' with a small contact group meeting yearly and reporting to the ecumenical bodies within each Church." The declaration has been authored by Kirk minister the Reverend John McPake, and the Church of England's Bishop of Chester, Peter Forster. They say the agreement will allow clergy and lay people from each Church to be welcomed into the other when they move across the border. The pact also recognises that the two Churches have constitutional responsibilities in separate parts of the UK. Rev Alison McDonald, convener of the Church of Scotland's ecumenical relations committee, said: "The joint report sets out clearly the shared foundations of faith of the Church of England and the Church of Scotland, which enable us to recognise one another formally for the first time. "This provides a sound basis for our ongoing co-operation and for exploring future partnership." The Reverend Dr Jeremy Worthern, Church of England secretary for ecumenical relations and theology, said the Church valued its "ecumenical relationship with the Church of Scotland and our relationship within the Anglican Communion with the Scottish Episcopal Church". He added: "There are opportunities for deepening both relationships as this report continues to be discussed and received by the Churches."	A report proposing an agreement between the Church of England and the Church of Scotland has been published, ahead of a debate by the Churches' ruling bodies.
The 85-year-old F1 supremo likened the sport to a rock concert at which the band turned up but could not perform. "We are not putting on a very good show," he said, in the build-up to Sunday's Bahrain Grand Prix. "Imagine if people turned up to watch the Rolling Stones and Mick (Jagger) couldn't sing and the others couldn't play their instruments." In a wide-ranging interview with BBC Sport, Ecclestone also: Last week, the drivers wrote an open letter saying the decision-making process in F1 is "obsolete and ill-structured". Responding the following day, Ecclestone said he agreed with the drivers. But he told BBC Sport he thought the drivers were saying "probably what their teams had told them to say". Alex Wurz, the chairman of the Grand Prix Drivers' Association, was not immediately available to respond to Ecclestone's claims. Ecclestone added the governance of F1 was "nothing to do with me". On the issue of qualifying, Ecclestone blamed governing body the FIA for the new format, which was supposed to spice up race weekends. It did the opposite at the season-opening race in Australia, prompting teams to call for a return to the 2015 system. However, the move was blocked by FIA president Jean Todt. Asked if the new qualifying system worked, Ecclestone said: "Depends how you looked at it. The whole idea is we were hoping one or two of the hot shoes would be in trouble in Q1 and Q2. It didn't happen." He added the idea "wasn't mine at all" but the FIA's. However, he rejected calls for a return to the 2015 format because he felt that did not work well either. There will be a meeting of team bosses on Sunday before the race in Bahrain to discuss the qualifying system again. Ecclestone has said he would like to switch to a different system that either decides the grid by ballot or shuffles the order by adding "time ballast" to drivers' times based on either the result of the previous race or the championship order. Ecclestone also discussed the new fuel-efficient turbo hybrid engines, arguing he would prefer a return to the naturally aspirated V8s in use until 2013. "I said this engine would be a disaster and was criticised for that," he said, claiming the lack of noise meant F1 had lost some of its appeal. He also claimed only one engine manufacturer - Mercedes - managed to adapt well to the new engines, which meant competition had suffered. Mercedes have dominated F1 since the new engine came in, winning both the drivers' and constructors championships for the past two years. "Mercedes have done an incredible job with that power unit," he said. "It is unbelievable.  but it is not F1." Asked what F1 should be like, he said: "Like it used to be. I didn't find anything wrong with the V8s and neither did anyone else."	Bernie Ecclestone says Formula 1 is "cheating" its fans because the quality of the show is poor.
The unrest began when drivers erected barricades in a protest against harassment and roadblocks by police demanding bribes. When security forced stepped in, some local residents joined the protesters and threw stones at police. Some demonstrators are reported to have been beaten up. Thirty people have been arrested. Africa Live: More on this and other news stories Zimbabwe has become increasing volatile in recent weeks with frequent protests against economic hardship and alleged government corruption. Police say they have reduced the number of roadblocks following complaints. The economy has struggled since a government programme seized most white-owned farms in 2000, causing exports to tumble. Robert Mugabe, 92, has been in power since independence in 1980. Critics accuse him of using violence and rigging during recent elections - allegations he denies. Official statistics say most citizens live on just one dollar a day.	Police in Zimbabwe's capital, Harare, have used tear gas and water cannons to break up a protest by minibus drivers.
The holders won eight straight races to triumph 9-8 after being docked two points for cheating in the build-up. Oracle surged to victory by 44 seconds to retain the Cup they won in 2010. The Kiwis won four of the first five races, making Oracle modify their boat and call Ainslie from the warm-up crew. The British sailing legend, 36, a four-time Olympic champion, was drafted in as tactician in place of American veteran John Kostecki and was instrumental in the US outfit's resurgence. "It's been one of the most amazing comebacks ever, I think, almost in any sport but certainly in sailing and to be a part of that is a huge privilege," said Ainslie. Ainslie combined superbly with Oracle's Australian skipper James Spithill and strategist Tom Slingsby, another Australian who won Laser gold at London 2012, to drag the syndicate back from the brink in the most remarkable turnaround in the event's 162-year history. "To be perfectly honest, we had a mountain to climb," Ainslie added. "We knew we had to sort ourselves out. We had to get the boat going faster. We did that. "The designers did a great job and we had to start sailing better. We got the momentum going and we started believing in ourselves. When you do that, you can become quite strong. " The New Zealanders, with impressive early pace upwind and slicker boat handling, opened up a seven-point lead (six to minus one) as Oracle's crew and equipment changes took effect. Media playback is not supported on this device But the US outfit, bankrolled by software billionaire Larry Ellison, were soon up to speed and won 10 of the next 12 races to lift the oldest trophy in international sport, known affectionately as the "Auld Mug". The Kiwis, led by skipper Dean Barker, came within two minutes of glory in race 13 in uncharacteristic light winds before organisers abandoned the race because the 40-minute time limit had elapsed. In the decider in fresh breeze and sunshine on San Francisco Bay, Team New Zealand edged a tight start and beat Oracle to the first mark. The Kiwis stayed clear around the second mark but lost the lead to the Americans early on the upwind leg. After briefly retaking the advantage, the Kiwis then watched as Oracle stormed ahead with remarkable upwind pace and remained clear for a comfortable win. I'm incredibly proud of our team and what they've achieved but I'm gutted we didn't get the last win we needed "What a race," said Spithill, 34, after only the third winner-takes-all final in the event's history. "It had everything. Man, these guys just showed so much heart. "On your own, you're nothing, but a team like this can make you look great. We were facing the barrel of a gun at 8-1 and the guys didn't even flinch. Thanks to San Francisco, this is one hell of a day." Barker, 41, said: "It's obviously very hard to fathom. We went out there to give it our absolute best shot. We felt we didn't leave anything on the table. It's very hard to swallow. The gains they've made are phenomenal. "I'm incredibly proud of our team and what they've achieved, but I'm gutted we didn't get the last win we needed to take the Cup back to New Zealand." As winners, Oracle will decide on the format, venue and timing of the 35th America's Cup. The US syndicate first won the Cup in 2010, when they beat holders Alinghi of Switzerland in a one-off match in huge multihulls following protracted legal wrangling. Ellison and Oracle Team USA boss Russell Coutts, who won the Cup for New Zealand in 1995 and 2000 before defecting to Alinghi for 2003, devised a new concept for the 2013 competition. They opted for revolutionary 72ft catamarans with rigid wing sails - and foiling daggerboards later pioneered by the Kiwis - which allowed the boats to reach startling speeds of more than 50mph. Races were brought inshore to make it more accessible for fans, while cutting-edge TV production with on-screen graphics were introduced to make it more appealing for a new audience of TV viewers. But the format was controversial and designs untested, with critics fearing for the safety of sailors. Oracle capsized last year, but it was the death of British Olympian Andrew Simpson in a training accident in May that prompted wide-ranging safety measures, including upper wind-speed limits and personal breathing apparatus. Critics also pointed to spiralling costs, with only three teams - Artemis Racing of Sweden, Emirates Team New Zealand and Luna Rossa Challenge of Italy - emerging to compete in the Louis Vuitton Cup challenger series for the right to take on Oracle. Artemis were unable to mount a meaningful campaign after Simpson's death, as Team New Zealand outclassed Luna Rossa in a one-sided Louis Vuitton Cup final. But despite Team New Zealand's early stranglehold and a number of races postponed because of unfavourable winds, the America's Cup showed that match-racing in giant catamarans can be hugely exciting and is likely to be the future of the event.	Sir Ben Ainslie's Oracle Team USA sealed one of sport's greatest comebacks when they overhauled an 8-1 deficit to beat Team New Zealand in the America's Cup decider in San Francisco.
Media playback is not supported on this device First-half tries from Vincent Clerc and Maxime Medard opened a lead of 16 unanswered points as England shipped penalties and made basic errors across the park. England struck back with a fine try from Ben Foden and closed to within seven points with three minutes left when Mark Cueto capitalised on a break from replacement Matt Banahan. But they ran out of time and inspiration as Les Bleus set up a deserved semi-final clash with Wales. France, so poor in their pool matches, were a side transformed as they took revenge for their World Cup defeats of 2007 and 2003. "England were blown away in the first half and probably got a proper telling off. They came out with a little more pace and precision but they made too many mistakes with knock-ons, penalites and turnovers. England were never going to score from 80m out. "Those who have watched England before could see they were not any different but whereas Scotland and Argentina couldn't last the distance and England won late on, France were a different outfit." The defeat will leave manager Martin Johnson under pressure after his gamble of pairing Jonny Wilkinson and Toby Flood at 10 and 12 failed to ignite the England back line, while his forwards were repeatedly second best at the set-piece and in the loose. Johnson's contract expires in November, and four weeks as memorable for scandals off the pitch as any achievements on it will do little to appease the notoriously twitchy committee-men at the Rugby Football Union. France were supposedly a team in pieces, beaten by Tonga just a week ago and with coach Marc Lievremont publicly berating his players, but so clear-cut was their victory that much of the atmosphere had been sucked from the contest long before the end. England had an early opportunity with a line-out deep in French territory after a clever grubber from Foden only for Lionel Nallet to burgle back possession, and they then tore into France again as Alexis Palisson was smashed backwards after taking a garryowen and Manu Tuilagi thundered into Morgan Parra. After spluttering sporadically for four games, England's Kiwi campaign ended as it probably deserved to: in defeat, to a team that was more dynamic, more clinical and far more composed when it mattered most. Read more from Tom's blog But it was the most fleeting of false dawns. Dmitri Yachvilli slotted a penalty from distance after Flood failed to release his man on the deck, and France took a grip they would never relinquish. Wilkinson was struggling, sending the re-start straight into touch and flinging a pass the same way, and France then went close to the first try of the contest as Clerc took a long pass out on the left and was just bundled into touch by the corner flag. Yachvilli made it 6-0 with a second sweet strike from 45 metres after Matt Stevens was penalised for collapsing a scrum, and then slid another penalty just wide from the same spot. England's players had talked of "blitzing" France in the first 20 minutes, but it was Lievremont's men with all the menace and danger. Another line-out was stolen, and when the ball was sent left Clerc stepped and spun through limp challenges from Wilkinson, Chris Ashton and Foden to dive over and make it 11-0. England were once again static in their few attacks, only Tuilagi's bullocking runs offering any threat, Flood reduced to aiming a long-range drop-goal pit which missed by a street. Louis Deacon shipped another sloppy penalty, allowing Yachvili to kick to the corner, and after thunderous drives from the forwards left wing Alexis Palisson and Medard combined out wide to put the full-back in for France's second try. England were in disarray, only Yachvili's failures with the conversions keeping them in the game, and when they finally created space for their wingers Cueto was dragged down metres from the line before another wayward pass from Wilkinson shut the door on Ashton wide out right. England had never before come back to win from a margin of more than 12 points, and the errors continued to come thick and fast as Tom Croft became the latest to cough up the ball. They grabbed an unlikely lifeline when Ben Youngs took a quick tap and go to release Foden, who jinked and dummied his way over to make it 16-5 with 23 minutes left on the clock, Wilkinson popping over the conversion for 16-7. Johnson threw on his replacements but England kept wasting what good field possession they could work. Flood popped out a careless off-load deep in the French 22 to allow a clearing kick to snuff out the danger, and when Nick Easter tried to rumble from deep within his own 22 his hospital pass to Tuilagi triggered another knock-on. France, led by man-of-the-match Imanol Harinordoquy, set up camp in front of the English posts, and when the ball was fed back to Trinh-Duc the replacement fly-half slotted the drop-goal to make it 19-7. Banahan's late charge allowed Cueto to touch down for a try at the death, but with Flood's conversion sliding wide England needed a converted try to force extra time - something they could neither conjure nor say their performance deserved. England: Foden, Ashton, Tuilagi, Flood, Cueto, Wilkinson, Youngs, Stevens, Thompson, Cole, Deacon, Palmer, Croft, Moody, Easter. Replacements: Wigglesworth for Wilkinson (65), Banahan for Youngs (65), Corbisiero for Stevens (49), Hartley for Thompson (56), Shaw for Deacon (49), Lawes for Croft (46), Haskell for Moody (63). France: Medard, Clerc, Rougerie, Mermoz, Palisson, Parra, Yachvili, Poux, Servat, Mas, Pape, Nallet, Dusautoir, Bonnaire, Harinordoquy. Replacements: Marty for Rougerie (68), Trinh-Duc for Yachvili (53), Barcella for Poux (56), Szarzewski for Servat (56), Pierre for Pape (65), Picamoles for Harinordoquy (72). Not Used: Heymans.	England's World Cup dreams fell apart under a French onslaught on a night when their shortcomings were brutally exposed at the quarter-final stage.
A 67-year-old was pronounced dead at the scene of the accident on the A7, a mile north of Stow. She had been driving a Volkswagen Polo which overturned after being involved in a collision with an Audi A6 at 16:35 on Tuesday. Police said a 95-year-old woman, who was one of two female passengers in the Audi, later died from her injuries at a hospital in Edinburgh. A spokesman for the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service said a driver and a passenger were trapped in one of the cars when they arrived at the scene. He said they were helped by a passing nurse, who administered oxygen to one of the casualties, before paramedics arrived and the injured people were removed from the vehicle. Police said the male driver of the Audi and a second passenger in his car were taken to the Royal Infirmary in Edinburgh but they did not sustain life-threatening injures. Police closed the road for six hours following the crash and have appealed for information from witnesses. Sgt Brian Smith said: "Tragically, this incident has resulted in the death of two women and we are now working to establish exactly what happened. "I would ask that any motorists who were on the A7 near Stow yesterday and have information that can assist with our investigation contacts police immediately."	Two woman have died following a head-on road crash in the Borders.
Bill Palmer, from Southampton, called the Alex Dyke show on BBC Radio Solent about his life after his wife went into a nursing home. Dyke immediately ordered a taxi to bring Mr Palmer to the studio to allow phone-in listeners to chat to him. A recording of the call has been viewed tens of thousands of times on Facebook. The 95-year-old, from Sholing, married his wife Sheila, 85, on 2 June 2014 after they had been friends for 30 years. Shortly afterwards Sheila - who has dementia and colitis - fell and was taken into hospital. She was then moved into a nursing home, where she now lives. Mr Palmer phoned the BBC Radio Solent programme on Wednesday during a phone-in on "Love - later in life". Although he visits his wife every day, he said: "Every day is hell. I feel so alone". The production team immediately arranged to take Mr Palmer to the studio in Southampton, where he sat in on the rest of the show. Mr Palmer said: "I just sit with my wife and we tell each other we love each other, and that's it. "She knows who I am and she often says 'we did get married on the second of June didn't we?' - and that's when it hurts. "I listen to the radio and watch TV and have lots of friends, but unfortunately when you get old people don't visit - that's life." Listeners phoned in to offer support and advice to Mr Palmer. He was offered Sunday lunch, afternoon trips out and a ukulele orchestra to play for him, but he kindly turned them all down. "I didn't know such kindness existed," he told one caller. Dyke said Mr Palmer had "touched the hearts of thousands of listeners" and it was his "nicest moment in 30 years of broadcasting".	A 95-year-old invited into a BBC radio programme after calling in about being lonely has become a hit on social media.
Connor Williams, 17, and Conor Tiley, 18, both from Aberbargoed, died in a crash on New Road, Tir-y-Berth, Hengoed, on 3 January. The teenager was arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving. Gwent Police confirmed no further action would be taken.	A 17-year-old boy arrested following a crash which killed two teenagers in Caerphilly county has been released without charge.
The carriageway was closed between junction 15 near Northampton and Newport Pagnell Services, with congestion stretching back as far as junction 15a for Towcester. Police were called to the incident at about 18:45 BST on Thursday and have also closed two northbound lanes. A Northamptonshire Police spokesman said traffic was being turned around in an attempt to get it off the motorway.	A lorry fire has closed a southbound section of the M1 in Northamptonshire.
An off-duty inspector found the girl in Grange Lane, Lye, near Pedmore Technology College, Stourbridge. Police are seeking a light grey or blue vehicle in connection with the crash. Sgt Steve Newbury said: "It's shocking to think someone could leave a child seriously hurt in the street, drive off and make no effort to get her medical treatment." Updates on this story and more from the Black Country He added: "Clearly this is distressing at any time for the girl's family, but to happen just days before Christmas is truly heartbreaking." The girl suffered a fractured skull and internal injuries in the crash, thought to have happened just before 22:00 GMT on Thursday. A spokesman for West Midlands Ambulance Service said it was clear "the 15-year-old had multiple serious injuries" and there was no car at the location. "She was treated at the scene by ambulance staff before being taken to Russells Hall Hospital." Her condition on arrival there was described as critical but stable.	A 15-year-old girl has been critically injured in a suspected hit-and-run in the Black Country.
His body was found on concrete steps in North Street in the early hours of Sunday morning. He was treated by medical staff but was pronounced dead at the scene. Gardaí (Irish police) have appealed for information about the incident.	A man in his 50s has died after being seriously assaulted in Swords, County Dublin.
Mahmoud Amir Alagha is working in four dimensions to capture digitally the way partial paralysis affects people's expressions. His research is supported by the university which awarded him a scholarship and supported him when, as a refugee from the conflict in Syria, he applied for permission to stay in the UK. Mahmoud began studying in Glasgow in 2014 but was only able to complete his postgraduate course because he received a fee-waiver scholarship from the university. The 28-year-old graduated with distinction in his Masters degree and hopes to take his research to a higher level. He is currently applying to do his PhD and the UK government has given him leave to remain for five years. Mahmoud has been using technology developed in Scotland to capture 3D images of moving faces. "This is stepping into the fourth dimension," he says. "Capturing 3D images over time." After capturing the images he superimposes a digital mask. "This mask is composed of points, could be thousands," Mahmoud says. "It is a mathematical construction so you can do decimation to make more points or reduce the number of points. "It depends how much is really clinically significant." Those thousands of reference points highlight how our faces move, or fail to move, because of injury, conditions such as Bell's Palsy or the aftermath of surgery, which can cause facial paralysis. Mahmoud say this technique could provide pointers to the correct treatment. He says: "Muscles move the face. There are a very big number of muscles. "Being able to decode the face by region, for example, you can know that this muscle that is being supplied by that branch of the nerve is being affected because it is paralysed or is weak. "Being able to study the region rather than the whole face, or both of them, gives us a new dimension into the management of these cases." Mahmoud, who is from war-torn Aleppo, was half way through his masters degree when he became a refugee. He says: "By the end of the first year, the situation in Syria got mad. I had at some point to apply for asylum in the UK and the asylum process was harsh. "I could not afford the tuition fees for the second year. At that point I was stepping into the unknown. I felt like I was losing my solid ground." Ashraf Ayoub, professor of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery at Glasgow University, has been Mahmoud's mentor and supporter during his quest for refugee status. He says: "If it was rejected he would have been deported immediately. That would have been very dangerous for him and undermine what he had achieved in the first year and destroy him as a human being and as a potential scientific researcher." Practical support came from the university in the form of the scholarship, one of four given to refugee students. Prof Ayoub says it has paid off handsomely. He says: "Number one, the enthusiasm. He wanted really to break the mould and innovate the application of this technology. "He also brought to it some of his own ideas of how we take this further. He also conducted a very successful pilot study as part of his Masters degree that he was awarded with distinction." Since the 1970s, the Glasgow Coma scale, developed by two Glasgow university professors at the Southern General has been the global standard for assessing patient consciousness. Mahmoud wants to create a similar framework in his own field - the Glasgow Index of Facial Paralysis. He says: "How can you really diagnose a patient or not without being subjective, to say 'yes, there is improvement' or relying on a ruler to measure movement between two parts of the face? "Having something that will tell you precisely what movement is there, the speed, the direction, the pattern of movement, where you can compare before and after, that is something that will benefit the patients and will advance the management of these patients."	A postgraduate researcher at Glasgow University is developing new technology designed to help people with paralysed faces.
The memorial event will be attended by hundreds of firefighters, police officers, paramedics and volunteers in a chapel overlooking the crash site. Emergency workers and community leaders have organised the 22 November service. It will come three months after a jet crashed on to the West Sussex A27 during the Shoreham Air Show. The Right Rev Dr Martin Warner will open the service at Lancing College with a prayer for the victims. He said it would be an important moment for people who were caught up in the "sudden and tragic events" of that day. The names of the victims will be read out ahead of a minute's silence at 13:22 GMT - the exact time of the crash. Each family will then light a candle to be placed on the chapel's altar. The relatives affected will also give the readings. Personal reflections of the rescue effort have been written and compiled and will be read out by Sussex Police Chief Constable Giles York, West Sussex Fire and Rescue Service Chief Fire Officer Sean Ruth, and South East Coast Ambulance Service chief executive Paul Sutton. Two days after the crash, Assistant Chief Constable Steve Barry said he had  never before in his career seen anything like the Shoreham crash, in terms of its scale, tragedy and impact on the local community. Friends and relatives gathered for the funeral of retired engineer Graham Mallinson at St Mary's Church, Newick, on Thursday, The keen photographer had been hoping to capture shots of the Vulcan bomber, which was making one of its last appearances at the air show, when the vintage Hawker Hunter jet crashed. He was described as being a "very dearly loved" husband, father and brother who would be "very sorely missed".	The families of 11 men who died in the Shoreham air crash will hear the reflections of emergency workers who dealt with the disaster at a service.
From Thursday, payments for some benefits will be limited to the first two children in a family. The Child Poverty Action Group and Institute for Public Policy Research say some families will be almost Â£3,000 a year worse off under the new rules. Ministers say they are determined to tackle the root causes of disadvantage and make work pay. The changes affect families who claim tax credits and Universal Credit - which is in the process of being rolled out and is due to replace tax credits completely by 2022. The new rules mean that children born after Thursday 6 April into families where there are already two or more children will no longer be counted in benefit payments to their parents, under either tax credits or Universal Credit. And from autumn 2018, families making new claims under Universal Credit will only receive payments for their first two children even if they were born before Thursday. However, children already receiving Universal Credit or tax credit payments will not lose them for as long as their family's existing claim continues. And Child Benefit, which is separate, will be unaffected. The latest official figures show that 872,000 families with more than two children were claiming tax credits in 2014-15. And a similar number of families are likely to lose out under the changes, the researchers suggest. In 2014-15, two thirds (65%) were working families and 68% had no more than three children, say the researchers. Based on those figures, the researchers calculate that once the new policy is fully implemented an additional 100,000 adults and 200,000 children could face poverty. Among those affected will be families with more than two children who are not currently on benefits but who might need to claim in future because of unforeseen redundancy, illness, separation or death, the researchers warn. They also suggest that the policy could: "It may also leave women who become pregnant with a third child, for example through contraception failure, with a difficult choice between moving into poverty and having an abortion," they add. The researchers also criticise a lack of advance publicity about the change on the main Universal Credit website, particularly if the policy was intended "to inform parents' choices about having children". Child Poverty Action Group's chief executive Alison Garnham called it a "particularly pernicious cut because it suggests some children matter more than others". "It's also illogical because no parent has a crystal ball," she added. "Families that can comfortably support a third child today could struggle tomorrow and have to claim Universal Credit because, sadly, health, jobs and relationships can fail. "Surely children should not have their life chances damaged because of the number of siblings they have." A Department for Work and Pensions spokeswoman called the current benefits structure "unsustainable and not fair to the taxpayer and families who support themselves solely through work". "Work is the best route out of poverty, which is why our welfare reforms are designed to support people into employment," said the spokeswoman.	Changes to benefit rules coming into force this week could push 200,000 more children into poverty, say campaigners.
The German shepherd, which belonged to Cleveland Police, was being exercised near to Ormseby Stables in Eston when it bit a 28-year-old man. The man suffered puncture wounds on his arm and upper body and was taken to hospital. The dog handler also suffered an injury to his arm. The force has apologised and referred itself to the Independent Police Complaints Commission. A police spokesman said: "Based on an assessment of the animal it has been put to sleep. "This was not an easy decision for any of the people involved, but has been made in the best interests of all those involved." The incident occurred on 6 June. Temporary Assistant Chief Constable Ciaron Irvine said it would be "wrong to speculate" until the full circumstances were known. "What is clear is that this incident should not have happened and we must absolutely understand what went wrong," he added.	A police dog has been put down after biting a member of the public.
A total of 112 high street banks have closed since July 2015 - with a further 33 due to close their doors within the coming months. The research covered Bank of Scotland, Barclays, Clydesdale, Royal Bank of Scotland, Santander and TSB-branded banks across the country. All the banks said the closures reflected changing customer habits. Edinburgh has seen the greatest number of closures - with more than 20 banks to close in the city. In Aberdeen - nine branches have closed or are earmarked for closure. Over half of them are with TSB, but the business said it was set to open a new "super-branch" to meet the changing needs of customers. "We will be opening the first of our brand new purpose built sites in Aberdeen on St Nicholas Street later this year," a spokeswoman for the bank said. "The new branch concept has been designed in response to customer research and feedback." TSB said the branch would blend new technology and self-service consoles, alongside 13 face-to-face meeting rooms as their feedback showed 88% of customers wanted people on hand to help them. TSB - which was spun-off from Lloyds Banking Group in 2014 and is now owned by Spanish banking giant Sabadell - inherited branches from the Cheltenham and Gloucester brand. It has closed nine branches in Scotland with another seven set to shut their doors before Christmas. Even though many closures are in urban areas, rural Scotland has been hit hard. Eight banks are closing in Highland, with Aberdeenshire and the Scottish Borders losing five. In Moray eight branches are to close - the most closures per head of population. There, Bank of Scotland says new mobile bank branches - equipped with online technology and covering one extra route - will meet the needs of their customers. The bank's director, Mike Moran, said: "We'll still offer cash transactions, both to pay money in and take money out, but we'll also have digital capabilities so we'll have broadband connections, wifi connections on the mobile branch and we'll have iPad-like tablets." Bank of Scotland - owned by state-backed Lloyds Group - has closed a total of 28 branches in the last year, with a further 23 due to close before the end of 2016. RBS has closed 51 branches since July last year. Clydesdale Bank has closed 14 up to August - with another three branches to go by the end of September. Santander has closed seven and Barclays three. The banks maintain the void closures leave can be filled online and by apps, telephone banking, and mobile or extended branches in city centres. But the literal void left by the empty branches on Scotland's high streets could pose more of a challenge to fill. Paul Jennings, a commercial real estate lawyer with Aberdein Considine, said: "The bigger retailers are more likely to look first and foremost at the bespoke shopping centres and retail outlets. "I think the larger city centre bank branches lend themselves probably better to the restaurant and certainly to bars and coffeehouses and nightclubs."	Scotland is losing more than 140 bank branches over an 18-month period, according to BBC research.
By the time a baby takes its first breath many of the key pathways between nerves have already been made. And some of these will help determine how a baby thinks or sees the world, and may have a role to play in the development of conditions such as autism, scientists say. But how this rich neural network assembles in the baby before birth is relatively unchartered territory. Researchers from Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital, King's College London, Imperial College and Oxford University aim to produce a dynamic wiring diagram of how the brain grows, at a level of detail that they say has been impossible until now. They hope that by charting the journeys of bundles of nerves in the final three months of pregnancy, doctors will be able to understand more about how they can help in situations when this process goes wrong. Prof David Edwards, director of the Centre for the Developing Brain,  who is leading the research, says: "There is a distressing number of children in our society who grow up with problems because of things that happen to them around the time of birth or just before birth. "It is very important to be able to scan babies before they are born, because we can capture a period when an awful lot is changing inside the brain, and it is a time when a great many of the things that might be going wrong do seem to be going wrong." The study - known as the Developing Human Connectome Project - hopes to look at more than 1,500 babies, studying many aspects of their neurological development. By examining the brains of babies while they are still growing in the womb, as well as those born prematurely and at full term, the scientists will try to define baselines of normal development and investigate how these may be affected by problems around birth. And they plan to share their map with the wider research community. Central to this project are advanced MRI scanning techniques, which the scientists say are able to pick up on details of the growing brain that have been difficult to capture until now. While in the womb, foetuses are free to somersault in their amniotic sacs, and this constant movement has so far hindered clear images of growing brains. But researchers at the Centre for the Developing Brain have found ways to counter the effects of these movements, building up full three-dimensional pictures while the foetus is in motion. And by placing the MRI machine in the neonatal intensive care unit at Evelina Children's Hospital in London they are one of the few centres in the world to have a scanner in such close proximity to the babies who often need it most, Prof Edwards says. This means the same scanning system can be used to find out more about the brains of the sickest and smallest newborn babies, he says. Daniel Rueckert, professor of visual information processing at Imperial College London, who is also involved in the research, says: "We are trying to look at brain connectivity in two ways: firstly, from a structural perspective, to find out which parts of the brain are wired to other parts. And secondly we are looking at functional connectivity - how strongly two brain regions are linked across time and activity." But Prof Partha Mitra, a neuroscientist at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, New York state, says we need to be aware of the limitations of the technology in use. "It would obviously be a very good thing to know more about the circuits in the developing human brain. Much of what we know hasn't changed in a hundred years and has come from dissection studies. "But we need to keep in mind the imaging techniques we have are indirect - we can't open up a human brain and look at the connections while someone is alive so we rely on these non-invasive methods.  But there is a big gap between the real circuits in the brain and what images can show us." Prof Rueckert acknowledges that this map will provide a "macro-level" view of the developing brain and not be the "final answer". But he points to early results from the adult version of this project  - the Human Connectome Project, based in the US: "There is so much evidence already from the adult project that there are significant changes in the brain that can be mapped with the technology we have now. "It will be incredibly useful to be able to do this with the still growing and developing brain - perhaps giving us more time to intervene when things go wrong."	UK scientists have embarked on a six-year project to map how nerve connections develop in babies' brains while still in the womb and after birth.
Tomer Hemed supplied two goals and scored a third as Chris Hughton's side bounced back from defeat at Cardiff. Jamie Murphy and former City striker Sam Baldock had the Seagulls two ahead early on before Hemed latched on to Beram Kayal's ball for the third goal. Mark Little deflected the fourth into his own net, while Kieran Agard hit the crossbar with a late penalty for City. Victory for Brighton keeps them fourth in the table on an evening when the division's top four sides all won. Media playback is not supported on this device Hemed, a summer arrival from Almeria, scored his ninth league goal of the season to effectively wrap up the points on 56 minutes. He had already showed his creative side for Murphy's early finish from inside the area, and then Baldock's low drive from the edge of the box in the first half. The Israel international also went close to a second goal when he drilled a long-range shot just over the bar. On a night to forget for Lee Johnson and his side, they were denied a stoppage-time consolation from the spot when Agard could only strike the bar from 12 yards. Bristol City head coach Lee Johnson: "It was a frustrating night. We huffed and we puffed to try and blow their house down, but theirs was made of brick and ours was made of paper. "It disappointed me that we ran out of ideas after Brighton's first goal and there are no excuses. We weren't good enough on the night. "There is a positive in the fact that the bottom three all lost and another round of games has gone by, but we want to be looking up the table." Brighton manager Chris Hughton: "I was delighted the penalty didn't go in at the end because it would have put a damper on a near-perfect team performance. "We had to improve because the display at Cardiff wasn't good enough and Bristol have been in good form and we only won comfortably because we did everything right. "It was as complete a performance as we have put in all season. We are not a team who scores a lot of goals so to get four was very pleasing."	Brighton got their Championship promotion push back on track with an emphatic win at Bristol City.
The 54-year-old has left his job as assistant first-team coach at Barnet to join the National League club on a rolling contract. Waddock led the Shots into the Football League in 2008 with a then record points total of 101 and left in 2009. The ex-Republic of Ireland international replaces Barry Smith, who left the Shots at the end of this season after not renewing his contract. Waddock previously spent two years in charge at the Recreation Ground, before taking over at Wycombe in 2009. He later had spells at Oxford United and Portsmouth. His first managerial job was at QPR, where he previously made his name as a player. "It's a situation I never thought I'd be in, but I'm delighted to be here," Waddock told Aldershot's website. "I've missed the people here and I've missed the supporters. The atmosphere they created at home games was amazing and I loved that. "We have to be able to give them something to cheer about and we're going to try our best to get this place rocking again."	Gary Waddock has returned to Aldershot Town for a second spell as manager.
Darren Turk, 53, of Fontridge Lane in Etchingham, is charged with 14 offences including rape and indecent assault between 1996 and 2002. At the time he was a member of the care staff, and later head of care, at Frewen College in Northiam. He has been bailed to appear before Hastings Magistrates' Court on 1 July. Sussex Police said the charges did not involve any staff or pupils currently at the school. Frewen College is a day and boarding school for children aged between seven and 19 with specific learning difficulties such as dyslexia, dyspraxia and dyscalculia.	A man has been accused of committing sexual offences against boys at an East Sussex school where he worked more than a decade ago.
The Waking the Dragon tower was granted permission by Wrexham council back in February 2011. Businessman Simon Wingett is trying to raise £2.5m to build the bronze sculpture, cultural centre and gardens at Chirk Park. Councillors are expected to grant the extension at a meeting on Tuesday. The 23.5m (77ft)-high dragon with wings spanning 57m (187ft) would stand on top of a 41.5m (147ft) tower at the former colliery site. Mr Wingett has said the sculpture will rival other well-known landmarks such as the Angel of the North, but time is running out on planning permission for the project granted back in 2011. He hopes to raise £1m for the visitor attraction from the public, with the rest of the cash raised through loans from Finance Wales and grants from the Welsh Government. In a report to the council's planning committee, officers say the development would be a "significant tourism draw to the area". Councillors are recommended to approve the extension allowing Mr Wingett five more years to commence building at the site.	A man hoping to build an 224ft-high Welsh dragon tower on the English border will ask councillors for an extra five years to start the project.
The British Speedway Promoters' Association, whose chairman Keith Chapman has been involved in negotiations to keep the club going, say an agreement has been reached. It has also been announced that a 15-year lease has been signed for the team's Beaumont Park venue. "Hopefully this is a new start for the club and it will have a good future," Chapman told BBC Radio Leicester. "Further meetings are now necessary to establish the management structure of the club, a racenight for the 2017 season and other arrangements," said a Leicester Speedway statement.	Leicester Lions' future has been secured following financial problems.
The concert was held amid tight security at the heavily protected Intercontinental Hotel. It was a rare music concert in the city. Kabul has witnessed a series of suicide attacks and explosions in the past few months. Saturday evening's concert was originally scheduled to be held in Ghazi stadium to mark the country's Independence Day. More than 3,000 tickets were sold at premium rates. But the authorities said they could not guarantee security at that venue. Ms Sayeed did not give up. She went ahead with her performance, but at a different venue. Her fans were delighted. "Despite the threats, I didn't think such a big number of girls would attend here. Fortunately, the number of women is bigger than men," said Bahar Sohaili, who attended the concert.. "I asked some of the girls: 'Why you are here?' They told me they were here to defy those who were against the concert." Ms Sayeed, described by her fans as Afghanistan's Kim Kardashian, is known for her long hair and figure-hugging outfits, which are seen as taboo by many in Afghanistan. Her music mixes traditional and folk songs rendered as pop. She sings both in Dari and Pashto, Afghanistan's two main languages. A day before the concert, I interviewed Ms Sayeed. She said she was determined to go ahead with the concert, despite the threats. "I am taking this as a very good excuse to be able to give a bit of happiness to my fellow Afghans, who are in dire need of it at the moment," she said. She has received a number of death threats from those who say her outfits and public shows are an affront to Afghan culture. "There are certain people in Afghanistan who have been against music, against celebration, against even New Year, Eid and everything. I feel like today we need to stand together and fight against it," said Ms Sayeed. "At the end of the day, we are also human beings and these are basic human needs - music, celebration, Independence Day, New Year." Ms Sayeed said she would donate the proceeds from the concert to the families of those killed by Islamist militants in an attack on the village of Mirza Olong in northern Sar-e-Pul province.	Hundreds of young men and women attended a concert by Afghan pop star Aryana Sayeed in the capital Kabul despite opposition from conservatives, and threats of an attack.
Gavin Roberts, 28, died of a brain injury on 15 June, four days after the collision on the A34 near the Compton junction in Oxfordshire. Megan Williamson's petition calls for the speed limit to be reduced. One month on from the crash that killed him she said "changes need to be made". "I just knew that Gavin would not want anybody to suffer as we have," she said. She wants the speed limit reduced from 70 mph to 50 mph, saying "people treat it like a motorway and it is a very narrow road". "There's no hard shoulder either, so if there are any accidents the emergency vehicles find it difficult to get down there." Mr Roberts was originally from Australia but had recently moved to Swindon where he worked for Network Rail. On the night of the collision, a Vauxhall Corsa travelling southbound smashed through the central reservation and into the path of Mr Roberts' BMW. Richard Hayes, the chief executive of the Institute of Highway Engineers, said Ms Williamson's suggestion would make the road safer, and called for the A34 to be upgraded. He added: "I'm absolutely sure [the barriers] are not as integrated as they should be... and that may well be eased by reducing the speed limit." The carriageway was closed 15 times in 2015 due to fatalities or injuries, and 56 times in the last five years, Highways England confirmed. A spokesman said safety was its top priority, and that it monitored the A34 on an ongoing basis. "Our thoughts go out to all those affected by the recent tragic incident," he said. Thames Valley Police said no arrests had been made following the collision and it was still appealing for witnesses.	The girlfriend of a man who died on a stretch of road where more than 50 people have been killed or injured in the last five years has called for tougher speed restrictions.
He's been disqualified in the final at Queen's Club for kicking out at an advertising panel. But it wasn't just the panel that felt his frustration - the sign broke and cut the leg of a line judge. Nalbandian was disqualified for unsporting behaviour and the match was awarded to his opponent Marin Cilic. After the match, Nalbandian admitted he went too far saying, "I am very sorry, sometimes you get frustrated on court." Maybe he should think about a new career in sport - karate perhaps?	Argentinian tennis player David Nalbandian might be wishing he'd kept a lid on his temper.
Pavey, a mother of two who only gave birth to her younger child Emily 11 months ago, ran the perfect tactical race to match the gold won by her old friend Paula Radcliffe in Munich 12 years ago. When France's Clemence Calvin - 16 years her junior and almost 20 seconds faster this season - went to the front with two laps to go Pavey tucked in behind. Then, at the bell, the Briton surged into the lead, held Calvin at bay on the back straight and kicked hard again as she came off the top bend to race to her first ever major title. She becomes the oldest female gold medallist in the championships' history, and having won Commonwealth 5,000m bronze 10 days ago seals a wonderful summer at an age when most athletes are long retired. Pavey told BBC Sport: "I just can't believe it. I was finding it quite a long way - I was thinking, is this the right event? "I'm really thrilled. I tried to do a controlled last lap, but when I got to the home straight I thought, just give it all you've got, so you don't regret anything." The time - 32 minutes 22.39 seconds - was irrelevant, Calvin hanging on for silver and her compatriot Laila Traby taking bronze. British team captain Goldie Sayers had given a speech on the eve of the championships asking her team-mates a simple question: "How would you perform if this was the last time you would ever compete?" Her room-mate Pavey gave the best possible answer. The Exeter Harrier has been running for her country for so long that she made her debut in a British vest in the same year her team-mate Morgan Lake was born. Across four Olympic Games she has secured three top ten places, but this was a glorious finale that few could have predicted. And on her lap of honour she ran to Emily and four-year-old son Jacob before embracing husband and coach Gavin and her own parents. Earlier, all three of the British men made it safely through to Wednesday's semi-finals of the 100m, Dwain Chambers winning the second heat in 10.18 secs and James Dasaolu the third, easing up in 10.22 secs, before Harry Aikines-Aryeetey took his in 10.19 secs. But France's Jimmy Vicaut, the only man in the field to run under 10 seconds this summer, looks the man to beat after an impressive 10.06 secs - the joint third fastest time in the championships' long history. World champion Christine Ohuruogu also appears to be coming into some form at the right time, winning her 400m heat in 51.40 secs, while Tiffany Porter is into the 100m hurdles final as the fastest qualifier. But there was disappointment for Britain's two 800m men, Andrew Osagie and Michael Rimmer, who failed to get through to the semi-finals, 28 years after the famous night when Sebastian Coe, Tom McKean and Steve Cram won European gold, silver and bronze for a British clean sweep.	Forty-year-old Jo Pavey became the oldest woman ever to claim gold at a European Championships when she won a thrilling 10,000m and got Team GB's campaign in Zurich off to the perfect start.
Handing over an envelope containing 50,000 Vietnamese dong (VND) ($2.4, Â£1.6) did not do the trick, but when she added another 50,000 VND, the referral was secured. The 33-year-old woman, who did not want to be identified, then gave an envelope containing 500,000 VND ($24, Â£16) to the medical staff at the provincial hospital, an amount that was more than two months of her income. "All other patients told me that everyone must give envelopes to thank the doctors and nurses for the treatment, and that was the rate for such an operation," she said. The staff did not ask for it but she believed that by giving the envelope her son would receive better care. She is not alone. Mrs Phin, a pensioner from a Hanoi suburb who lives on 3m VND per month, handed over an envelope containing 200,000 VND after eye treatment in hospital. But she was sent home before the treatment was complete. So she was admitted to hospital again and that meant another thank-you envelope. "It cost me another 200,000 VND to thank the doctors and nurses. I could only afford the smallest amount suggested by other patients," she said. Mrs Luyen, a retired teacher from a small town 35km outside of Hanoi, said passing over a cash gift for medical treatment was effectively mandatory. "Not all doctors ask for the envelopes but giving envelopes is a must when you go to hospital. It's in our culture," she said. In Vietnam, medical treatment is mostly subsidised by the state via an insurance system free to civil servants and children, or paid for privately or by employers. But queues for treatment under insurance cover are long and public hospitals overcrowded, while salaries for much of the medical profession remain low. And with growing capitalist sentiment meeting entrenched Confucian values, the practice of handing over a cash-filled envelope to secure faster or better service has become widespread. The number of people who gave envelopes doubled in the three years from 2007-2010 - from 13% to 29%, one study showed. In 2012, a survey published by the World Bank and Vietnam's Government Inspectorate (which runs the Anti-Corruption Bureau) showed that 76% of those who had paid a bribe to health service personnel did so voluntarily, with only 21% responding to a request. In an effort to fight corruption, five big hospitals in Hanoi launched a campaign in October 2011 to bolster ethical behaviour among staff, including a "Say no to envelopes" policy. Vietnam's Research and Training Centre for Community Development (RTCCD) also conducted a similar campaign to change perceptions of informal payments, using the media to raise patients' awareness of their rights as well as of doctors' duties. Nguyen Huu Ngoc, a well-known scholar in Hanoi, said the root of the problem lay in the Confucian gift-giving tradition. "In Vietnamese society as well as in Chinese, gifts stem from gratitude," the scholar said. "Showing gratitude used to have more spiritual value than material value. But over the years, it has become more material and less spiritual, and now in the market economy it is like a transaction." Culture might be used to justify the payments - but culture can be changed, according to Soren Davidsen, a senior governance specialist at the World Bank in Hanoi. "We know gift-giving is an important part of culture. But we also know that culture is not a static but dynamic thing. Several countries in East Asia, such as Singapore, South Korea and Japan, have a culture of corruption, yet these countries have found effective ways to curb corruption. "Although there is often the perception about culture being a part of corruption, we think that this is the wrong way of looking at it. And we can, by involving people, businesses and government in partnership, actually change culture," said Mr Davidsen. For many people, the line between a gift and a bribe has become blurred - something some people embrace as "an excuse to give envelopes", said Tran Thu Ha, vice-director of RTCCD. But for people who campaign to stop the practice like her, it is easy to identify what is a gift and what is a bribe. "A gift can be given in public or anywhere, it needs time to talk and to say thank you, whereas a bribe is often given very quickly and both the giver and the receiver are afraid of being seen by other people," Ms Ha said. But to change people's behaviour is one of the big difficulties that Vietnam is facing and will take time, acknowledged Mr Ngo Manh Hung, deputy director-general of Vietnam's Anti-Corruption Bureau. There has been considerable debate about how to curb the practice in the health service. One suggestion is raising health workers' salaries so that they stop accepting envelopes. But that alone will not be enough. Associate Professor Ta Van Binh, director of the National Institute of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders, believes that the government needs clear rules and tough punishments for medical staff who break them. But work also needs to be done to help patients understand that they do not need to give envelopes - and may themselves be breaking the rules if they do. Nguyen Huu Ngoc even thinks that there should be sanctions applied to patients who give envelopes to help clean up the industry. But this would need co-operation from all sides - patients, health workers and the authorities - and remains a big task. "It's not an easy thing to do because corruption is about money, people and power," said Mr Davidsen of the World Bank. "It's a huge challenge curbing corruption and co-ordinating anti-corruption efforts across government agencies. It is not a quick fix and can't be done overnight." There will be a series of special reports and articles this week as the BBC examines why bribes and backhanders are part of the system in so much of the world, looks at countries which have tried to roll back the tide - and explains how corruption works.	Three months ago, a woman from a village south of Hanoi needed her son referred to a provincial hospital by a district doctor for an operation.
The All Progressives Congress (APC) won 19 of the 28 governor posts in results declared from Saturday's elections. It is the biggest defeat for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) since military ruled ended in 1999. It lost the presidential poll last month for the first time. APC leader Muhammadu Buhari will be inaugurated on 29 May, after he defeated President Goodluck Jonathan. The PDP's decline has been reinforced by results from Saturday's elections for governors and state assemblies, reports the BBC's Bashir Saad Abdullahi from the capital, Abuja. The party lost for the first time in key northern states like Katsina and Kaduna, the home of outgoing Vice-President Namadi Sambo. It also lost control of Adamawa, one of three states badly hit by militant Islamist group Boko Haram's insurgency. However, the party managed to hold on to Rivers State, Nigeria's oil hub. The PDP won eight governorships, mostly in the south-east. Taraba is the only result still outstanding, while the election in Imo state was declared inconclusive, because the number of spoilt ballot papers was larger than the margin of victory. Elections were not held in seven states. Analysis: Chris Ewokor, BBC Africa, Abuja The APC has made historic gains, relegating the once-powerful PDP to a regional party. The PDP failed to get a national spread of votes, doing well only in the south-east and the oil-rich Niger Delta. Most states in the north went to the APC, along with Nigeria's commercial hub, Lagos, in the south-west. However, the APC failed to win in any of Nigeria's five oil-producing states. This will be of huge concern to President-elect Muhammadu Buhari, as militant groups could disrupt oil production and starve the federal government of much-needed oil revenue.  It is unlikely that the PDP governors in the five states would help Gen Buhari rein in the militants. In parts of the country, the elections were marred by violence due to stiff rivalry, and the battle for power and money. Ethnic differences also fuelled the conflict in some areas, but overall the elections have been more peaceful than in previous years, raising hopes that Nigeria's democracy is maturing. Why Jonathan lost? Buhari's historic victory Nigeria's 36 governors enjoy wide powers and are extremely influential. Some, especially in oil-producing areas, control bigger budgets than those of national governments in some neighbouring West African countries. The Independent National Electoral Commission (Inec) reported 66 violent incidents at polling stations - higher than in the presidential poll. Most of the violence took place in Rivers and other southern states, where voting at some polling stations had to be extended. On Sunday, Inec also announced that the APC had retained power in Lagos state. It means that when Gen Buhari takes over the presidency it will be the first time that the party of the president has controlled Lagos - the commercial capital - since the advent of multi-party democracy in 1999. Our correspondent says the PDP will have to go through a period of introspection, and then rebuild itself under a new leader. The party was in power for 16 years, and voters felt that it was time for change, he says. It had been hit by the defection of governors and MPs to the APC ahead of the elections. The PDP also faced widespread allegations of corruption during its rule, and was accused of failing to do enough to end an Islamist-led insurgency in the north-east where it suffered huge defeats.	The party of Nigeria's incoming president has won a landslide in elections for powerful state governors, ending the former ruling party's dominance.
Hatton made eight birdies and three bogeys in his five-under-par 67, while Fitzpatrick carded a level-par 72. They are tied with Australia's Marc Leishman (71) at Bay Hill, three shots behind American leaders Charlie Hoffman (71) and Kevin Kisner (68). Rory McIlroy moved up to a tie for eighth after a seven-under-par 65. World number three McIlroy scored the joint-lowest round of the day, along with American Rickie Fowler - who moved into a tie for 11th. The 27-year-old Northern Irishman started the round 11 shots behind overnight leader Hoffman, but five birdies on the back nine moved him up the leaderboard. "I just played better, held some putts, which was nice to see. I just had to put it all together and I did," McIlroy told the PGA Tour. "Hopefully I can be in with a shout and then if I get off to a fast start tomorrow, I can be right in there."	England's Tyrrell Hatton and Matthew Fitzpatrick are both three shots off the lead going into the final round of the Arnold Palmer Invitational.
There was a fancy dress theme of "pirates and princesses" for the 44th Boxing Day swim from North Beach. Sea temperatures were 11 degrees - slightly warmer than the conditions for spectators. The event, organised by the Tenby Sea Swimming Association (TSSA),  is expected to raise thousands of pounds for charity. It prides itself on always going ahead, whatever the weather. Before the main event was a raft race around Goscar Rock, held in memory of Dai Rees, of Saundersfoot, who regularly took part. The challenge was won by his brothers, Adam and Richard, who came home at the head of the nine-craft fleet. Tenby's mayor Sue Lane said: "It's been a thoroughly enjoyable morning and a pleasure to see so many people turning up and in such wonderful costumes."	Hundreds of barmy bathers have been taking part in Tenby's annual festive dip.
The move by Flintshire council is partly aimed at increasing recycling rates to meet Welsh Government targets. A report to the council's cabinet said if enforcement action fails, it will need to reconsider introducing three-weekly bin collections. From June 2017, all rubbish will need to go into wheelie bins and anything else will not be collected. Then from September, anyone still leaving rubbish outside bins will face fixed penalty notices.	Householders who persistently leave out too much rubbish in Flintshire will face fines from next year.
I give him the benefit of the doubt - his arguably blasé attitude, I think, is a symptom of being consistently called upon to defend his creation. He is the co-creator of Tor, the most popular software available for gaining access to the part of the internet unreachable using a conventional browser - including what is often referred to as the dark or underground web. To some, Tor is a menace: a (largely) impenetrable system that enables some of the most depraved crimes to take place on the internet. To others, it is a lifeline, the only way to safely access the online services that most of us take for granted. Dingledine would rather we talked about the latter. The scale of the dark web - with its drug deals, weapons sales and child abuse imagery - is insignificant when considered in the bigger picture, he argues. But we must talk about the former. I meet Dingledine at this year's Def Con, the large underground hacking convention held in Las Vegas. The timing was ideal - the event came just over a week after the closure of two huge dark web marketplaces. The biggest, Alphabay, was said to boast more than 200,000 users and $1bn (£0.7bn) a year in revenue. Dingledine's talk was the day prior to our meeting, and in it he criticised misinformed journalists for sensationalising the size and scale of the dark web. "I think a lot of it comes down to incentive mismatches," he tells me, "where journalists have to create more controversy and get something so that everybody will want to read their article. "The story is privacy is under threat around the world, and that's been the story for a while - so they need a new story." The Tor Project's website has a section called "Abuse FAQ". It is here the group attempts to address the most controversial side of Tor use: that it is an enabler of criminals intent on carrying out the most shocking and sickening crimes. When talking about this, Dingledine invokes the "guns don't kill people" defence. Tor does not commit crime, he says, criminals do. "I would say that there are bad people on the internet and they're doing bad things, but Tor does not enable them to do the bad things. "It's not like there's a new set of bad people in the world who exist because Tor exists." I guess not. But I suggest that Tor indisputably provides a way in which a novice can make themselves essentially untraceable online. "I still think that most of the bad stuff on the internet has nothing to do with Tor," Dingledine insists. "Most of the bad stuff on the internet is due to huge criminal organisations. There's a lot of crime out there." In layman's terms, Tor hides your identity by pinging your connection around many different servers across the world, making your actual location extremely hard to track. There have been rumours that law enforcement has "cracked" Tor but, aside from isolated vulnerabilities, Dingledine says the concept remains solid. "As far as I know, no, they haven't [cracked Tor]. "Tor is the best option there is out there, but that doesn't mean Tor is perfect. No software is perfect." Any major busts and arrests have been traced back to human error - good old, old-fashioned policing. "Which is frustrating," Dingledine interjects, "Because the modern police world wants to just click a button and have the bad guy show up. Old-fashioned police work is hard, takes energy." Tor was mentioned in the documents leaked as part of Edward Snowden's whistleblowing in 2014. Under the delicate heading "Tor Stinks… but it could be worse", the National Security Agency (NSA) noted: "We will never be able to de-anonymise all Tor users all the time." Given this, you would think the US (and others) would be taking every step to weaken Tor. Ban it, even. But in fact, the US government has done more than any other to keep it alive - donating several million dollars to Dingledine and team since the project's inception in the nineties. He is confident that funding will continue. "A lot of the US government funding for internet freedom tools comes from Republicans. The current congress is quite supportive of giving people tools to keep people safer on the internet." The reason? The FBI, CIA, military and others all value anonymity too. In their ideal world, Tor would exist, but they would hold a secret key to break in. In 2014, Facebook's London team announced it had set up a way for users to access Facebook through Tor. More than a million people use the site in this way every month. "About 97% of Tor traffic has to do with people going to Facebook, and Wikipedia, and BBC, and ordinary websites on the internet, and they want to go there more safely," Dingledine says. "Whereas 3% of the traffic has to do with this 'dark web' thing…. I have to wave my hands when I say the phrase." The ability to access social networks anonymously is invaluable to people living in oppressive regimes or countries with high levels of surveillance around what citizens do online. But given the majority of users can be found in the US and Europe - in places not typically considered to be oppressive - I argued that Tor's justification hinging on the needs of activists perhaps seems less than convincing. "I think the line is getting a lot more blurry between the free countries, and the un-free countries," he says. ___________ Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC You can reach Dave securely through encrypted messaging app Signal on: +1 (628) 400-7370	When Roger Dingledine talks about the dark web, he waves his hands in the air - as if not quite convinced of its existence.
A blogger posted screenshots suggesting a Carmarthenshire councillor shared a Facebook post by a far-right group. The post said: "When a dog attacks a child it is put down. Shouldn't we do the same with sex predators?" Tegwen Devichand said she did not remember sharing the post and opposed the death penalty. Ms Devichand, who is Labour deputy group leader at Carmarthenshire council, said: "I couldn't put a horse down, let alone a human being." The post which Ms Devichand appears to have shared was initially posted by far-right group Britain First. Ms Devichand opposes plans to remove English-stream education at Ysgol Llangennech which were approved by Carmarthenshire council in January. "People should have choice, it shouldn't be forced on them," she said. The decision has been controversial with one Labour councillor Kim Thomas describing it as "segregation... at worst, apartheid". The decision has been controversial with one Labour councillor Kim Thomas describing it as "segregation... at worst, apartheid". Plaid Cymru has accused Labour members of working with UKIP to undermine the council's decision. She also said Labour had not contacted her about the matter and she had not been told the party was investigating. Ms Devichand said she was complaining to the police about a "hate campaign" against her. On Sunday Labour said a different member connected to the row had been suspended. Plaid Cymru Carmarthen East and Dinefwr MP Jonathan Edwards said over the course of the weekend "we have seen Labour members and an elected councillor exposed for sharing the propaganda of ultra-right groups. "This is in addition to another elected councillor branding Labour's own education policy as 'apartheid'." "Launching an investigation into the Llanelli Labour party is a welcome first step, but the party's head office must take swift and immediate action to stamp this out this type of divisive campaigning." A Welsh Labour spokeswoman said: "The Labour Party takes all complaints of this nature very seriously. The local party in Llanelli have made us aware of complaints and an investigation is under way."	Labour has launched an probe into complaints about members connected to a row over the move to change a primary school to Welsh-medium education.
The decision to call off the match was taken at 12:35 GMT following an inspection at Sportsdirect.com Park where part of the League One club's pitch was still frozen. The Latics are 22nd in the table and in the relegation places with Posh in sixth place. There has been no announcement as to when the fixture will be rearranged.	Oldham Athletic's League One fixture against Peterborough United has been postponed because of a frozen pitch.
The PRI is set to win about 30%, with the conservative National  Action Party on about 22%, said the head of the National Electoral Institute. On current projections, the PRI will see its number of seats drop slightly. The run-up to the poll was marked by violence with drug cartels blamed for the deaths of several candidates. On Sunday morning, protesters and parents of 43 students who disappeared last year burned election material in the town of Tixtla. They say they want answers about what happened to the students before elections are held. A dissident teachers' union also burned ballots and ransacked offices of political parties to express its anger at education reforms. Ahead of the elections, there was a great deal of pessimism - the feeling among many that votes do not really matter, politicians here are all the same, and violence will continue no matter what. But at a polling stations on Sunday, in relatively peaceful Mexico City, there was a sense of duty among many - that voting was the only way to make a difference. Asked what their main concern was and almost without exception, the response among voters was: 'Security.' People here are worried about where the country is heading. Despite President Pena Nieto's promises to restore peace in Mexico, these elections have proved otherwise. They have been some of the most violent in recent history. President Pena Nieto deployed federal police and troops to guard polling stations. His spokesman Eduard Sanchez said on Saturday: "Mexicans have the right to vote in peace... [we] will take all necessary measures within the framework of legality'' to protect the elections. Ahead of the polls opening, the CNTE teachers' union attacked the offices of five political parties in Chiapas state in the south of the country. In Guerrero state, explosive devices were thrown into a conservative party's office. Meanwhile in Oaxaca, as well as Guerrero, tens of thousands of ballot papers were burnt by protesters. A former mayor was shot dead outside a polling station in the same state. A number of candidates and numerous campaign workers have also been killed in drug-related violence.	Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto and his Institutional Revolutionary Party will keep control of Congress, preliminary election results suggest.
It had notified the UN of its intention to leave last October, saying the ICC pursued "regime change". The opposition Democratic Alliance then argued in court that the government had to first seek parliamentary approval. But it may not be the end of the government's bid to leave The Hague-based court. Justice Minister Michael Masutha was quoted as saying after the court ruling in February that the government would consider its options. In the meantime, according to a statement on the UN treaties website, the planned pull out has been officially cancelled. South Africa's original decision to pull out came after a dispute over Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir's visit to the country in 2015. The authorities refused to arrest Mr Bashir despite him facing an ICC arrest warrant over alleged war crimes. Mr Bashir was attending an AU summit in Johannesburg, when the government ignored an ICC request to arrest him. The ICC has been accused of being biased against Africans. The ICC and global justice: A non-binding African Union resolution agreed in January called for the mass withdrawal of member states from the court, with some countries accusing the ICC of undermining their sovereignty. The ICC denies the allegation, insisting it is pursuing justice for victims of war crimes in Africa. Last year, Burundi and The Gambia, along with South Africa, also said they would leave the court. But The Gambia, under new President Adama Barrow, has changed its mind.	South Africa has revoked its withdrawal from the International Criminal Court (ICC) after the High Court said the move was unconstitutional.

"This is the biggest event on the European Tour and there are a lot of benefits. I played really well today and had all the confidence going into the last couple of holes." An began the final round tied for the lead with Molinari and, despite picking up shots at the second and fourth, was only one ahead at the turn thanks to a hat-trick of birdies from Jaidee from the fifth. However, a birdie at the 11th and tap-in eagle at the 12th gave An a three-shot cushion that became four when Jaidee bogeyed the 13th. An made certain of victory with birdies on the 15th and 17th and a par on the last completed a hugely impressive performance from the Challenge Tour graduate. Bristol's Wood had a hole in one at the 14th, winning himself a car from the sponsors in the process.	South Korea's Byeong-hun An carded a final-round, seven-under-par 65 to win the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth.
Government sources told the BBC that the tribal fighters set fire to a building used by the militants. The source said 10 IS militants and five tribesmen had died in the clashes that followed. Issa al-Issawi, the exiled mayor of Fallujah, said that more tribesmen were joining the fight against IS. Reports said the violence involved men from multiple tribes and IS members known as al-Hisba, who are responsible for enforcing religious strictures in the city. "Clashes took place between sons of the al-Mahamda and al-Juraisat tribes against the al-Hisba group," Mr Issawi told AFP news agency. He said the violence stemmed from tensions over increasingly difficult living conditions while Fallujah is besieged by Iraqi security forces. Sheikh Majeed al-Juraisi, a leader in the al-Juraisat tribe, told AFP the clashes were part of an uprising against IS fighters in the city and called on the government and security forces to help. Reports suggested the tribesmen had seized parts of the north of the city, but later ceded the ground back to IS jihadists. Fallujah, which is about 50km (30 miles) west of Baghdad, has been held by anti-government forces since the beginning of 2014 and is now one of two Iraqi cities still under the IS group's control. IS militants launched a sweeping offensive in June 2014 that overran large areas north and west of Baghdad, but security forces and allied fighters have pushed the jihadists back with support from US-led air strikes.	Local tribesmen have reportedly clashed with fighters from the so-called Islamic State (IS) in the IS stronghold of Fallujah in western Iraq.
Some 1.57m sq km (600,000 sq miles) of the Southern Ocean will gain protection from commercial fishing for 35 years. Environmentalists have welcomed the move to protect what's said to be the Earth's most pristine marine ecosystem. They hope it will be the first of many such zones in international waters. At this meeting in Hobart, Australia, the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) agreed unanimously to designate the Ross Sea as an MPA, after years of protracted negotiations, New Zealand Foreign Minister Murray McCully announced. The Ross Sea, its shelf and slope only comprise 2% of the Southern Ocean but they are home to 38% of the world's Adelie penguins, 30% of the world's Antarctic petrels and around 6% of the world's population of Antarctic minke whales. The region is important to the rest of the planet as the upwelling of nutrients from the deep waters are carried on currents around the world. The Ross Sea is also home to huge numbers of krill, a staple food for species including whales and seals. Their oil is critical for salmon farming. However there are concerns that overfishing and climate change are having significant impacts on their numbers. The proposal, introduced by New Zealand and the US, and accepted by all the other nations, will see a general protection "no-take" zone where nothing can be removed including marine life and minerals. As part of the compromise that emerged in negotiations, there will be special zones where fishing from krill and toothfish will be allowed for research purposes. "I'm absolutely overjoyed," said Lewis Pugh, the UN Patron for the Oceans, and someone who has campaigned for years in support of this new MPA. "This is the biggest protected area on the land or the sea, this is the first large scale MPA on the high seas, they are largely unprotected." The ocean advocate and swimmer drew attention to the Ross Sea with a series of swims in the icy waters - and for two years he has engaged in a series of meetings, dubbed "speedo diplomacy" with Russian officials to convince them of the value of the MPA. At the end of negotiations last year, Russia was the one country holding out against a consensus on the Ross Sea. But this year there has been what Mr Pugh describes as an "environmental glasnost". Russia's President Vladimir Putin has designated 2017 as the Year of Ecology and the country has recently expanded an MPA around Franz Josef Land in the Arctic. Sergei Ivanov, President Putin's Special Representative for Ecology, welcomed the new deal. "Russia has a proud history of exploration and science in Antarctica. In this time of political turbulence in so many parts of the world, we are pleased to be part of this collaborative international effort to safeguard the Ross Sea," he said. One of the key questions in the negotiations was how long the MPA should last. China is on the record as stating it believes that 20 years is long enough for a designation. Many conservationists say this is far too short, given the lifespan of creatures that life in the Ross Sea, such as whales. Ultimately, the parties agreed on 35 years. The designation was welcomed not just by campaigners but also by those with close links to the Ross Sea. "The Ross family are euphoric that our family legacy has been honoured in the 175th anniversary year since James first discovered the Ross Sea," said Phillipa Ross, great, great, great granddaughter to Sir James Clark Ross, after whom the Ross Sea is named. One of the other big concerns that delayed the proposal was the fact that it could set a precedent for other high seas negotiations around the world, such as in the Arctic and in attempts by the UN to develop a new marine biodiversity treaty. Lewis Pugh is very hopeful that this will be the case. And he's willing to keep swimming until it happens. "This to me represents a first step, I am heading back down to the Antarctic peninsula to carry on swimming, I want to see a series of MPAs around this continent that I feel so much about," he explained. "For me this is an issue about justice - justice between generations. There seems to be something fundamentally wrong with us destroying our oceans so our children and grandchildren have absolutely nothing." Follow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathBBC and on Facebook.	Delegates from 24 countries and the European Union have agreed that the Ross Sea in Antarctica will become the world's largest marine protected area (MPA).
The list includes five from the UK and one American author, Tania James, for her novel The Tusk that Did the Damage. Poet Andrew McMillan's Physical won The Guardian First Book Award last year. The Swansea University-backed award will go to the best published literary work in English, written by an author aged 39 or under. Chair of the judges Prof Dai Smith called the works "eye-catching, eclectic and totally energising". The shortlisted writers are: A set of short stories set in Caerphilly by locally-born writer Thomas Morris was on the long list but did not make the final cut. The winner will be announced at a gala ceremony at Swansea University, which sponsors the prize, on International Dylan Thomas Day, 14 May.	The shortlist for the £30,000 Dylan Thomas Prize for young writers has been unveiled.
The former Superior General of Missionaries of Charity was suffering from various ailments. She took over the running of the charity after Mother Teresa died in 1997 and ran it for 12 years before Sister Mary Prema took over in 2009. The Missionaries of Charity cares for the homeless and dying in Kolkata. Archbishop of Kolkata Thomas D'Souza told the AFP news agency that Sister Nirmala "passed away peacefully, surrounded by sisters praying for her". "She had been suffering from a heart disease for quite some time, but she never lost her smile and was always cheerful." He said Sister Nirmala "carried forward Mother Teresa's legacy of compassion, gentleness, service to the poorest of the poor and holiness of life". "Even after she ceased to be head of Missionaries of Charity, she served the people with the same zeal as she did before." Reports say Sister Nirmala's body will be kept at the Missionaries of Charity headquarters in Kolkata and her funeral will be held on Wednesday afternoon. Prime Minister Narendra Modi led the tributes to the deceased nun. West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said she was "saddened" by Sister Nirmala's death. The Missionaries of Charity has about 4,500 nuns and hundreds of homes around the world.	Sister Nirmala, the nun who succeeded Mother Teresa as the head of a charity in the Indian city of Kolkata (Calcutta), has died, aged 81.
The prime minister "is committed to free school meals in England", an official spokesman told the BBC. The coalition government introduced the meals a year ago for all pupils in the first three years of school in England. But there has been speculation the meals are at risk, after Chancellor George Osborne demanded cuts of between 25% and 40% from unprotected budgets. The spokesman said the prime minister had made the point that "it was in the manifesto, the manifesto words are very clear - we're proud of what we've done with free school meals". The Conservative manifesto says: "We will support families by providing free meals to all infants". The chancellor called for the cuts in July, as part of his spending review, due to be published in November. The free school meals budget has cost about Â£600m each year, and there had been speculation over its future. But the Department for Education has indicated that free school meals will be protected in the spending review. "We believe that every child, regardless of their background, should have the same opportunities," said a spokesman. "That is at the heart of what we are doing with school food. "No child should be hindered because they are not eating a nutritious meal at lunchtime. "We have provided significant financial support to schools to help them deliver universal infant free school meals. "We have come a long way, and the new School Food Standards mean pupils of all ages are eating good food that sows the seeds for healthy eating for life." At the weekend some 40 top health professionals signed a letter warning that scrapping the meals could harm children's health. "It would be short-term thinking indeed for the government to cut the funding for universal infant free school meals," said the letter. The National Association of Head Teachers called for "a swift and unequivocal statement" from government that it would honour its general election pledge to fund a meal for all infant children. "That message could and should be delivered straight away," said NAHT general secretary, Russell Hobby. "Schools signing contracts with catering companies this term can't afford to wait until the November spending review only to find out the policy has been changed."	David Cameron has dismissed speculation free school meals for all infant children could face cuts.
Neil Aspin's promotion-chasing hosts have not lost in nine National League matches while Adam Lockwood's side are unbeaten in five. Guiseley went ahead on 15 minutes against the run of play when a throw-in found James Hurst who squared to Jake Lawlor to stroke into an empty net. Gateshead defender Liam Hogan superbly blocked Jordan Preston's effort and Guiseley keeper Jonny Maxted then saved well from Wesley York's shot just before the break. The hosts, who started the second half well, levelled on 62 minutes when a slip by half-time substitute Derek Asamoah let York curl sweetly into the top-right corner from the edge of the box.

Judge Thomas Lipps rejected arguments by defence lawyers that witnesses could face intimidation or harassment outside the courthouse in Steubenville. The case has attracted attention due to social media and the high profile of the football team in the small town. Judge Lipps also ruled the non-jury trial would be open to the public. He did so over the objections of the family of the 16-year-old girl who was allegedly attacked. She wanted to protect her identity and keep evidence that might eventually be ruled inadmissible from becoming public. Trenton Mays and Ma'lik Richmond, both 16, deny the charges they face next month at a juvenile court. Three other students who witnessed the alleged attack but were not charged are expected to testify at next month's trial. Those witnesses include two who took a video and photograph, then deleted the images. The Ohio attorney general's office told lawyers for those students last autumn that if the images had been found, they would have been charged. Prosecutors say the girl, who went to a school across the river from the city in West Virginia, was attacked after an alcohol-fuelled party last August. The case was thrust into the national spotlight after attention by bloggers and the hacker activist group Anonymous. Some claimed that the community had sought to cover up the alleged crime in order protect the two accused. The trial is set for 13 March.	An Ohio judge has ruled that the rape trial of two high school football players will take place in the county where the alleged attack happened.
Rhodri Colwyn Philipps, 50 - the 4th Viscount St Davids - wrote the message four days after Ms Miller won a Brexit legal challenge against the government. Chief magistrate Emma Arbuthnot said she had "no doubt it was menacing". Philipps, who called his comments "satire", faces a custodial sentence. He was found guilty of two counts of making malicious communications and acquitted of a third at Westminster Magistrates' Court. One of the counts related to a post regarding Ms Miller, published on Facebook on 7 November 2016, which said: "Â£5,000 for the first person to 'accidentally' run over this bloody troublesome first generation immigrant." Philipps, of Knightsbridge, London, described her as a "boat jumper" and added: "If this is what we should expect from immigrants, send them back to their stinking jungles." Ms Arbuthnot found this offence was racially aggravated. The court heard how Ms Miller, 52, said she felt "violated" by Philipps's "shocking" comments about her. Ms Miller led a successful legal challenge which, on 3 November, resulted in the government being told to consult Parliament before formally beginning the Brexit process. Philipps, who defended himself throughout the trial, said his posts had been simply reflecting how he and others felt following this ruling in the High Court. He told the court: "My family motto is 'Love of Country is my motivation'." He said his comments were "meant to be a form of satire, a literary technique, iterated in my personal style, which may not be to everyone's taste, but is understood and accepted by everyone who knows me". Ms Arbuthnot, in a series of exchanges with the peer, asked Philipps: "Boat jumper, how can I see that as anything other than a racial, ethnic aggravation?" But Philipps denied the allegation that his posts were "racially aggravated" saying that describing Ms Miller as a "boat jumper" and that she should go back to the "steaming jungle" were "statements of fact not a racist comment at all". He added that he would not have made any serious threat "on an account where I could easily be identified". He added he had deleted the posts as soon as he realised that his closed circle of Facebook friends had been "infiltrated" and screen shots of the posts had been passed to Ms Miller. Delivering her verdict, Ms Arbuthnot said there was "nothing private about a Facebook post". The other post Philipps was convicted for was in response to a news article about an immigrant in Luton, who was involved in a row over housing. Philipps wrote: "I will open the bidding. Â£2,000 in cash for the first person to carve Arnold Sube into pieces." Kate Mulholland, from the Crown Prosecution Service said: "No-one should have these kind of menacing comments made to them or about them." Philipps will be sentenced later this week.	An aristocrat who wrote an online post offering Â£5,000 to anyone who ran over businesswoman Gina Miller has been found guilty of two charges of making menacing communications.
His lawyer Brian Webber told the AFP news agency that a decision over his early release has been referred back to the parole board. The Paralympic star was jailed for five years in 2014 for the culpable homicide of Reeva Steenkamp. He has been fighting a lengthy battle to be released early from jail. Pistorius was due to be released in August, but remained in prison after Justice Minister Michael Masutha made a last-minute intervention blocking it. The parole review board - the final recourse for parole disputes - met on Monday to decide if the star, 28, should be allowed out on house arrest. A definitive parole ruling is now unlikely to be made before the athlete in a separate legal process appeals against his conviction on 3 November in Bloemfontein. This ruling could result in him receiving a longer prison term. Mr Webber explained that the parole review board decided to refer the matter back to the original parole panel - the body accused by Mr Masutha of "prematurely" wanting to release him in August. There will not be much sympathy for Pistorius because many people felt that the judge erred by acquitting him of murder. The double amputee will have to remain behind bars because while his case joins the lengthy queue of other parole hearings that need to be heard, and there is no indication when this will happen. Legal experts say the decision by the justice minister Michael Masutha to intervene was correct in terms of the law. At the time of his intervention, Pistorius had been granted parole only six months into his five-year sentence. The law states clearly that an offender can only be considered for parole after serving one-sixth of his sentence, in this case 10 months. But because he has now served one-sixth of his sentence, he probably should be released by now. Prosecutors argue that the judge who presided over his trial did not apply the law correctly by acquitting him of murder. The judge instead found him guilty of a lesser charge of culpable homicide - equivalent to manslaughter. Reeva Steenkamp's parents are strongly against Pistorius' possible release, telling an Australian TV channel in August that the Paralympian has ruined their lives. "He killed her. He admits he killed her. She's dead. Why didn't he just let her walk away? Why?" Reeva's mother June Steenkamp asked in the interview.	Oscar Pistorius must remain in jail and not be transferred to house arrest after a decision to grant him parole was again delayed.
DUP leader, First Minister Arlene Foster, has resisted both calls to step aside and calls to resign over the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) scheme. RHI is approximately £490m over budget. Sinn Féin's national chairperson Declan Kearney accused Mrs Foster and her party of "unvarnished arrogance" over the "growing political crisis". Writing in the the republican newspaper, An Phoblacht, Mr Kearney said: "It's increasingly obvious the DUP have lost the run of themselves within the northern political institutions." He repeated an earlier call by his party colleague Martin McGuinness that Mrs Foster should step aside as first minister to "allow a time-framed, comprehensive, independent investigation" into the heating scheme. The DUP leader set up the RHI scheme in 2012 when she was minister for enterprise, trade and investment. Last month she apologised for its lack of cost controls but defended her own role in the scheme. Sinn Féin and the DUP lead a power-sharing coalition government at Stormont, with the support of Justice Minister Claire Sugden, an independent MLA. However, relationships have been under increased strain as the full implications for the public purse of the botched RHI scheme have been revealed. Mr Kearney's article also criticised the DUP and its Communities Minister Paul Givan for last week's decision to withdraw funding for an Irish language bursary scheme. The Líofa (fluent) Gaeltacht bursary scheme enabled at least 100 people a year to attend summer Irish language classes in the Donegal gaeltacht. The funding cut was announced by Mr Givan's department two days before Christmas. Mr Kearney wrote: "The political process has now been dragged recklessly by the DUP, culminating with the RHI crisis towards an unprecedented tipping point. "Political institutions cease to have value when they do not reflect equality, mutual respect and parity of esteem, and have become detached from the lives of citizens they are meant to serve. "Playing fast and loose with the political process and the political institutions is unsustainable. "There are big decisions to make, and there is very little time." However, Sinn Féin was criticised by the SDLP for not supporting its call for a public inquiry into the RHI scandal. SDLP MLA Patsy McGlone said: "Surrendering the demand for a judge-led public inquiry is surrendering the need for transparency, accountability and consequences for the loss of hundreds of millions in public money. "With trust in our hard-won institutions at stake, Sinn Féin need to think very carefully on where their loyalties lie. The SDLP have been clear, only a judge-led inquiry can get to the truth of this matter."	Sinn Féin has accused the DUP of dragging the political process "towards an unprecedented tipping point" over the 'cash-for-ash' scandal.
Norman Rimmington, also known as "Rimmo", signed with Barnsley in 1945, earning £3 a week as a goalkeeper. He worked for the football club in many roles after he hung up his gloves, including coach, assistant manager, groundsman, physio and kit man. Fans of the club applauded as the funeral procession passed the Tykes' Oakwell stadium. Mr Rimmington, who was born in Staincross, was described by the club as a "fearless" keeper who made 27 appearances for the side, before moving to Hartlepool United in 1947. The goalkeeper, who also worked as a pit fitter and a mechanic, returned to the South Yorkshire side in 1952 and never left. He died in late December aged 93. Family members, friends, colleagues and former team-mates attended a service at All Saints Church, Darton, followed by a ceremony at Barnsley Crematorium. In an interview with BBC Sport, Mr Rimmington said he "used to get some stick as a goalkeeper" during his playing days. "They could knock you into back of net and it were a goal; it's not the same game," he said. "Now they go down as if they've been shot and there's nothing wrong with them." Shortly before his death, he was informed he had been awarded the British Empire Medal for services to football. Discussing his deep connection with the club, he said: "I were born in Barnsley, brought up in Barnsley and played at Barnsley. "I love the club and everything I've done here." In a statement, the club said: "Rimmo was a true club legend and a man who represented the club with the upmost pride and dedication throughout his life." •Born: 29 Nov 1923, Staincross, near Barnsley •Occupations outside football: Pit fitter and mechanic •1946-47: Barnsley FC (27 appearances) •1947-52: Hartlepool Utd (127 appearances) •1952-61: Barnsley 'A' team coach •1961-1972: Head coach and physio •1972-1978: Groundsman and physio •1978-1980: Assistant manager and physio •1980-1985: Physio •1985-2016: Kitman and laundry	The funeral of a "club legend" who worked for Barnsley FC for more than 65 years has been held.
Spurs chairman Daniel Levy this week defended a lack of signings and railed against "unsustainable" spending. They were runners up to Chelsea in the Premier League last term, faltered in the Champions League group stages, and again in the Europa League last 32. "If [Spurs] don't win the title, it's not a tragedy," said Conte. "If they don't arrive in the Champions League, it's not a tragedy. If they go out in the first round of the Champions League, it's not a tragedy. If they go out after the first game that they play in the Europa League, it's not a tragedy. "Maybe for Chelsea, Arsenal, Manchester City, Manchester United and - I don't know - Liverpool, it is a tragedy. You must understand the status of the team. "Every team has to understand what their ambitions are. If their ambitions are to fight for the title or win the Champions League, you must buy expensive players. Otherwise you continue to stay in your level. It's simple." "My question is this: What are Tottenham's expectations?" After finishing second in the Premier League last season, Spurs have not added to their squad over the summer. Their only transfer activity has been selling England right-back Kyle Walker to rivals Manchester City for £45m. "We have a duty to manage the club appropriately," Levy said. Recent history suggests it may be a while before Levy makes his move, with the majority of Spurs' incoming deals finalised in August in the past few seasons. Last August, they paid Newcastle £30m for midfielder Moussa Sissoko in the final few hours of the window, having signed £9m winger Georges-Kevin Nkoudou and loan goalkeeper Pau Lopez earlier in the day. In previous seasons, forward Son Heung-min (£22m), midfielder Erik Lamela (£25.7m), goalkeeper Hugo Lloris (£11.8m) and forward Clint Dempsey (£6m) all joined the club in the closing days and hours of transfer windows. More than £850m has been spent by Premier League sides so far in the summer transfer window, which closes on 31 August, with accountancy firm Deloitte predicting top-flight clubs will surpass the record £1.165bn they spent last summer. Chelsea have parted with about £130m for three players - forward Alvaro Morata from Real Madrid, midfielder Tiemoue Bakayoko from Monaco and defender Antonio Rudiger from Roma. Conte revealed Chelsea "tried to buy" Walker and acknowledged that the market is currently "very difficult", adding: "I think now every single player is expensive." Conte also said Spurs and England striker Harry Kane would be his first pick if he could sign any forward. Kane has finished as the Premier League's top goalscorer for the past two seasons. "Tottenham is a really good squad if they are able to keep all the players," Conte said. "For me, Kane, now, is one of the best strikers in the world. "If I had to buy one striker I would go to Kane. He is a complete striker. He is strong physically, with the ball, without the ball, he fights and he's strong in the air and acrobatic on the right and the left. "If you go to buy Kane now it would be at least £100m."	Chelsea manager Antonio Conte has questioned Tottenham's ambition, suggesting they have lower expectations than their Premier League title rivals.
The 19-year-old has been with the Shakers since 2013 and scored two goals in 14 appearances last season. However, he can return to Gigg Lane if Bury use the recall clause in his contract, which expires on 28 April. He has had previous loan spells with National League North side Stalybridge Celtic and Norway's Bergsoy IL.	Macclesfield Town have signed midfielder Scott Burgess on a season-long loan deal from League One club Bury.
Waites thrashed Jeff Smith 7-1 in Sunday's final at Lakeside. The 38-year-old from Huddersfield had an operation on a rotator cuff problem in February. "I had six weeks without throwing a dart - that's painful in itself. Now I'm taking the world title back home," he told BBC Sport. "It's hard trying to come back from an injury and trying to get yourself to practice. Sometimes, no matter what you do, your body won't react with it." Waites, who added to his previous Lakeside success from 2013, continued: "This week, I've prepared myself to play for two hours in a session and it's so difficult to do. My shoulder and my body wasn't happy with that. "After I played Glen Durrant [in the quarter-finals on Friday] I ended up going to sleep at half past eight." Media playback is not supported on this device Waites, who was the ninth seed, is the eighth man to win the BDO title on more than one occasion. He raced into a 5-0 lead in the final against unseeded Canadian Smith, 40, and eventually wrapped up a comfortable victory. "It's not really sunk in yet," said Waites, who will return to his job as a carpenter on Tuesday. "I can't believe it was over so quickly. I set myself up for it being a really tough game and Jeff, although he pushed me a little bit, didn't take his opportunities. "I took my opportunities when I got them and I was taking sets."	Scott Waites was delighted to clinch a second BDO world title, admitting it seemed "a million miles away" following shoulder surgery last year.
Donald Trump, Jeb Bush and Scott Walker will take the stage in Cleveland on Thursday night with seven rivals. Fox News selected the 10 most popular Republicans based on five national polls, excluding Mr Perry and South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham. Those two and five other candidates will take part in an earlier debate. Former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum reacted angrily to his omission. "The idea that they have left out the runner-up for the 2012 nomination [Santorum], the former four-term governor of Texas [Perry], the governor of Louisiana [Bobby Jindal], the first female Fortune 50 CEO [Carly Fiorina], and the 3-term Senator from South Carolina [Graham] due to polling seven months before a single vote is cast is preposterous," his spokesman said. In contrast, Mr Perry tweeted that he was looking forward to being on Fox at 5pm for "a serious exchange of ideas and positive solutions to get America back on track". The main debate takes place four hours later at 9pm local time (01:00 GMT). All eyes will be on hotel tycoon Mr Trump, who leads the polls and has made headlines with outspoken remarks about many of his rivals. A fun guide to the 10 Republican debaters One of the Republican frontrunners, Jeb Bush, became embroiled in a row with leading Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton over women's health funding on Tuesday.

Latest figures show the the nursing and midwifery vacancy rate stands at 4.5% - the highest ever reported. The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) said the current situation with unfilled posts threatened patient care. Health Secretary Shona Robison insisted staff levels within the NHS had risen to "historically high levels" under the SNP. Figures from ISD Scotland show 2,818.9 whole-time equivalent (WTE) posts were unfilled at the end of March, a 27.5% increase from March last year. The number of such posts lying unfilled for three months or more was up 51.3% year on year to 670.6. During the same period, the NHS spent Â£8.4m more on nursing and midwifery bank and agency staff, paying out a total of Â£166.5m. Vacancies for consultants have also risen year on year from 6.5% to 7.4% and there were 415.7 vacancies, of which 203.4 have lain empty for more than three months, up 38.2 from 2016. The total number of staff working within the Scottish NHS, however, has risen 0.7% year on year to 139,430 WTE posts. Norman Provan of the RCN warned: "If there aren't the nurses, patients won't receive the care they need." He added: "These figures reflect the challenge faced by Scotland's NHS. Across both acute and community settings, there are simply too few nurses. "The Scottish government can point to the increase in the number of nursing and midwifery staff, but the reality on the ground is that nurses wanting to do their very best for patients are too often coming up against the reality of vacancies in the workforce. "Nursing morale is low and teams are struggling to recruit and retain the staff they need." Health Secretary Ms Robison said part of the increase in vacancies was due to the creation of new posts in health boards. She said: "Under this government, NHS staff numbers have risen to historically high levels, with more doctors and nursing staff now delivering care for the people of Scotland - including over 2,000 additional qualified nurses and midwives. "We're committed to training and retaining our nursing staff, and earlier this year we confirmed a 4.7% increase in trainee nurses and midwives for 2017/18 - a fifth successive rise. "We have also committed Â£450,000 over three years to reintroduce a national return to practice scheme."	Nursing leaders are warning the NHS in Scotland has "too few nurses" after vacancies rose to record levels.
Ministers and other government officials are being given a three-month deadline to hand over state-owned homes and vehicles, from the date of the new president's inauguration. The law targets presidential appointees who try to cling on to the perks of office after a new leader is elected. Ghana goes to the polls on 7 December. After previous transfers of power, some officials have had to be forcibly evicted and had their state-owned vehicles seized after failing to hand them back. The law does not apply to presidents and vice-presidents as we earlier reported. The bill, which was passed by MPs on Wednesday evening, will now go to the president to sign into law. Existing legislation requires officials to hand back government property after they leave office, but this is the first time a strict time limit has been applied. Ghana's current leader John Mahama is standing for re-election and his main opponent is Nana Akufo-Addo. The winner will be inaugurated on 7 January 2017. Ghana's presidential candidates:	Outgoing ministers in Ghana could be forcibly evicted from their official residences if they fail to move out in time, under new laws.
More than 20 people are being treated in hospital with burns and other injuries after the incident in the village of Hitrino, local media say. The authorities ordered an evacuation as firefighters battled the blaze. At least 20 buildings were damaged in the derailment and explosion, spokesperson Nikolay Nikolov told Bulgaria's Nova television. Two tanks hit an electricity line and exploded when the train derailed near the village station at about 05:30 local time (03:30 GMT), according to several reports. "Two blasts have caused a serious fire and ruined at least 20 buildings," Interior Ministry Chief Secretary Georgi Kostov told Reuters news agency. "There are many people injured... many with burns." Hitrino, a town of around 800 people, is located in Bulgaria's north-eastern Shumen province, about 60 miles (100km) from the Black Sea. Bulgarian Prime Minister Boiko Borisov said he was travelling to the village. In a post on social media, he said the regional hospital needed blood supplies to cope with the causalities, and appealed to people in the region to donate blood. Transport Minister Ivalyo Moskovski also said he was travelling to the village. In a brief statement, he said he had ordered both the head of the railway accident investigation task force and a representative of the rail infrastructure company to attend the scene.	A train carrying liquid petroleum gas has derailed and exploded in Bulgaria, killing at least four people.
Almost completely cut off for centuries, it has tried to let in some aspects of the outside world while fiercely guarding its ancient traditions. The Bhutanese name for Bhutan, Druk Yul, means "Land of the Thunder Dragon" and it only began to open up to outsiders in the 1970s. The Wangchuck hereditary monarchy has wielded power since 1907. But Bhutan became a two-party parliamentary democracy after elections in March 2008. Population 750,000 Area 38,364 sq km (14,812 sq miles) Major language Dzongkha Major religions Buddhism (official), Hinduism Life expectancy 66 years (men), 70 years (women) Currency ngultrum Head of state: King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck succeeded his father, Jigme Singye Wangchuck, in December 2006 after the former monarch announced his abdication. His predecessor had already given up some of his absolute powers in 1998 and ruled in conjunction with the government, an assembly and a royal advisory council. Prime Minister: Tshering Tobgay Tshering Tobgay was elected Bhutan's second prime minister in July 2013, succeeding Jigme Yozer Thinley. He is president of the People's Democratic Party. He was leader of the opposition in the National Assembly from March 2008 to April 2013. He has projected himself as a reformer, rejecting official limousine and prime ministerial accommodation. Television did not come to Bhutan until 1999. For years, the country cut itself off, fearing that outside influences would undermine its monarchy and culture. Radio broadcasting began in 1973 and the internet arrived in 1999. Some key dates in the history of Bhutan: 1720 - Chinese imperial army invades and temporarily establishes control over Bhutan. 1772-73 - British intervention. 1864-65 - Further intervention by Britain. 1907 - Ugyen Wangchuck is chosen as hereditary ruler. 1910 - Treaty giving Britain control over foreign relations. 1949 - Treaty signed with newly-independent India guaranteeing non-interference in Bhutan's internal affairs, but allowing Delhi influence over foreign relations. 1958 - Slavery abolished. 1974 - First foreign tourists allowed in. 1990 - Thousands of Hindus flee to Nepal following clashes. 1998 - King cedes some powers to national assembly.	Bhutan is a tiny and remote kingdom nestling in the Himalayas between its powerful neighbours, India and China.
Redknapp has added goalkeeper David Stockdale, defender Marc Roberts and midfielder Cheikh N'Doye this summer. Ravel Morrison and Simeon Slavchev also remain on trial with the club, but the Blues manager wants more additions before the season begins on Saturday. "We're a little bit short at the moment - we need to improve the squad this week if we can," he told BBC WM. "We've been trying, but it's been very difficult to get the players in who we've been chasing. Hopefully we'll get there - it's not been through lack of effort." Redknapp confirmed an interest in Bristol City's Aden Flint, who may be available following the arrival of Nathan Baker from Aston Villa. "I like him but we'll only pay what we can - if he's too expensive then we'll move on," he said. Following the 2-0 friendly loss to Swansea on Saturday, Redknapp also said defender Ryan Shotton could leave if the club's valuation is met. If Shotton were to go that would leave Birmingham, who missed out on John Terry to rivals Villa, with just two centre-backs going into the opening game of the Championship season at Ipswich on Saturday. "I'm not frustrated. I'm just desperate to do well, but I need the tools to be able to do that," Redknapp said. "If I get the tools I'll do that, if I don't then it's going to be difficult."	Birmingham City will face a "difficult" season if they cannot sign new players this week, says manager Harry Redknapp.
Sixth seed Wozniacki, the champion in 2010, saw off unseeded American Stephens 6-2 6-3 in the first semi-final in Toronto. Defending champion Simona Halep was thrashed 6-1 6-1 by Ukraine's Elina Svitolina in the second semi-final. The pair played twice in the day after rain disrupted the schedule. Svitolina lost the first set against Wimbledon champion Garbine Muguruza before the rain arrived on Friday night, and the fifth seed fought back on Saturday to win 4-6 6-4 6-3. Romanian second seed Halep swept past France's Caroline Garcia 6-4 6-2 in the last of the quarter-finals. None of Wozniacki's 25 career titles have been won this year - losing all five finals she has played in 2017. "I had one year where I went to six finals and I won all of them," she said. "I guess it's a give and take sometimes and just that I keep myself in these situations is awesome." Svitolina said she was "a little bit tired" after the rain affected her schedule, but is ready for the final. "I didn't expect this type of day but I'm very happy that I could stay very focused," she said. "Yeah, I'm very happy."	Denmark's Caroline Wozniacki will try to win her first title of 2017 after reaching her sixth final with victory over Sloane Stephens at the Rogers Cup.
President Juan Manuel Santos said the authorities do not know how many people are still missing. Heavy rains caused the river Liboriana, in the town of Salgar, to burst its banks, triggering the landslide. Much of the village of Santa Margarita, south-west of the provincial capital, Medellin, was swept away when the disaster hit early on Monday. Rescue teams and residents have got together to dig through rouble in the hope of finding survivors. After visiting the scene of the disaster, Mr Santos declared a state of emergency and promised to rebuild the houses. "We cannot bring the dead back, which we regret deeply, and we will support the families (of the victims)," said Mr Santos earlier. "But we have to move on from this tragedy, and look ahead with courage and fortitude." "The priority now is the hospital," said the president. Earlier on Monday, gas and electricity services in the town were suspended as a precautionary measure. The Colombian Air Force and police have sent helicopters to the area. More than 160 soldiers are working in the emergency effort. Some 100 people have been evacuated from high-risk areas. Local official Zulma Osorio spoke of a "tragedy of enormous proportions". Mud, rocks and tree trunks destroyed many houses in poor neighbourhoods close to the river. Resident Jorge Quintero described his ordeal when the landslide hit the village: "When I felt my house shaking we got out, my family and me. When we got out, we were stuck in the middle of the landslide, it was coming from both sides and we were in the middle. "I said to my wife, let's hold each other and hope that God saves us and I know he gave us his hand because here we are, alive, still frightened, but still alive." More rain is expected in the are in the next few days.	More than 50 people have been killed in a landslide in Antioquia province in north-west Colombia, officials say.
The Team Dimension Data rider, 33, timed his push perfectly on the final climbs of the 194.5km stage from Bradford to Fox Valley near Sheffield. Pauwels' team-mate Omar Fraile finished second and Britain's Tao Geoghegan-Hart, riding for Team Sky, was fifth. Nacer Bouhanni, Saturday's stage winner, was taken to hospital after being knocked unconscious in a crash. Pauwels attacked at the top of the Cote de Wigtwizzle, with 22km remaining, then eked out a 30-second lead on the Cote de Ewden Height. The chasing pack narrowed that advantage to nine seconds by the summit of the final climb out of Midhopestones but Pauwels eased clear again to claim victory. "It feels a bit strange," Pauwels said. "It is the first time I have had my hands in the air. "But I think people would not really be surprised that I take a win because I have been quite close. "Last year I was second, third, fourth, everything except a win, and now I get two wins at the same time which makes it more special." Men's Tour de Yorkshire, stage three result: 1.

Media playback is not supported on this device Ulster twice opened a seven-point lead through tries by wing Craig Gilroy and full-back Jared Payne. In a week when the Welsh Rugby Union announced they intend to take over the region, Dragons hit back with scores by Rynard Landman and Ollie Griffiths. Paddy Jackson's kick edged Ulster ahead before Rodney Ah You was shown a red card and Andrew claimed the key try. Ah You was dismissed after he was adjudged to have made an illegal shoulder charge on Dragons full-back Carl Meyer. The win means Ulster stay fourth in the Pro12 table, but their failure to gain a bonus point means fifth-placed Scarlets have reduced their cushion to three points with four matches remaining. Playing for the last time this season at Rodney Parade, Dragons were dominated in the early stages and were seven points down within 10 minutes thanks to Ruan Pienaar's vision and Gilroy's footwork. The South African scrum half's kick into space bounced horribly for the defenders and Gilroy dribbled the ball into space and touched down near the posts. The Welsh region dominated possession for the rest of the half, at one stage going through 32-phases, but never really looking likely to score a try. O'Brien's penalty was cancelled out by Pienaar with Carl Meyer' long-range penalty off target to leave Ulster with a seven-point half-time lead. A debatable yellow card for Gilroy gave the Dragons a bridgehead which Landman turned into points with a rumbling lineout drive. O'Brien's conversion levelled the scores. But before the Ulster wing had returned to the field of play full-back Payne cut a clever line to cross for his side's second try. Dragons, in 10th-place in the table, again hit back with flanker Griffiths charging down a clearance and being given the benefit of considerable double and awarded the try after several TV replays. Jackson's penalty with eight minutes remaining edged Ulster back ahead before Ah You' careless challenge reduced his team to 14-men with six minutes remaining. Ulster rallied and kicked for the corner with Andrew claiming the crucial try from the driving lineout.

Alice Pyne, 17, of Ulverston, died of Hodgkin's lymphoma in 2013 after publishing her wish list. Haley McTaggart, 33, admitted getting her charity Alice's Escapes to pay Â£2,000 for her to go on a trek to Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania. McTaggart admitted fraud and was jailed for 10 months suspended for two years. The court also heard how McTaggart sold raffle tickets for a false raffle and never handed over the money. She also told the charity that she was unable to transfer money after the trip to Tanzania. Sentencing McTaggart, Recorder John Corless said she had committed an "unpleasant and serious" offence. Alice's Escapes was founded in 2012 by Miss Payne who 16 at the time. The teenager wanted to provide holidays in Cumbria for seriously ill children and their families. The top item on her bucket list was the hope that everyone in the UK would sign up as a bone marrow donor, an aspiration which Prime Minister David Cameron praised in the House of Commons. It is estimated that about 40,000 people signed up as donors as a direct result of her appeal. Miss Pyne and her sister Milly raised more than Â£100,000.	A Whitehaven woman who defrauded a charity set up by a teenager dying of cancer who became well-known for her "bucket list" has been sentenced.
Scottish Hydro-Electric Transmission Ltd, a division of energy giant SSE, submitted the "needs case" as part of the planning process for the cable. After assessing the case, energy regulator Ofgem has asked for further details to be submitted. The project has been hit by delays and a rise in costs to an estimated Â£780m. Islands local authority, Comhairle nan Eilean Siar, has said major renewable energy projects planned for the isles cannot go ahead without the cable. The interconnector would export electricity to the mainland for distribution. It would stretch to about 50 miles (80km) from Gravir on Lewis to Ullapool on the north-west coast of mainland Scotland. The Scottish government has been involved in talks on the project. A spokesperson said: "This is a matter for SSE and Ofgem, but we would encourage the company and regulator to move swiftly to resolve this issue. "Improved grid connections will enable the huge renewable energy resources of Scotland's islands to create jobs - up to 3,500 jobs in the Western Isles, almost 2,900 in the Shetlands and over 4,500 in the Orkney Islands by 2030. The spokesperson added: "SSE put a business case for the Western Isles link to the electricity regulator Ofgem on 14 June, and today Ofgem have responded by setting out the detailed further information they require."	Ofgem has asked for more information on why a subsea cable is needed to carry electricity generated on the Western Isles to the mainland.
After going down to 12 men, following Ben Flower's red card, Wigan scored 21 unanswered points to triumph. The Warriors have lost the past two Super League deciders at Old Trafford. "We will take a lot of confidence coming into the back end of the year when confidence is important going into big games," Smith said. Victory when the Catalans Dragons visit the DW Stadium next week would guarantee Wigan a home semi-final, while their hopes of clinching the League Leaders' Shield are slim as Warrington travel to second-placed Hull FC. Warrington only need a draw to win the first piece of Super League silverware this season. "We are looking just to win the game next week. Whatever comes of it, being first or second, gets us a home semi and that is what we want," Smith told BBC Radio Manchester. "We want to get to Old Trafford and want to win. We've had a disappointing couple of years, and it is all about progressing now and putting in a performance next week." If Wigan do reach the final for a fourth successive season, they may be without Flower after his elbow on Declan Patton saw him sent off with 23 minutes remaining on Friday. It was the prop's first dismissal since receiving an early red card in Wigan's Grand Final defeat by St Helens in 2014. A man down and with the League Leaders' Shield being made ready for presentation to Wolves, the visitors produced a remarkable turnaround from 28-14 down in the second half. Josh Charnley touched town twice and Lewis Tierney completed a brace of his own before Smith edged Wigan ahead with a drop goal. Anthony Gelling's late try put the result beyond doubt. "As soon as we got the first try when Benny got sent off I think the belief was there to go on and do something special," Smith said. "When you come to stadiums like this and get results like that, it gives you a massive lift."	Wigan have the confidence to go on and win the Super League Grand Final after overcoming leaders Warrington on Friday, says half-back Matty Smith.
Hassan Nasrallah said Syria's opposition was too weak to bring down Bashar al-Assad's regime militarily. He was speaking in an address broadcast on Hezbollah's TV station al-Manar. BBC Arab affairs analyst Sebastian Usher says the speech tacitly confirmed the group has been involved in fighting in neighbouring Syria. The Syrian opposition has long claimed the Iranian-backed Shia movement has been supplying fighters to help Mr Assad, a key Hezbollah backer. "A large number [of rebels] were preparing to capture villages inhabited by Lebanese... so it was normal to offer every possible and necessary aid to help the Syrian army,"  Mr Nasrallah was quoted as saying by AFP news agency. The Hezbollah leader said it had never hidden its martyrs, but that reports that large numbers of its fighters had been killed were lies. He also warned that if a key Shia shrine south of Damascus - that named after Sayida Zeinab, a granddaughter of Prophet Muhammad - were to be destroyed, it would spark revenge that could get out of control. "If the shrine is destroyed things will get out of control," he said. Mr Nasrallah tried to reassure his domestic audience that - above all - Hezbollah wanted to avoid the Syrian war coming to Lebanon, adds our correspondent, but many there may find little to comfort them in this latest show of defiance. The announcement came hours after 14 people were killed by a powerful explosion in Damascus, and a day after Syrian Prime Minister Wael al-Halqi survived a car bomb attack in the Syrian capital. Government forces and rebels have been fighting in and around Damascus for months, but neither have gained the upper hand. More than 70,000 people have been killed since fighting between Syrian forces and rebels erupted in March 2011.	The head of Lebanese militant group Hezbollah has declared that Syria has real friends who will not let it fall to the US, Israel or Islamic radicals.
The former UKIP leader will provide political analysis for the main channel, and the Fox Business Network's daytime and primetime programmes. Mr Farage has been one of the UK's most prominent supporters of US President Donald Trump and appeared alongside him during his election campaign. He was the first UK politician to meet Mr Trump after his win in November. It comes shortly after he was given his own nightly show on UK radio station LBC. Mr Farage travelled to Washington for Mr Trump's inauguration on Friday. After the ceremony he tweeted his approval saying: "A very strong speech by @POTUS. He means it." He also appeared on Fox Business to comment on the inauguration. He said: "Listening to the speech today, this is a political revolution and it's very exciting." Mr Farage has said he wants to be a "bridge" between the UK and Donald Trump's US administration. The US president tweeted in November that Mr Farage would make a good British ambassador to the US but Downing Street rejected the suggestion, saying there was "no vacancy".	Nigel Farage has been hired as a commentator for American TV network Fox News, the broadcaster has announced.
The Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) said mosques would offer refreshments and "insight" into how they run. Leaders from other religions have also been invited, to "demonstrate unity". The MCB has raised concerns about anti-Muslim sentiment since 17 people were killed by Islamist militants in Paris last month. Announcing Visit My Mosque Day, the MCB said: "Mosques will be sharing tea and refreshments alongside an insight into the day-to-day goings on of a busy Muslim centre of worship. Members of the Muslim community "may be on hand to answer questions about Muslims and Islam where this is possible," it said. "Local mosques will also be inviting inter-faith leaders as well, and all will be invited to come together to demonstrate unity and solidarity during what has been a tense time for faith communities." Speaking outside the East London Mosque in Whitechapel, MCB assistant secretary general Miqdaad Versi said the organisation wanted to "de-mystify what Islam, Muslims and mosques are all about". "People can have the opportunity to understand these things directly from people that they can speak to, and by actually experiencing these institutions and coming into mosques they can break down the barriers that they previously had," he said. Mr Versi said there had been a rise in "Islamophobia" since the Paris killings, with attacks on three or four mosques, more verbal attacks against Muslims and "a lot more hate mail" being received by the MCB. "For us it's important to try and create a positive image, and not let the actions of a few impact the reality of the many," he added. The Reverend Fred Ashford-Okai, one of those who visited East London Mosque earlier, said: "The more we know about each other - Muslims, Christians, Jews, even those with no faith - the more we can actually live a more cohesive life in our community." More than 20 mosques were expected to take part. The figure is a small proportion of the total number of mosques in Britain, which is estimated to be 1,750. The MCB said only 55-60% of mosques were affiliated to it, and the total includes small establishments such as prayer rooms in schools and offices.	Mosques have opened their doors to the public as part of a drive to "reach out to fellow Britons following tensions around terrorism".

At least 100 others were wounded in the strike, which reportedly struck a warehouse containing weapons. The commando unit is allied with Houthi rebels whose military capabilities the coalition has been trying to destroy. Casualties were also reported after air strikes in the northern province of Hajjah, near the Saudi border. Residents of the Bakeel al-Meer area told the Reuters news agency that at least 40 people had been killed, mostly civilians. "Houthi gunmen were attacking Saudi border positions from this area but the coalition's planes failed to hit the fighters and bombed civilians [instead]," one resident alleged. Hours after the air strikes in Hajjah, coalition warplanes targeted the headquarters of the Special Security Forces in the southern Sabaain district of Sanaa. Officials from the rebel-controlled health ministry said that 36 soldiers and officers had been killed. However, a commando who survived the attack suggested that civilians might also have been among the victims. "There were many people at the entrance to the warehouse, getting their weapons, farmers, cooks [and also soldiers]; these poor people were standing at the entrance to the warehouse," he told Reuters. Other air strikes on Wednesday severely damaged a rebel-controlled naval base in the western province of Hudaydah, on Yemen's Red Sea coast. A rebel-held military base outside Dhalea was also hit, a day after militiamen allied to the exiled government were reported to have taken control of the southern city. The World Health Organization's director general, Dr Margaret Chan, said on Wednesday that two months of air strikes and fighting on the ground had left up to 2,000 people dead and 8,000 wounded, including hundreds of women and children. Almost 7.5 million people are in urgent need of medical help. "Hospitals around the country are closing down their emergency operations rooms and intensive care units due to shortages in staff and fuel for generators," Dr Chan warned. "The health and lives of millions of people are at risk." The UN has been trying to reschedule peace talks in Geneva that were planned for this week, but the government has insisted the Houthis recognise its authority, withdraw from cities they control and disarm before being allowed to participate.	Saudi-led coalition warplanes have bombed a special forces camp in Yemen's capital, Sanaa, killing at least 36 people, officials and witnesses say.
Surrey County Council leader David Hodge said the government had cut its annual grant by £170m since 2010. The proposed increase would add nearly £200 to a Band D bill, bringing it to about £1,500. The government said if the proposed budget is set, taxpayers would have the final say in a referendum. Any authority wanting to increase council tax by more than 2% must put the plans to a vote. This would take place on 4 May, alongside local elections, and would include a vote in Chancellor Philip Hammond's constituency of Runnymede and Weybridge. Opposition councillors in Surrey said the increase would be unaffordable for many residents and it followed financial failings by the council and the government's failure to fund services properly. Council tax analysis - Pete Sherlock, BBC News data journalist We can't say what the average rises are set to be this year, as not all local authorities have declared their intentions. However, last year the average Band D council tax set by local authorities in England for 2016-17 was £1,530. This was an increase of £46 - or 3.1% on the 2015-16 figure of £1,484 -  and 1.6% of that was the adult social care precept. So Surrey's rise is five times last year's average. This shows how council tax hikes were brought down post 2008, but are now on the rise again. Mr Hodge said the council had to set a budget for 2017-18 that would protect vital services. He said: "The government has cut our annual grant by £170m since 2010, leaving a huge gap in our budget. "Demand for adult social care, learning disabilities and children's services is increasing every year. "So I regret, despite us finding £450m worth of savings from our annual budget, we have no choice but to propose this increase in council tax." Liberal Democrat leader Hazel Watson said a 15% rise would hit the elderly and those on fixed incomes hardest. She said: "It is astonishing that the Conservative administration think Surrey residents should carry the can for their own financial failings and the government's failure to properly fund services." The Conservative council had failed in its negotiations with the government, even though three cabinet ministers were Surrey MPs, she added. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling and Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt are MPs in the county along with Philip Hammond. A Department for Communities and Local Government spokesman said: "If the council sets this proposed budget, then the taxpayers of Surrey will have the final say in a referendum in May. We should trust the people. "Our long-term funding settlement means more spending power for Surrey County Council during this parliament, with £3.2 billion to deliver the services that local people want." Analysis: Jack Fiehn, BBC Surrey political reporter For years, senior councillors have spoken out about cuts to the authority's central grant and the impact on adult social care and children's services, as well as school places and road maintenance. There has been huge frustration and we seem to have reached a crunch point. Surrey residents are used to council tax rises. They have gone up every year since 2012 - but never by such a large amount. This will be a test of public support. The Liberal Democrats, Labour and the Green Party all oppose a referendum, but David Hodge has told me he has the support of his fellow Conservatives. So unless something significant happens, it is almost certain to go ahead. He has also denied reports there will be a deal with ministers to abandon the vote, putting the government on course for a row with a council in the Tory heartland. Former care minister and Liberal Democrat health spokesman Norman Lamb said Surrey's decision would be a test for local authorities, which were seeing increasing numbers of older people and younger people not getting the care and support they need. Shadow local government secretary Teresa Pearce said: "Forcing councils to rely on council tax income to fund statutory services, such as social care, is simply unsustainable and unrealistic."	A Conservative-run council wants to raise its tax by 15% in the next financial year, blaming government cuts and increased demand for social care.
Operation Anagram was formed by Strathclyde Police in 2006 after Tobin raped and murdered 23-year-old Polish student Angelika Kluk in Glasgow. It also helped convict him of the murders of 18-year-old Dinah McNicol and 15-year-old Vicky Hamilton. Police said that while the operation was being scaled back it would never end. Det Sup David Swindle, who formed the operation, said anyone with information regarding Peter Tobin would still be able to contact the Anagram incident room via e-mail which would be monitored daily. "Since Operation Anagram was formed in 2006, I could never have believed the momentum and magnitude it would have developed into," he said. "The public response and assistance from the media has been unbelievable. "The long-running investigation has brought some solace to the families of Vicky Hamilton and Dinah McNicol in knowing what happened to their loved ones." Det Sup Swindle said that although Anagram had not uncovered other murder victims of Tobin to date, he was "proud" of its "success in bringing closure" to some bereaved families. He added: "I leave Strathclyde Police after 34 years in the knowledge that we have tried our best to find out the truth of what Tobin has done and also with confidence that the Anagram processes built up over the last four and a half years ensures a life long awareness of this cowardly, vicious serial killer Tobin. "Any new information coming to light will continue to be researched which may bring similar closure to other families. "The search for the truth about what Peter Tobin has done will continue." Tobin is serving three life sentences for the murders of Vicky Hamilton, Dinah McNicol and Angelika Kluk. Ms Kluk was raped and murdered at a church in Glasgow in 2006. The bodies of Ms McNicol, from Essex, and Ms Hamilton, from Redding in Falkirk, were found the following year in the garden of Tobin's former home in Margate, Kent. Operation Anagram has helped piece together a timeline of Tobin's movements and relationships over decades in a bid to determine whether he is responsible for other unsolved crimes.	A dedicated police operation set up to examine the activities of serial killer Peter Tobin is to be wound down.
The first incident saw a 71-year-old woman from Sandyhills tricked by someone claiming to work for BT. Now a woman in Stranraer has lost money to a caller who said he was contacting her about problems with her internet. He claimed to be from BT technical support and gained remote access to her computer to take the cash. The Sandyhills incident happened on 15 September with the Stranraer con taking place seven days later. PC Siobhan Pellett said: "The ease with which these people seem to be able to gain access to their victim's computer is frightening and the sums of money being taken are substantial. "We are asking people to be very, very careful when answering a cold call from someone who tries to gain remote access to their computer in order to rectify an alleged fault. "Our message is worth repeating once again that people should never, never give out any banking details or account numbers over the telephone. "Banks, building societies and reputable businesses never ask for this information."	A 60-year-old woman in Dumfries and Galloway has been conned out of £30,000 just a week after a similar scam netted £10,000.
Media playback is not supported on this device The two heavyweights fight for the IBF title and vacant WBA belt in front of 90,000 fans at Wembley. Joshua, 27, says his 13 weeks of preparation have been "tougher times than I have had in any walk of life". Klitschko, 41, lost his heavyweight title to Tyson Fury in November 2015 - his first defeat in 11 years. In an interview at his Sheffield training camp before the biggest fight of his career, Joshua spoke about his motivation, being a "man of the people", the state of British boxing, and his family. Joshua, unbeaten in 18 fights since turning professional in 2013, said he is not worried about his safety in the ring because of the intensity of his training before the fight. "I've been pushed to places I've never been pushed before," said the Briton. "I think I take more punishment in the gym than I do in the fights. Sometimes I try things and it doesn't work and I've broken my ribs, my hand, dislocated shoulders in the gym but we get it right for the fight. "One of the main things is his mindset at the minute. He claims he is obsessed and I ask 'What is he obsessed about?' I look at myself in the mirror and it is about beating me. "I've lived simple. I've been training under the dark light so I can shine under the bright lights on April 29." Joshua had numerous incidents with the police as a youth, including being arrested for ABH, drug possession and being electronically tagged. He has previously stated that he would have been in jail were it not for boxing. But Joshua said: "I've had tougher times in the gym than I have had in any walk of life at the minute. "I put myself through it and it is important to because I don't want to be star of the gym and then when I get to the fight it's like: 'I've never faced this type of warrior before.'" Asked if this is the defining fight of his career, Joshua replied: "It is one of them. If this was towards the end of my career, I would say: 'This is the defining fight that's going to write the history books.' "But I've still got so many more years. I'm confident. I'm learning about myself, so this fight is, for me, one fight that I've got to take in my stride round by round and when I take that attitude the victory comes and we move on and there are so many other big fights in the UK." Joshua does not believe Klitschko has underestimated him, saying: "He's coming game, he's coming ready, and the body does what the mind tells it. His mind seems to be in the right place so I'm in for a tough fight." "I may not express myself flashing what I've done and telling everyone I'm the greatest," he said. "Where we grew up, everyone was about making money, but low key, understated - you probably didn't want to get your house burgled! "Who I am when I was 17 is who I am today, so not much has changed. "You've got to add a bit of flavour. It's needed now and again, but it's got to be real because I don't take boxing as an act. This is way of expressing myself and being true to myself and there are kids watching so you've got to be mindful. "If I was to be that type of person - loud and trashing tables - after a fight, I would still continue to be that way. What I notice about fighters is they act a certain way and once the fight has started they are hugging each other and are quiet. "I'm just trying to be myself on camera, in the ring, outside of the ring and off camera." Media playback is not supported on this device Asked about being very accessible, Joshua says: "It's part of boxing. It is good to lock yourself away but I'm a man of the people, it's no bother. As long as it doesn't make me late for training, I've no problem speaking to 100 people. "I'm in the same flat that I've been in since 2011 - it's been a long time. I think I'll be one of those guys who will learn the piano, the violin, bungee jump and do all the things I didn't do when I was fighting. "When I'm not fighting, I try to take a holiday and experience things, but when I'm fighting the simple life has worked and I don't try and change it." "I was on the complete opposite end of healthy living before boxing, it's got me strong," he said. "I'm a superhero to my little cousins. It's what it does for my family and my surname Joshua. "People are proud to wear that name and I'm representing my family. It is nice to have kids supporting you. It's reaching out to a wider audience. "I'm just a normal person. You have your good days, your bad days, you have road rage, everyone goes through it. "You've just got to live by the job you do and if that's what comes with it I'd rather choose winning over anything." Joshua, who turned professional after winning gold at London 2012, said: "When I first turned professional, no-one would touch me sponsorship-wise and no-one was really backing boxing. "I say look at the characters of the sport, look at the individuals, get behind the gloves." He praised fellow Brits Tyson Fury, who won the heavyweight title with a win over Klitschko in November 2015, Dillian Whyte, the WBC International heavyweight title holder, former British and Commonwealth heavyweight title holder David Price and Dereck Chisora, who challenged for the WBC heavyweight title in 2012. "As I've been in the game, Fury won, Dillian, myself, Chisora the likes of Price, up-and-coming heavyweights and lighter weights - it's definitely brought more attention." Asked if he was worried about his mum watching his fights, Joshua answers: "No, no, no, definitely not. Because she's proud, she's happy and I look after her so I think that's the main thing. "I've got a son and I definitely wouldn't want him to fight because of those reasons, his health, it's tough. "I did it quietly. When I first started fighting, I didn't tell my family. It was just about me and what I wanted to do. "My mum has always seen the positive light of fighting rather than the health issues and I've always been on the road to winning and glory. "She's had a few tough times and a few scares when I've lost as an amateur, but we bounce back, and for all the good times she's forgot about the bad times we've had."	Anthony Joshua says he will be competing at a "whole new level" when he takes on Wladimir Klitschko in Saturday's world title bout.
The 31-year-old, Fulham's top scorer in 2013-14, will join the Potters on a two-year deal on 1 July. "Steve was much in demand and we are delighted to have won the race to secure his signature," said Stoke chief executive Tony Scholes. I'm sure he will prove to be an excellent addition The former Chelsea player is the club's second signing of the summer following the capture of Phil Bardsley. They are "hopeful" of landing ex-Manchester United striker Mame Biram Diouf from Hannover 96 as Mark Hughes seeks to strengthen a squad that achieved the club's record Premier League points tally last season. Hughes signed Sidwell, who has made more than 180 appearances in the Premier League, while working as Fulham manager in 2011. The former Arsenal trainee played in all 38 of the Cottagers' top-flight fixtures in 2013-14, scoring seven goals. "Like Phil Bardsley, Steve brings great experience to our squad and I'm sure he will prove to be an excellent addition to our squad," said Scholes. Sidwell, who has also played for Reading and Aston Villa, wrote on Twitter he was "saddened" his time at Craven Cottage had ended.	Stoke City have signed midfielder Steve Sidwell on a free transfer following his release by relegated Fulham.
The name is expressed with affection by some, with hostility by others, but it calls up history for everyone. The story of his life is very much the story of our times: revolutionary movements, the Cold War, East v West, North v South, communism v capitalism - except that most of the world has passed him by. Fidel Castro has remained the same, a symbol of revolution, a communist who has survived the fall of communism. Before surgery took him out of public view in July 2006, he inspired his followers with slogans and five-hour speeches. Fidel's views continued to be made public though in the form of editorials and occasional TV appearances. Fidel maintained his rule with an iron grip, sending opponents to prison for years. Throughout his leadership, he railed against the US, its economic and trade embargo and against the evils of free markets Fidel has been praised for standing up for the oppressed of Latin America, for opposing the Yankee imperialist, for making Cuba into a more equal society than many, for developing Cuba's health service and sending doctors abroad to help others. And it wasn't only doctors he sent abroad. He despatched troops to Angola and Ethiopia in support of fellow revolutionaries. His hand was seen in many a revolutionary movement in his own continent. But he has also been condemned for intolerance, for keeping his people poor and for refusing to see the benefits of economic liberalisation that even the communists of China have embraced. Fidel Castro stopped his people from leaving the island, leading them to risk their lives in rickety boats to try to get out. At one stage in the early years of the Reagan administration he was accused of trying to take over Central America for the Soviet Union by revolution. Washington at that time saw a path that led from the guerrillas of El Salvador through Nicaragua to Cuba and right up to the door of the Kremlin. Cuban assistance to the small and then revolutionary island of Grenada in the Caribbean prompted a full-scale US invasion. Throughout his rule, President Castro remained in almost permanent confrontation with the United States - and it with him. The American embargo on Cuba has been used by both sides - as a policy by the US to isolate Cuba and as an excuse by Fidel Castro for the island's poverty. US President Barack Obama and Castro's successor as president, younger brother Raul, announced a thawing in relations in 2015 but the embargo remains in place. When Mr Obama visited earlier this year - the first by a US leader in more than half a century - Castro remained defiant, saying Cuba did not need any gifts from the "empire" in a damning letter. He cut a giant figure on the world stage during the 47 years he controlled Cuba - at one point bringing the US and the Soviet Union to the brink of nuclear war. It was the Cuban missile crisis of 1962 that propelled him into worldwide prominence. Before that he had been just a glamorous revolutionary leader. He had overthrown the dictator Batista in a classic guerrilla war and had fought off an American-led invasion by Cuban exiles on the Bay of Pigs in 1961. But when Nikita Khrushchev decided, with Fidel Castro's agreement, to station nuclear missiles in Cuba itself, the island leader turned from being a thorn in the side of the Americans into being a mortal threat. It was only the skilled diplomacy of Jack Kennedy (and of Khrushchev in the end) that saved the day, and Fidel's own island from destruction. The then-US defence Secretary Robert McNamara met President Castro in 1992. He said the Cuban leader told him there were 162 nuclear missiles in Cuba at the time of the crisis. He asked Castro if he had recommended they be used. The answer was: "Yes, I did." "And what would have happened to Cuba?" Mr McNamara asked him. "It would have been destroyed." Fidel Castro was not part of the diplomacy that ended the missile crisis. But he came out of the crisis remarkably strengthened. Kennedy promised that the US would not invade Cuba, a promise that has held. The CIA made efforts to get rid of him with bizarre plots involving the Mafia and poison. They came to nothing. President Castro's people took immense precautions to protect him from potential harm from food and drink, as diplomats who invite him to their receptions in Havana found out. He survived harm from his enemies. And whatever happens to Cuba after him, the name of Fidel will survive in history.	He is instantly recognisable both from his appearance - the beard and the military fatigues - and from his first name alone: Fidel.
The police said four men carried out the assault at Altcar Park in the Galliagh area just before 04:00 GMT on Thursday. It is believed that one of the gang had a handgun. They escaped in a small silver car. The victim did not need hospital treatment. Police have appealed for information.	A 24-year-old man has been beaten by an armed gang in a paramilitary-style attack in Londonderry.
Dramatic video footage emerged showing the TransAsia Airways plane clipping a bridge as it came down shortly after take-off from a Taipei airport. The plane, carrying 58 people, broke up as it plunged into Taipei's Keelung River. The fuselage was later salvaged by crane. There were 15 survivors pulled from the wreckage but 12 people remain missing. Television footage showed some passengers wading clear of the sunken wreckage and a toddler being pulled out alive by rescuers. Emergency teams cut open the plane while it was in the water but were unable to reach the passengers trapped in the front section of the fuselage. As night fell, a crane was used to lift the wreckage on to the bank. The death toll was expected to rise as rescue teams searched the fuselage and the river for the 12 missing passengers. "At the moment, things don't look too optimistic," Wu Jun-hong, a Taipei fire department official coordinating the rescue effort told reporters. The ATR-72 turbo-prop plane had just taken off from Taipei Songshan Airport and was heading to the Kinmen islands, just off the coast of the south-eastern Chinese city of Xiamen. It is the second TransAsia ATR-72 to crash in seven months, following an accident last July which killed 48 people and injured 15. The final communication from the pilots to air traffic control was "Mayday, mayday, engine flame out", according to a recording played on local media. The recording was not immediately verified by aviation officials. Yet again, we are looking at shocking pictures of a plane crash. You'd be forgiven for thinking that flying is getting more dangerous, but it's not. In fact, when you look at the number of crashes and fatalities compared to the huge number of people flying today, we are in a golden era of aircraft safety. According to safety analysts Ascend, 2014 was narrowly the safest year ever, with one fatal accident per 2.38 million flights, compared to every 1.91 million flights in 2013. That does not include the loss of the Malaysian airliner over Ukraine, where 298 people died, which they count as a war loss rather than an accident. Nearly a thousand people died in 2014, which is 700 more than the year before. Horrible numbers but compare that to the worst year, 1972, when 2,370 passengers were killed. There was far less flying then, maybe a quarter of what there is today. Nothing is ever without risk, but the chances of dying in an aircraft "accident" are lower than ever. Flight controllers lost contact with the plane at 10:55 local time (02:55 GMT). Footage of the plane filmed from inside passing cars showed it banking sharply, hitting a taxi and clipping the bridge before crashing into the river. "I saw a taxi, probably just metres ahead of me, being hit by one wing of the plane," an eyewitness told local media. "The plane was huge and really close to me. I'm still trembling." TV footage showed rescuers standing on the tail section of the broken wreckage trying to pull passengers out of the plane with ropes. One Taiwanese father told reporters he managed to rescue his wife before noticing his two-year-old son was still trapped underwater. The boy was later rescued but is believed to be in critical condition. The majority of the plane, including the front section of the fuselage and the wings, was submerged after it plunged into the Keelung River. Jaime Molloy, an English teacher who has lived in Taipei for three-and-a-half years and works near the scene of the crash, told the BBC: "The most disturbing scenes I saw were the debris, which included carry-on luggage and personal effects, as well as parts of the plane." TransAsia said it had contacted relatives of all the 22 Taiwanese passengers on board and was attempting to reach relatives of the Chinese nationals. Among the 15 injured, there were 11 from Taiwan, three from China and one member of the crew. The airline said that one injured passenger had already been discharged from hospital. The BBC's Cindy Sui in Taipei says the Chinese tourists could have been on their way home as many people come to Taiwan through Kinmen island. TransAsia chief Chen Xinde offered a "deep apology" in a televised news conference, but said his planes had been "under thorough scrutiny" since mid-2014. "Both our planes and our flight safety system are following strict regulations, so we also want to know what caused the new plane model to crash, but I don't want to speculate," he said. The plane's flight data recorders, also known as black boxes, have been recovered.	A plane carrying mostly Chinese tourists has crashed into a river in Taiwan, killing at least 31 people.
Symantec says the Wifatch program is closing loopholes and fixing bugs on routers it infects. Routers are being increasingly targeted by criminals keen to steal data or to help with large-scale web attacks. Symantec has monitored the network of "vaccinated" devices but, so far, has not seen it put to malicious use. Wifatch was first discovered in late 2014 and since then has been steadily scouring the web for routers and other smart devices running vulnerable software. In a blogpost, Symantec said that once Wifatch finds and infects a vulnerable router it connects to other compromised devices to download software updates that make them harder to attack successfully. In addition, it said, Wifatch tries to disinfect devices that have been compromised by malicious software. It regularly reboots devices to kill off malware running on them and return them to a clean state. As far as Symantec can tell, Wifatch's payload has no malicious components and the growing network of compromised devices has never been used for attacks, said Symantec security analyst Mario Ballano. The software also leaves a message on the router telling its owner to change the default passwords and update the firmware that controls the device. Wifatch targets a wide variety of home routers that run variations of the Linux operating system. Symantec said that "tens of thousands" of gadgets were harbouring Wifatch. About a third of all the devices it had hit were in China with Brazil and Mexico making up another quarter of its victims. Symantec remained cautious about the intentions of Wifatch despite its benign appearance. "Wifatch is a piece of code that infects a device without user consent and, in that regard, is the same as any other piece of malware," said Mr Ballano. "It should also be pointed out that Wifatch contains a number of general-purpose back doors that can be used by the author to carry out potentially malicious actions," he added.	A benevolent virus has been used to harden more than 10,000 home routers against cyber-attacks, says a security firm.
The court rejected campaigners' claims ministers were acting illegally by not suspending weapon sales to the kingdom, which is fighting a war in Yemen. The UN claims strikes on Houthi rebels caused thousands of civilian deaths. The government said defence exports would continue to be reviewed but the Campaign Against the Arms Trade said an appeal against the ruling was planned. The group had claimed the UK has contravened humanitarian law, and it attacked the refusal of the Secretary of State for International Trade to suspend export licences for the sale or transfer of arms and military equipment. Lord Justice Burnett and Mr Justice Haddon-Cave, sitting in London, said the decision to carry on the arms trade was not unlawful. The judges said "closed material", which had not been made public for national security reasons, "provides valuable additional support for the conclusion that the decisions taken by the secretary of state not to suspend or cancel arms sales to Saudi Arabia were rational". Equipment sold to Saudi Arabia includes Typhoon and Tornado fighter jets, as well as precision-guided bombs. The sales contribute to thousands of engineering jobs in the UK, and have provided billions of pounds of revenue for the British arms trade. Saudi Arabia has been supporting Yemen's internationally-recognised government after a civil war broke out in 2015. Houthi rebels, loyal to deposed president Ali Abdullah Saleh, began an attack in 2014, forcing leader Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi to flee the country for a time. Since then the Saudi kingdom, and eight other mostly Sunni Arab states, have supported an air campaign aimed at restoring Mr Hadi's government. Andrew Smith, of Campaign Against Arms Trade, said: "This is a very disappointing verdict, and we are pursuing an appeal. "If this verdict is upheld then it will be seen as a green light for government to continue arming and supporting brutal dictatorships and human rights abusers like Saudi Arabia that have shown a blatant disregard for international humanitarian law. "Every day we are hearing new and horrifying stories about the humanitarian crisis that has been inflicted on the people of Yemen." Rosa Curling, of law firm Leigh Day, which represented the campaign group, said: "Nothing in the open evidence, presented by the UK government to the court, suggests this risk does not exist in relation to arms to Saudi Arabia. "Indeed, all the evidence we have seen from Yemen suggests the opposite: the risk is very real. You need only look at the devastating reality of the situation there." James Lynch, Amnesty International's head of arms control and human rights, said the ruling was "deeply disappointing". "Irrespective of this ruling, the UK and other governments should end their shameless arms supplies to Saudi Arabia," he said. "They may amount to lucrative trade deals, but the UK risks aiding and abetting these terrible crimes." The government said UK defence exports would continue to be "under careful review" to ensure they meet the standards of the Consolidated EU and National Arms Export Licensing Criteria. "We welcome this judgment, which underscores the fact that the UK operates one of the most robust export control regimes in the world," a spokesperson said.	UK government arms sales to Saudi Arabia are lawful, the High Court has ruled, after seeing secret evidence.
At its peak more than 40 firefighters tackled the blaze in Albion Terrace, which started at about 08:10 BST. The line, which was closed for safety reasons, was reopened at about 15:15. South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue (SYFR) said crews were expected to be at the scene "damping down" throughout the evening. It is believed the unit was being used to manufacture soft toys from the film Minions. National Rail said trains are now running normally between Sheffield and Doncaster. Kevin Ronan, from SYFR, said: "We're on top of the fire now. We're just in the process of damping down the remains of the incident. "Parts of the building have collapsed already. It's been totally involved and it will probably have to be taken down." He said the cause of the fire is under investigation.	A fire at an industrial unit in Hexthorpe caused disruption to train services between Sheffield and Doncaster for several hours.
He was a surprise choice to lead the Fifa investigation, and ruffled feathers at football's governing body. On one occasion, he turned up unannounced to interview members of the senior executive committee who had cast votes in the World Cup bids. Even before he dismissed Fifa's report as "erroneous", there were signs that he was not afraid to pick a fight with his employers. In an interview last year he said his authority was to investigate "any official, top down, for misconduct... no-one is above the ethics code". He acknowledged that he took on the investigation as an outsider. "I come into this case with no history or experience of what might have happened," he said. "I will look at the facts and my jurisdiction and make decisions on whether the ethics code was violated." In a recent talk to lawyers in London about ethics in sport, Mr Garcia said Fifa's ethic's code needed transparency and leadership - a comment seen as a thinly veiled critique of Fifa boss Sepp Blatter. He eventually quit Fifa in December 2014, saying that a "lack of leadership" at the organisation had led to his decision. Mr Garcia made his name in his native New York, serving as a federal prosecutor with the Southern District of New York from 1992 to 2001 and working on a series of high-profile cases. These included the prosecution of four defendants for the bombing of the World Trade Center in 1993, and the investigation into the 1998 bombings of the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. He once told his daughter that his goal was "to punish people who do bad things and break the law". In March 2003 President George W Bush appointed Mr Garcia, a Republican, as assistant secretary for immigration and customs enforcement. The post put him in charge of more than 20,000 staff and a budget of more than $4bn. Later he moved back to New York's Southern District, serving as a US attorney from 2005-2008. There he supervised investigations into securities fraud, bringing a series of insider trading prosecutions. An investigation he led ultimately forced the resignation of Democratic governor Eliot Spitzer over a prostitution scandal. But he also took on some major international corruption and fraud cases, including the oil-for-food programme in Iraq and alleged violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act by the Norwegian energy firm Statoil. He is currently a partner at private US law firm Kirkland and Ellis, and it was from here that he was chosen by Fifa in 2012 to lead the investigation into the bidding process that awarded the World Cup to Russia in 2018 and Qatar in 2022. A year later he was among 18 Americans barred from entering Russia in Moscow's response to the Magnitsky List, which banned Russian officials from the US. Married to an FBI agent, he has kept largely out of the media spotlight and has not run for public office, despite speculation that he could be in a strong position to do so.	Michael Garcia, the American lawyer hired by Fifa to investigate the World Cup bidding process before criticising the organisation's summary of his own report and eventually resigning, is a former prosecutor with a history of launching corruption probes.
The Iridis4 has state of the art coprocessors which can each perform a trillion calculations per second - a measurement known as a "teraflop". The university said the new machine would allow academics to work on more projects at faster speeds. Iridis4 will be used for subjects such as engineering, archaeology and medicine, as well as computer science. Pro vice-chancellor Prof Philip Nelson said: "Staying ahead of the game in high performance computing [HPC] is vital to help the university stay competitive. "Simulation and computation enabled by HPC are recognised globally as the third pillar of modern research and this investment will ensure we remain world leaders in this field." Iridis4 will be used for a range of research, including engineering, archaeology and medicine, as well as computer science. The world's most powerful computer is China's Tianhe-2, which can perform 33,860 trillion calculations per second. The university said its new computer ranked among the top 10 in the UK. The most powerful is at the Science and Technology Facilities Council in Warrington. Others are based at the University of Edinburgh, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts and the United Kingdom Meteorological Office.	A £3.2m supercomputer, one of the most powerful in the UK, has been installed at the University of Southampton.
The ex-Bury player scored from close in, just as the visitors looked set to hold on for an unlikely point. Stefan Scougall hit the bar as the Blades dominated before Jacob Mellis was sent off for a foul on Matt Done. They had two second-half efforts cleared off the line and Leon Clarke had a goal disallowed before Greg Leigh was sent off for a second yellow. The win kept United in second place in League One, six points off leaders Scunthorpe, while Bury are just two points off the relegation places after their ninth consecutive league defeat.

The giant striker was in the right place at the right time to bundle home the loose ball, after Morecambe's defence failed to clear, earning what could be an important draw. They dropped to 11th, but remain just a point behind Blackpool in the final play-off spot and within two points of sixth-placed Carlisle. Gareth Ainsworth's side had fallen behind eight minutes earlier when Morecambe veteran Kevin Ellison scored a superb opener. Ellison received the ball with his back to goal on the edge of the area but turned quickly and curled a delightful effort past Jamal Blackman from the edge of the box. The first half saw no goals, but plenty of endeavour from both sides. Blackman was the busier of the two keepers making three excellent saves from three different players. His best was a flying effort to tip away Michael Rose's 30-yard drive which was heading for the top right-hand corner of the Wycombe goal The on-loan Chelsea goalkeeper then did well to tip over Paul Mullin's drive and a low volley from Ellison that was destined for the bottom left-hand corner.

Helen Zille said the "time was right" for her to step aside, adding that the DA would benefit from fresh blood. She will remain as premier of Western Cape province until 2019. Ms Zille, a former journalist and anti-apartheid campaigner, has led the party since 2007. "These kinds of decisions are a long time coming, but in the end they are made suddenly," she said. Ms Zille was born in 1951 to German immigrants. She has been a staunch defender of South Africa's liberal constitution, keeping a check on the leading ANC party's overwhelming power. In the past, she has openly criticised President Jacob Zuma and led a campaign to bring him before the courts to face allegations of bribery. Mr Zuma denied the claims, insisting he was the victim of a "political conspiracy". The DA's support is mainly concentrated in the Western Cape, which has a large white and mixed-race population, but Ms Zille had tried to make inroads into the black electorate.	The leader of South Africa's opposition, the Democratic Alliance, has said she will not stand for re-election at the party's congress next month.
Sepsis can lead to shock and rapid organ failure following an infection. A snapshot of 290 hospital patients showing signs of sepsis found only 12% were initially screened and treated in line with best practice. Health Secretary Vaughan Gething said more needed to be done and he was "open minded" about potential options. Last year, more than 7,500 people were admitted to hospitals with sepsis. It can be treated effectively with antibiotics - if spotted quickly enough. Research, due to be published later this week, was led by intensive care consultant Dr Tamas Szakmany. "We have seen in our study this year there was big variation in how the clinical teams were responding to sepsis," said Dr Szakmany. "There are important pockets of very good practice and we have seen there are hospitals, there are health boards, where the response is less good." The issue is the focus for BBC Wales' Week In Week Out programme, following Welsh weatherman Derek Brockway as he explores how his own father Cliff died of sepsis last year. On 30 December 2014, 17-year-old Chloe Christopher collapsed and died after developing sepsis. Her mother Michelle told Derek Brockway about the heartbreaking last moments of her daughter's life. The Welsh health secretary told the forecaster: "We have got a health improvement programme. "We are the first country within the UK to have this early warning score system... but it has always been about how consistently that has been adhered to. "If we level out that variation, we will end up saving more lives. So I wouldn't pretend to you or anyone else that we are perfect where we are." Mr Gething said he is considering whether to make hospitals screen patients with symptoms in the same way. "I am open minded to that, absolutely," he said. "I am not going to run away from choices to be made about improving the service." Early indications from the second annual snapshot by Dr Szakmany's team, expected to be published next year, suggest there has been an improvement.	A killer condition linked to 1,500 deaths every year in Wales is not always being treated in the same way in Welsh hospitals, new research claims.
The 22-year-old striker was one of three AC Milan players targeted during their match against Roma on Sunday, which was halted for two minutes. "If it happens one more time, I'm going to leave the pitch, because it's so stupid," the Italy international said. "I was about to leave, but they will think I wanted to leave because we had difficulty with the game." AC Milan were down to 10 men at the time when the Serie A fixture at their San Siro stadium was temporarily stopped. The game only restarted after the visiting Roma supporters were ordered to cease their behaviour. Roma, who were fined 50,000 euros (£42,400) by the Italian Football League for the incident, released a statement on Monday condemning the actions of their supporters and promised to "face this issue head-on". The punishment was criticised by Fifa president Sepp Blatter, who told the world governing body's website: "They have not made any investigation of what happened. Just to give a pecuniary sanction is not valid, not acceptable." Balotelli, who has scored 11 goals in 12 games since his January switch from Manchester City, said the incident had altered his thinking about the best way to tackle the problem. He told CNN: "I always said if it happens in the stadium, I would just behave as if nobody had done anything and that I don't care, but now I think I've changed my mind a bit." There have been a number of incidents this season involving racial abuse of AC Milan's players. A January friendly between Milan and Pro Patria was suspended because of racist chants aimed at Kevin-Prince Boateng. The following month, Inter Milan were fined 50,000 euros after their fans were found to have abused their former player Balotelli in the Milan derby. And in April, champions Juventus were fined 30,000 euros (£25,000) after their supporters racially abused the AC Milan players.	Mario Balotelli has threatened to walk off the pitch if he is ever again subjected to racist abuse from fans.
Glamorgan's total was dominated by Nick Selman's mature 101 off 144 balls, his second first-class century. But seamers Matt Taylor and Craig Miles made sure wickets fell at regular intervals in cloudy conditions in the Welsh capital. Gloucestershire struggled in turn as the bowlers remained on top all day. Selman's century, after being dropped on eight in the first over, was a welcome return to form for the Brisbane-born opener after a string of low scores following his hundred against Northants at Swansea. Aneurin Donald's quick-fire 36 off 30 balls was the next best contribution as Taylor and Miles prospered in the afternoon. Graham Wagg and Timm van der Gugten scrambled Glamorgan to a consolation bonus point. Gloucestershire's innings was a question of survival in the evening gloom, with the day ending evenly balanced. Glamorgan are being led by Michael Hogan for the first time in the absence of Jacques Rudolph, who has a neck problem. Glamorgan batsman Nick Selman told BBC Wales Sport: "It was good to get some runs for a change, the wicket was a bit slow and they bowled a bit short early on so I got through the first 25 overs and it got easier to bat from there, but it was a bit disappointing to get out just after I got a hundred. "(My season) was going well up until after (a century in) Swansea, after Swansea four ducks in a row, but it was good to spend some time in the middle at Northants. "Opening the batting in county cricket over here (in the UK), it's definitely hard, you get some good balls, you play on some green wickets and I was struggling a bit. "I was happy to get a few today and hopefully I can continue that for the rest of the season." Gloucestershire seamer Matt Taylor told BBC Radio Bristol: "There's definitely a bit on offer out there (for the bowlers), we didn't start exactly how we'd like but we got there in the end and we'd take bowling them out for 220. "I was pretty happy with that (hitting the stumps three times), the same plan as always is to hit the top of off-stump and luckily they missed them today. "I was pleased to get an opportunity in T20 and the white-ball stuff this year, now I'm getting an opportunity with the red ball it's great. "It's definitely going to be tough (for the Gloucestershire batsmen), they're a good bowling attack but hopefully we can dig in and get to a reasonable score."	Gloucestershire finished day one on 62-3 in reply to Glamorgan's 220 all out at the SSE Swalec Stadium in Cardiff.
England will play their first day-night Test when they host West Indies at Edgbaston in August. Yorkshire say they were asked by England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) about their willingness to move one of the Championship games at Headingley and would be interested in doing so. The club's chief executive Mark Arthur called it a "great opportunity". He said: "Until the fixture programme is published, we don't know when it will be or who the opposition is likely to be. But because we have got the best lights in the country for cricket purposes, then it's likely that we would be one of the selected grounds to host such an event. "Hopefully when the fixture list comes out, it's something that all members and stakeholders will save a date for in their diary. "Whether you're a club cricketer or a member who works 9-5 you'll be able to come along and watch two or three hours of Championship cricket after work and it will be very interesting to see what the uptake is on this initiative." The start of the second ever day-night Test match between Pakistan and West Indies earlier in October drew a crowd of just 68 in Dubai.	Yorkshire have said they would be interested in hosting a day-night game in the County Championship in 2017.
England seamer James Anderson, who took 3-5 on the third evening, finished with figures of 4-20 as the Red Rose skittled Hampshire for 168 on day four. The visitors had resumed on 50-5, still trailing by 148, and were unable to make Lancashire bat again. Dane Vilas' 244 had put the home team in control earlier in the match. Alex Davies and Ryan McLaren also chipped in with centuries to give Lancashire a big first-innings lead, but it was their impressive bowling display in Hampshire's second innings that ensured victory. Anderson's 15 overs cost only 20 runs as he tore through the visitors' top order, while McLaren (3-41) and Kyle Jarvis (3-49) did the rest of the damage. England's all-time leading wicket-taker Anderson was playing in his first match after a month out through injury, with his country's first Test of the summer against South Africa starting on 6 July. Gareth Berg, the last Hampshire wicket to fall, top-scored with 49, while James Vince's 29 was the next best individual effort. Lancashire have gone above Hampshire and Yorkshire up to second in Division One, 14 points behind leaders Essex, who beat Warwickshire - also by an innings. England fast bowler James Anderson told BBC Radio Lancashire: "Not many people would have expected Essex and Lancashire to be first and second after seven games but we're in a really strong position and we have a lot of competition for places. "We're not going to get carried away. We now have a big game against Warwickshire and, if we get a result there, it will put us in a great position before the back end of the summer. "We're better placed to sustain this position but we have to make sure that what happened last year doesn't happen again. This week was a really good performance but there are still areas on which we can improve. "Al Davies, Dane Vilas and Ryan McLaren got us up to a really good score. Dane and Ryan are really solid professionals who have been fantastic additions. And we thought if we could put the ball in the right areas we could really challenge them and take 10 wickets." Hampshire coach Craig White told BBC Radio Solent: "It was going to be a big ask. But to fold again on a pretty good pitch is extremely disappointing. "Bergy tried and there was a bit of fight there at the end, but it was too much to ask really. "Anderson bowled beautifully, but the ball's allowed to swing and we should be able to combat that. "It seems that if the ball does swing or seam we get in a bit of trouble. We need to work on that, improve on that, try and stay positive, and get back on the horse, so to speak."	Lancashire moved up to second in the County Championship table after thrashing Hampshire by an innings and 30 runs at Old Trafford.
Media playback is not supported on this device After an even first 30 minutes, Danny Wright tapped in from James Dayton's free-kick to put the Robins in front. But Tubbs levelled after the restart, latching onto Maxime Biamou's header and slotting in from 10 yards out. Robert Dickie headed against the bar for the Robins late on, before Deacon fired in to win the game in added time. Sutton have won just one of their past eight games in the National League - including a 6-0 home defeat by Dover on Tuesday - but Deacon's late heroics earned them a place in third round for the first time in 22 years. The U's have twice gone even further in the competition, reaching the fourth round in 1970, and again in 1989 after they famously beat First Division Coventry City in round three. They will receive £27,000 for getting through the second round, and could earn a lucrative tie with Premier League or Championship opposition when the third round draw takes place on Monday.

In the app, the cartoon characters feature with the real world in the background. The developers claim it is the first time in the UK that "augmented reality" has been used in this way. They and Conwy council hope it will bring tourists to the town where the inspiration for Alice went on holiday. The original launch of the app in August was delayed after key figures for tourists to follow were altered. Virtual characters failed to recognise sculptures in the town after Conwy council painted them. Next year marks 150 years since Alice in Wonderland was first published. Simon Burrows, co-director of Alice in Wonderland Limited which has co-ordinated the project, said: "People who use the app can look at Llandudno landmarks on screen, while characters from the Alice books tell the story behind them. "It's also possible to take a picture of yourself or your friends standing next to the Mad Hatter, the Cheshire Cat or Alice herself." The Alice in Wonderland story, and its sequel Through the Looking Glass, were written by Lewis Carroll (whose real name was Charles Dodgson). He composed the original story to entertain a young girl called Alice Liddell, with whose family he was friends. Alice Liddell's family lived in Oxford but had a house in Llandudno and spent many of their holidays there. Company director Barry Mortlock said: "I've lived in Llandudno for 36 years now, and it worried me that the town wasn't doing enough in recent years to celebrate its links with the real life Alice. "The app is now ready for next year's important anniversary. "It has the potential to attract more visitors from overseas, where there's a huge interest in the Alice in Wonderland stories." Graham Rees, Conwy council's cabinet member for tourism, said: "This will be a huge asset to Llandudno and really enhance what we can offer to visitors."	Characters from the Alice in Wonderland books will guide visitors on a tour of Llandudno in a new app which shows the town's links with the stories.
All 12,000 pupils are offered milk, fruit juice, cereal and toast in a bid to benefit their performance in school. Blackpool Council will decide on 17 June whether to extend its Â£1.3m scheme, which began in January, until the end of March 2014. Northumbria University researchers have examined the scheme's benefits. Dr Margaret Anne Defreyter, director of healthy living at Northumbria University, said: "Blackpool's free school breakfast scheme is one of the largest schemes operating within the UK. SOURCE: University of Northumbria Teachers say school meals leave pupils hungry "The overall findings of the evaluation of the Blackpool scheme are very positive and based on these findings I strongly recommend that the scheme continues." Simon Blackburn, the Labour leader of Blackpool Council, said: "It was clear from that first day that the scheme would be a success. Across Blackpool children were coming to school hungry and struggling to concentrate. "I am proud of the bold decision we made to trial this scheme, a move that no other council has made, and I've even prouder today to see the results of the research." Neil Hodgkins, head teacher of Devonshire Primary School, said: "Children who had previously had nothing, or very little, to eat first thing are now enjoying a nutritious start to the day and presenting themselves as being livelier, more alert and ready to perform better in class. "Although it is still early days to be quantifying this in terms of academic results or attainment value, we are seeing other benefits such as improved punctuality and attendance." The researchers from Northumbria University have recommended that the council should continue to evaluate the "long term educational attainment and short term cognitive performance" of pupils.	A pilot scheme offering free breakfasts to primary school children in Blackpool has improved their health and punctuality, say researchers.
The Taiwanese firm, also known as Foxconn Technology, posted a net profit of NT$37bn ($1.2bn; Â£814m) in the October to December quarter. It also reported a 16% jump in full year profit for 2012 to NT$94.8bn. Foxconn is the world's biggest contract electronics maker and Apple is one of its biggest clients. According to some estimates, orders from Apple account for almost half of Foxconn's total revenue. In the October to December quarter, Apple had sold 47.8 million iPhones, up from 37 million a year earlier. Meanwhile, the launch of iPad mini, also boosted sales of its tablet PCs - it sold 22.9 million iPads, compared with 15.4 million in the same period in 2011. However, the heavy reliance on Apple has also raised concerns that Foxconn's growth may slow in the coming months. Some analysts said the rapid rate of growth that smartphones and tablet PCs had seen in recent years could not be sustained. "In most of the developed economies, smartphones are at a mature penetration stage and tablets are pretty close to being at that stage," said Andrew Milroy of consultancy firm Frost & Sullivan. Mr Milroy added that Apple had so far not been able to replicate the success it enjoyed in the developed economies in emerging markets. He explained that in the emerging economies, Apple products were still very expensive and out of reach for many consumers. At the same time, Apple is facing increased competition from other smartphone makers in those markets. "They are being hammered by low-cost smartphones in countries such as China," he said. The fear is that if Apple's growth rate slows, it will have a knock on effect on suppliers such as Foxconn.	Hon Hai Precision Industry, a major assembler of Apple products, has posted record quarterly profits helped by growing demand for iPhones and iPads.
According to three separate analyses, a flood of automated comments to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) was detected over the weekend. More than 400,000 comments with remarkably similar wording have been detected in recent days. Net neutrality proponents argue that all internet traffic should be equal. This means that no content provider should be able to, for example, charge more for faster access to certain data. One expert described bot activity as a new form of protest. "Someone has gone out of their way to make these seem like real submissions," wrote Chris Sinchok in a blog post about the apparently automated activity. Having downloaded the comments and associated data, Mr Sinchok noticed that the names and email addresses associated with thousands of them also turned up in lists of personal data stolen from websites. He told the BBC that this suggested someone might be using information collected from breached databases to make the submissions look more authentic. "It really seems like this is getting pooled from some place in an automated fashion and it's coming in at unreasonable rates," he said. He added that the uniformity of the data was also a possible giveaway. For example, many comments are essentially identical save for the occasional, small difference - such as the exact same sentence appearing in multiple comments, but with different letters capitalised each time. And the rate at which comments were posted also seemed suspicious, starting and stopping in bursts, he added. Other watchers, including a graduate student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and another at Harvard University, have also tracked a boom in apparently automated activity directed at the site in recent days. Earlier this month, the FCC said it had been targeted by a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack that led to downtime for the comments system. This followed a television appearance by comedian John Oliver in which he urged people to post comments against the proposals on the FCC's website. "Net neutrality is such a hot-button issue and it's one of the few examples of online activism that's actually amounted to something," noted Prof Phil Howard at the Oxford Internet Institute. He cited the 2014 online protests, after which President Obama stepped in to recommend that the FCC drop earlier proposals to curtail net neutrality. "This is how people protest these days," said Prof Howard, referring to the apparently automated comments. He also pointed out that a growing number of people had the necessary programming skills to do it. However, Mr Sinchok is concerned that the bot activity will create the impression that genuine opposition to the FCC's current proposals does not really exist. "There are people that care about this issue a lot," he told the BBC. "Activity like this is really muddying the waters - and I don't want it to give [the FCC] an excuse to say, 'Hey, there's mixed support for this.'" The FCC has not yet responded to a BBC request for comment.	Bots appear to be spamming a US regulator's website over a proposed reversal of net neutrality rules, researchers have said.
Early goals from Kazenga LuaLua and Tomer Hemed gave Albion a 2-0 lead at half-time but the home side fought back after the break. Freddie Sears tapped in to pull one back and substitute David McGoldrick equalised from the spot after Bruno fouled Ryan Fraser. But Hemed nodded in two minutes later to hand the Seagulls victory. Brighton wore black armbands to pay tribute to Matt Grimstone and Jacob Schilt, two victims of the Shoreham air crash, while Albion goalkeeper David Stockdale wore a special shirt in the warm-up and personalised gloves bearing the duo's names. Ipswich and Brighton had both made unbeaten starts to the league campaign, each taking 10 points from four games, but the visitors stunned Portman Road with two quick first-half goals. First LuaLua latched on to a ball forward from Gaetan Bong and drove a low left-footed shot across Dean Gerken, and then Hemed got a faint touch on Dale Stephens' free-kick. Media playback is not supported on this device Sears twice went close for Ipswich just before the break, while Albion defender Uwe Hunemeier was lucky not to receive a second yellow card for a high foot. Town boss Mick McCarthy made a double substitution at half-time and, after Stephens drove a shot against the upright for Brighton, he was rewarded when Sears pounced to score after Brett Pitman had hit the post. The home side were level on 65 minutes when McGoldrick held his nerve from the spot but moments later Hemed got his second from LuaLua's deflected cross to restore Brighton's lead. Bobby Zamora came on as a late substitute for his first appearance since re-joining Brighton this summer, and the former England striker helped the Seagulls to close out the game. The Sussex club are now three points clear at the top of the Championship table heading into the international break. Ipswich manager Mick McCarthy: "I think Brighton are a very good side, they started well and were the better team. "In the first half they were excellent - you have to give them credit. But I thought our response in the second half was great. "Then their third goal came off a deflected cross which wrong-footed my defenders, though we also made a few little errors leading up to it. "Now we know what everyone else (in the league) feels like." Brighton boss Chris Hughton: "It was a super game and a very good spectacle for the Championship. "We were the better team at 2-0, but the only disappointment for me was that we allowed them to come back to 2-2, which I didn't think was a fair reflection of the game. "But we showed great character to go on and win the game and overall I thought we had the right balance between defending well and breaking quickly."	Brighton beat Ipswich Town in a five-goal thriller to leapfrog the Tractor Boys and go top of the Championship.
Media playback is not supported on this device Bottom side United's first win in Perth in four years, and Kilmarnock's draw away to Partick Thistle, means the gap between them is down to five points. "It was a wonderful effort. With 10 men, that spirit and character was there again," said the Finn. "I can't praise the boys enough. They've got real mental toughness." Media playback is not supported on this device Ryan Dow had put United into a deserved lead midway through the first half. However, Saints came back into the match and when Coll Donaldson was sent off for denying Chris Kane an obvious goal-scoring opportunity, the visiting fans may have feared another damaging day in their bid to avoid automatic relegation. St Johnstone midfielder Murray Davidson hit the crossbar as the home side pressed for an equaliser but United held firm. "We still have a long way to go but that was a small step towards it," continued Paatelainen. "The mood is positive. Killie will pick up points so we need to be strong. They have a quality manager, they have fantastic players in every department, but days like this will help our chances of survival and that's what we hang on to. "I'm really pleased with everybody's effort." Saints manager Tommy Wright was frustrated at his team's lack of bite in the first quarter of the match. "Up until they scored we didn't compete well enough, didn't make enough tackles, didn't win enough first headers or second headers," he lamented. "I thought we got a slap in the face with the goal and we were much better after that. Probably they've defended well enough overall to win the game. "When you give a team something to hold on to, even with 10 men, it makes it really difficult." Alan Mannus had made two impressive saves prior to the United goal but he will have been disappointed to have allowed Dow's shot past him. "I think in the build-up to the goal we should have done better," said Wright. "We dropped too deep and we should have dealt with the cross better. He got a free contact inside the box. "Because Alan was on the move, it hit the underside of his body and squirmed over the line."	Mixu Paatelainen praised his Dundee United players' resolve as they beat St Johnstone 1-0, despite being reduced to 10 men for the last 30 minutes.
The Procession to Calvary, completed in 1602, will remain on show at Nostell Priory in West Yorkshire. The painting had been put up for sale for £2.7m. A campaign by The Art Fund and National Trust raised £1.7m. The National Heritage Memorial Fund, which aims to save key historic items, has now stepped in with the final £1m. The painting depicts Christ carrying the cross on his way to crucifixion and has hung at Nostell Priory, a stately home near Wakefield, for 200 years. The priory is the family home of Lord St Oswald, who put it up for sale to pay for the restoration of the estate. He had said he would put it up for auction if the target was not reached by Christmas. Members of the public donated £680,000 to the campaign, with almost £510,000 coming from trusts and foundations, while The Art Fund gave a further £500,000. Art Fund director Dr Stephen Deuchar said: "Considering the economic climate, this has been a hugely challenging campaign and we are enormously grateful to all our members and supporters who have given so generously. "Working with the National Trust has been a very fruitful experience, pooling our resources to pull out all the stops and save this remarkable painting for Nostell Priory and its visitors." Dame Jenny Abramsky, chair of the National Heritage Memorial Fund, said:  "The overwhelming public support to help secure this stunning painting has been an inspiration. "Individual giving combined with ongoing support from government funds such as the National Heritage Memorial Fund will play an increasingly important role in securing our most precious heritage." The fund's money comes from the Treasury and is intended to be the last resort for saving items of importance to the UK's national heritage. It has received £10m a year since 2007, but its grant will be halved from this year as a result of government cuts.	An Old Master by painter Pieter Brueghel the Younger will remain on public display after a government fund paid £1m to save it for the nation.
The 19-year-old is in her second year of competition at the Federation Internationale du Ski (FIS) snowboard cross World Cup circuit. Qualification for PyeongChang 2018 depends on points accumulated from races during the season of the Games. The 2018 games' opening ceremony takes place on 9 February 2018 in South Korea. Potter, who is from Bangor, said: "It [the Winter Olympics] is definitely on my mind, I'm still part of Olympic qualification. "I am just taking every race one step at a time and I'm not getting too ahead of myself and I am aiming for that. I just want to see how things turn out "I have still got time, I have still got a year to go." She competes in Germany this weekend looking to improve on her season best finish of 26th place claimed in the USA on 21 January.	Welsh snowboarder Maisie Potter says the 2018 Winter Olympics are on her mind a year away from the games' start.
George Hamilton was speaking to MPs on the Northern Ireland affairs committee. It is investigating how a UK exit from the EU could affect Northern Ireland. Mr Hamilton said the PSNI would "not take a position on exit or not" and would work with whatever circumstances are in place after the EU referendum. Voters will go to the polls in June to decide whether the UK should remain a member of the EU. Asked on whether an exit from the EU would affect policing, Mr Hamilton said: "I think all of this is probably doable with an exit, but it will be slower, complicated and more costly is the view we would take from a practical policing perspective." But he said the PSNI had a "very good working relationship" with a number of police forces in non-EU countries, "most notably America". Mr Hamilton, who appeared before the committee with Assistant Chief Constable Will Kerr, also said he did not think the PSNI's link with the Irish police would suffer in the case of an exit from the EU. He said "the relationships are secure". He added that if a so-called Brexit - a shorthand term for a UK exit from the EU - took place he was "absolutely sure the quality of the relationship and the professionalism of both organisations would not be diminished". The committee is examining areas like the economy and the border with the Republic of Ireland. It has already heard evidence from a wide range of politicians and business leaders.	A UK withdrawal from the European Union could make policing in Northern Ireland slower, more complicated and more costly, the head of the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) has said.
Richard Davies, 41, died of a single gunshot wound to the chest after firing at officers in St Neots, Cambridgeshire, in October 2015. His widow Samantha said she had a text from her child saying they were tied up and begging her to "call the police". Mr Davies was shot after firing a gun from the house. The inquest continues. The father of three said he "wanted to end his life" after learning his marriage was over, the hearing in Peterborough was told earlier this week. More news from Cambridgeshire Giving evidence at the hearing, Mrs Davies said she had initially believed her husband had "some acceptance" about the end of their relationship and said "there wasn't an ounce of anger" during their conversation earlier that day. However, he had made several trips to a nearby shop to buy alcohol and had been carrying a knife, the inquest heard. Mrs Davies went to visit her sister and when her children returned to the family home their father tied them up. The inquest then heard how the children managed to make 999 calls and alert their mother. She received a text that read: "Call the police. Get them to come to our house. Dad's going to kill himself. He's tied us up. I'm not joking." When Mrs Davies arrived, one child had managed to escape. She said when Mr Davies came to the door "he didn't really look like my husband". He returned a short time later with a knife pointed at his chest, she told the hearing. Her other children managed to escape and Mrs Davies was taken to a neighbour's house. Mr Davies was shot dead by a police marksman after firing six shots from the house, the inquest heard. Mrs Davies said she had never seen his home-made gun or ammunition before, and her family was "forever changed" by what happened. The inquest continues.	The widow of a man shot dead by police has told an inquest of a desperate text sent by one of their children saying "dad's going to kill himself".
He said he was disappointed that judges ruled ministers could not invoke Article 50 - starting formal Brexit negotiations - without MPs' approval. Mr Cairns was at a breakfast meeting with business leaders in Cardiff. Welsh Conservative MP David Davies warned attempts to block Brexit could lead to an early general election. Mr Cairns told BBC Wales that there was an "obligation" on politicians in all UK parliaments to give firms certainty about the UK's departure from the European Union. "What investors and employers want is the direction of travel and that's what we're focused on," he said. The UK government has said it intends to appeal against Thursday's High Court ruling. First Minister Carwyn Jones has said that would be a mistake, but on Friday the Welsh Government announced it would apply to have a voice in the appeal. Mr Cairns claimed the UK was in a "strong position" on the Brexit negotiations as it had one of the world's fastest growing economies. He said he wanted to work with the Welsh Government to get "a good deal" for Wales, and also wanted to work with Europe. "It's in our interests that Europe grows and it's in Europe's interest that the UK and Welsh economies grow," he said. Mr Davies, MP for Monmouth and chair of the Welsh Affairs Select Committee, warned that politicians seeking to keep the UK in the EU would now use the judges' decision to try to block Brexit. "There'll be members of parliament looking to find excuses and flaws in the legislation that the government bring forward and the negotiation package, if you like, to try and vote against it," he told BBC Radio Wales. "This is all about trying to undo the result of the referendum - let's be in no doubt about that." He added: "This could easily lead to an early general election if that's what it takes to get this sorted out." But Labour's Shadow Welsh Secretary Jo Stevens said Parliament now needed to do its job and scrutinise the UK government's approach to Brexit. "How we leave the European Union was not on the ballot paper and there are a number of ways in which that could happen," she told BBC Radio Wales. "There's no consensus on that yet because the government haven't yet disclosed any details of how they intend to approach both the negotiations and the end point when we leave the EU. "So of course Parliament should scrutinise those plans - that's exactly what Parliament is there to do. "The court decision yesterday simply says, as we all knew, that Parliament has a clear role - a legal role, a constitutional role and an incredibly responsible role to try and influence how that exit happens." However, Pontypridd Labour MP Owen Smith told the BBC's Daily Politics programme he could "potentially" vote against the triggering of Article 50 in a Commons vote. "Most [Labour] colleagues feel that we couldn't possibly do anything other than trigger Article 50 - I disagree with them," he said. "If we have no further clarity as to whether Britain is going to be better or worse off as a result of the ending of the negotiations then I think the right thing for me to do on behalf of my constituents is not to vote to make them worse off."	Businesses need stability after the UK government's High Court defeat over the trigger for leaving the EU, Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns has said.
The west African nation branded the 54-member grouping, which includes the UK and most of its former colonies, a "neo-colonial institution". The withdrawal was announced on state TV but no other reasons were given. Two years ago President Yahya Jammeh accused the UK of backing his political opposition ahead of elections. Commonwealth officials said they only heard about the move through the media and had not yet been contacted by The Gambia. A spokesman said Secretary-General Kamalesh Sharma had seen the reports with "dismay and disappointment" and had asked for "clarification" from the country. There is a history of tension between President Jammeh, who came to power in a 1994 coup, and the UK. Earlier this year, a Foreign Office report singled out The Gambia for its human rights record, citing cases of unlawful detentions, illegal closures of newspapers and discrimination against minority groups. On Thursday a Foreign Office spokesman said: "Decisions on Commonwealth membership are a matter for each member government. We would very much regret Gambia, or any other country, deciding to leave the Commonwealth." In August last year The Gambia was criticised by Amnesty International and others for executing nine prisoners by firing squad. The Commonwealth was founded in 1931 but acquired its modern shape after 1949 as former British colonies and protectorates, including The Gambia, started to achieve self-government and varying degrees of independence. According to the Commonwealth's charter, member states should communicate and co-operate "in the common interests of our peoples and in the promotion of international understanding and world peace". In its statement, The Gambian government said it had "withdrawn its membership of the British Commonwealth". It said it had "decided that The Gambia will never be a member of any neo-colonial institution and will never be a party to any institution that represents an extension of colonialism". But Bakary Dabo, former vice president of The Gambia and chairman of the country's campaign for democratic change, said people there are generally "very happy" to be part of the Commonwealth. He said the government had recently begun "picking up war against poorly specified enemies called 'western powers'". Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Dabo said this rhetoric had "accelerated" in recent years and been used when President Jammeh gave a "rambling" speech at the United Nations General Assembly last month Also at the UN, President Jammeh said homosexuality was one of the three "biggest threats to human existence". He has also drawn international criticism for claiming he can cure Aids with a herbal body rub and bananas. BBC Africa analyst Farouk Chothia said despite its image as an idyllic holiday destination, The Gambia, and its population of less than two million, were kept under tight control by its eccentric leader. The latest decision was bound to come from him, our analyst added. The Royal Commonwealth Society, an education charity which works in Commonwealth countries, said The Gambia's announcement was unexpected and appeared to be undemocratic. Society director Michael Lake said President Jammeh had made the decision "without consulting The Gambia's people" and the country's withdrawal would be "a loss felt by both its people and the wider Commonwealth network". He added: "Far from being a 'neo-colonial institution', the modern Commonwealth operates on a consensus model and its voluntary membership is predicated primarily on a country's commitment to upholding shared values and principles." The last time a nation left the Commonwealth was in 2003, when Zimbabwe withdrew. The Queen, who is 87, is the head of the Commonwealth, which holds its next heads of government meeting in Colombo, Sri Lanka, next month. However, the gathering will be the first that the Queen has not attended since 1971. She will send her son, the Prince of Wales instead. Buckingham Palace said she would make fewer overseas trips because of her age. Three African countries have joined the Commonwealth in recent years. Rwanda was admitted in 2009 after applying for membership the previous year, while Cameroon and Mozambique became members in 1995.	The Gambia's decision to withdraw from the Commonwealth 48 years after joining is something to "very much regret", the UK Foreign Office has said.
She said the Games would bring "honour and pride" to the country. Ms Rousseff, who has seen her popularity plunge amid a serious economic crisis, says the country will rise to the challenge and will organise a safe and successful Games. She said 12,000 people would be chosen to carry the Olympic torch through some 300 Brazilian cities next year. "We are now 399 days from the opening of the Olympic Games and on August 5 the whole world will look at us, will see the Olympic flame light up," Ms Rousseff said at a ceremony in Brasilia. The torch relay will begin in the Brazilian capital in May and will end at Rio's Maracana stadium in August, at the Olympic's opening ceremony. The Olympics organising committee and sponsors will choose the torchbearers in the next few months. Each person will carry the torch for 300 metres. The relay will take the torch through the Federal District, where Brasilia is, and 26 states during 90 to 100 days. Ms Rousseff has promised security will be a priority, inviting the thousands of fans who travelled to Brazil for the football World Cup to return for the Rio Games. Members of the International Olympic Committee have expressed concern over delays in the works for the Games. Another major concern has been pollution in the waters of the Guanabara Bay, where the sailing and windsurfing events will be held. The authorities say they understand athletes' concerns but insist that water pollution will not pose a major health risk during the Olympics, which will be held in August 2016. "We are confident that we can meet the challenge before us," said Ms Rousseff. "We will put on a historic Olympics." Rio de Janeiro will be the first South American city to host the Olympics.	Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff has unveiled the torch to be used at the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.
Four of its high-speed 175 Coradia train units have been taken off routes along the north Wales coast and to Manchester. Work on its 150 class of diesel trains is also under way. Arriva Trains said as a result "some affected peak time services have been busier than usual". The Coradia trains are the fastest in the fleet operating at up to 100mph on the lines from Chester across to Holyhead, and are between 16 and 17-years-old. They pull two and three carriage trains. "We can confirm that four of our 175 units are currently out of use for corrosion repairs, also our 150 fleet is undergoing corrosion repairs," said a spokesperson for the operator. "We will not be sourcing any extra capacity due to the timescales involved and lack of availability and there are no plans to use the loco stock on the weekends. "We regret any inconvenience that this has caused to our customers whilst we carry out this essential maintenance work." The rail company said it hoped all the maintenance work on its trains would be completed by the summer.	Rail operator Arriva Trains Wales has been forced to pull some of its fleet out of service to deal with corrosion problems.
Mr Tsilikin, 54, was found on Thursday evening after friends and family had been unable to contact him. His mobile phone and computer are missing. Police have opened a murder inquiry. Mr Tsilikin was a well-known culture and arts critic, working on TV and radio as well as for print media such as Kommersant, Vogue and Elle. Mr Tsilikin had reportedly just returned from a trip to the Latvian capital, Riga. Friends and family last spoke to him at the end of last week. Mr Tsilikin was found with multiple knife wounds and it is believed he may have been dead for at least two days. The Russian Investigative Committee said a forensic investigation was being carried out and it had not ruled out "murder committed on domestic grounds". St Petersburg Union of Journalists chairwoman Lyudmila Fomichev told Kommersant: "This is a great tragedy for the entire journalistic community, because he was a very well-known, great journalist who wrote on culture and art." Mr Tsilikin, a graduate of the Leningrad State Institute of Music and Cinema, turned to journalism after the collapse of the Soviet Union, working for the newspaper Rush Hour and editing Culture and Society. He also worked on a number of TV and radio programmes, as well as other newspapers and magazines.	Noted Russian journalist Dmitry Tsilikin has been found stabbed to death in his flat in St Petersburg.
Davies, 47, led Forest to successive play-off campaigns while at the City Ground but had an uneasy relationship with the board and was sacked in June. When asked if he would go back to work for a new regime, Davies told BBC Late Kick Off: "I'd be delighted to go back. I have great feelings for the club. "I did want to get them to the Premier League. I'd love to finish that job." Forest have scored just 22 goals in 27 Championship games this season Forest, who have lost nine of their last 11 games, are third from bottom in the Championship and sit four points adrift of safety. Manager Steve Cotterill took over from Steve McClaren in October but, despite an initial upturn in form, the Reds have been in woeful form of late and have scored just four-goals in their last 11 matches. But Davies remains convinced they can turn things around: "I am sad to see what has happened," the former Preston and Derby boss added. "But I wish them well and have no doubt they will get out of their troubles. "The club deserve to be in the Premier League."	Ex-Nottingham Forest boss Billy Davies says he has "unfinished business" at the club and would love to return.
Scores more are still missing in Teluk Wondama district after flash floods and landslides that were triggered when a river burst its banks. Hundreds of people have been injured and more than 5,000 are being housed in tents set up in emergency camps. The National Search and Rescue Agency and military have sent reinforcements to help deal with the disaster. The sudden flooding on Monday caught residents by surprise, officials said, contributing to the high death toll. The local airport has now reopened and roads have been largely cleared of debris, which is helping to speed up aid deliveries to the area, reports say. Navy warships had previously been used to carry tents, medical supplies and food to the disaster zone. Thousands of buildings, roads and bridges in five villages have been damaged or destroyed. The head of the the provincial relief agency, Dortheis Sawaki, said 104 bodies had been recovered, but many more people were missing and the death toll was expected to rise. "It's a tragedy. The smell of rotting corpses is everywhere. Power is down. There's no clean water," she was quoted by AP as saying. Many parts of the country had been badly hit by heavy rains, winds and high waves this year, meteorologists said.	More than 100 people are now known to have died in flooding in the eastern Indonesian province of West Papua.
It is the first professional contract for the former Bristol Rovers trainee. "When my agent told me that Forest Green were interested I was totally thrilled," Davies told the club website. "I can't wait to get started." Forest Green - who finished second in the National League in 2015-16 - gave a first senior deal to 18-year-old striker Olly Mehew last Thursday.	Forest Green Rovers have signed Wales Under-19 international striker Blake Davies on a one-year deal.
Inciting people to harass others online, known as virtual mobbing, could also result in court action, under new Crown Prosecution Service guidance. The director of public prosecutions said it means the CPS would prosecute just as if offences occurred offline. But she stressed this did not mean prosecutors could "stifle free speech". The new guidance aims to help police identify online crimes more easily. It also highlights those who post people's personal information, such as bank details - known as doxxing. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders said: "The internet's not an anonymous place where people can post without any consequences. People should think about their own conduct. "If you are grossly abusive to people, if you are bullying or harassing people online, then we will prosecute in the same way as if you did it offline." However, Ms Saunders said context will be an important factor in decisions - for example "if you're offensive, the legislation would say you have to be grossly offensive, and that's quite a high test". One woman, who wished to remain anonymous, said she and her daughter, who has Down's Syndrome, had suffered such severe online abuse over the last six years that they had to move house three times. The abuse started, she said, when a friend wrote a book about trolls - anonymously but mentioning her by name. "The trolls photoshopped images of myself and my daughter on to pornography and posted it on Facebook. They have said I'm a paedophile and called her hateful names like mongoloid; they even set up a website in her name." The woman believes the trolls kept getting hold of her details using official forms she submitted when complaining at the use of images of her daughter. "Even after we moved, they have called us at three of four in the morning threatening to petrol-bomb our house if we will not give up the name of the author. "It's been horrific - this trolling is not free speech; it's hate speech," she said. She added that one of the men stood outside the family home and followed her daughter to school, taking pictures. The incidents are now being investigated by police. Kevin Healey told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme he had been abused online for five years over his autism campaign work. He said: "Not even one troll has been prosecuted or jailed, even though I have made complaints to Twitter and the police. "It's been a nightmare; it's been horrific - it doesn't go away. It's with you 24 hours and seven days a week, there's no escape from it". Mr Healey said he doesn't think the changes will make any difference and wants changes to legislation in the UK - and abroad. "With the laws in the UK, if someone is trolling you from outside the UK - and my last batch of trolls were from the US - the police said we can't do anything," he added. The CPS says it will use "considerable caution" before charging those posting "grossly offensive" material. The changes come after a report found that one in four teenagers is abused online over their sexual orientation, race, religion, gender or disability. The CPS also said underage "sexting" between consenting children in a relationship should not be prosecuted, but cases which involve "exploitation, grooming or bullying" may lead to legal action. Ms Saunders told the BBC: "If they are children, they are the same age, there's no suggestion or any coercion or bad motives, then we would not expect that case to be prosecuted. It shows you how careful you have to be about the context of it," she said. Asked about whether guidelines on misogynistic hate crimes would be introduced, Ms Saunders said: "We probably need to think about it." A new law on revenge porn - someone uploading explicit images or film of a former partner to humiliate or embarrass them - has led to the prosecution of 206 people across England and Wales since its introduction in April 2015. The public policy statements on hate crime will be subject to public consultation for 13 weeks.	Internet trolls who create derogatory hashtags or doctored images to humiliate others could face prosecution in England and Wales.
Launched last year, the widely unpopular programme saw presenters mingle with a live audience and included funny home-video clips. The BBC said it will now revert to its original Today at Wimbledon format. A spokesman said this year's show will "have a traditional look and feel" and will "bring highlights of the day's action and insight from our expert pundits". Last year, the corporation made major changes to its TV highlights coverage, replacing host John Inverdale with Clare Balding and introducing a chat show-style format. At the time, The Guardian said "the whole show is a mess", while a scathing review in the Daily Mail referred to it as "super right-on" and "tooth-achingly trendy". Mounting public criticism forced the corporation to tweak its format halfway through the tournament, eventually removing the studio audience altogether. "Last year we made some format changes to the programme which evolved throughout the championships based on feedback from our audience," the BBC spokesman said. This year will see the return of Today at Wimbledon, with Balding remaining as the host alongside two expert pundits. It will be shot from a new studio next to Henman Hill overlooking the All England Club grounds.	The BBC has confirmed it is scrapping Wimbledon highlights show 2Day.
The victim was killed on Wednesday about a mile from a West Glacier campground. The authorities say armed police officers are searching for the bear but gave no further details. Bear attacks are rare in the area with only 10 deaths reported since the park was created in 1910. The dead cyclist was a 38-year-old officer with the US Forest Service, Flathead County Sheriff Chuck Curry told Daily Inter Lake.com. Officials say the grizzly confronted two cyclists on a trail after they disturbed it. The dead rider was taken off his saddle by the bear and the other rode off to get help. The US Fish and Wildlife Service recently announced plans to remove grizzly bears from the threatened species list. Who, What, Why: What should you do if you encounter a bear?	A grizzly bear has attacked and killed a cyclist just outside the Glacier National Park in the northern US state of Montana, police say.
The 17-year-old boy was arrested at an address in Netherton, West Midlands Police said, and remains in custody. A 65-year-old man was attacked at 18:15 GMT in Owen Street, Kates Hill, Dudley, suffering serious stab wounds to his head, shoulder, chest and back. Police said he was now in a stable condition in hospital. Det Insp Greg Evans said: "Thankfully, the man is... recovering well in hospital. "We are still working to establish a motive for the attack and we are currently questioning a teenage boy, who was arrested yesterday afternoon."	A teenager has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a man was stabbed on his doorstep in the West Midlands on Tuesday.
The Electoral Commission said 38 MPs had highlighted people, including students, claiming to have voted twice, which is a criminal offence. It said individual electoral registers run by councils should be better joined up to help identify duplicate entries. Labour warned against making it harder for young people to register to vote. A record number of 46.8 million people were registered to vote in the 8 June election, 500,000 higher than in 2015 and also more than the 46.4 million figure for the EU referendum. Of these, 68.7% actually voted on the day, the highest turnout figure for a general election since 1997. There was a surge in applications to register to the vote in the days after Theresa May called the snap poll on 18 April and also in the days leading up to the 22 May deadline. In total, 2.9 million applications were received over the six-week period. Several constituencies found that the size of their electorate rose by more than 10%, including seats with large student populations such as Canterbury, Cambridge, Bristol West and Leeds Central. However, concerns over the number of duplicate applications - a problem which initially surfaced after last year's EU referendum - continue to persist. At the moment, there is no direct link between electoral registers, which are held and managed by electoral registration officials around Britain, and the online registration service now used by a majority of people. The two systems use different databases and cannot communicate directly with each other. Between 1 December 2016 and the 22 May deadline, about 4.9 million applications to vote were submitted, the majority of them done online. But the net increase in the number of entries on the electoral register during that period was only 1.4 million, suggesting "a significant proportion of applications are likely to have been duplicates". With no way of people checking online whether they are already registered, the proportion of duplicate applications is estimated to have ranged between 30% and 70% in different areas. The watchdog said this had caused significant administration and financial burdens for electoral officials and should be addressed by clearer information on registration sites, including potentially a verification function which it said was used in Australia, New Zealand and the Republic of Ireland. Despite efforts to flag up to people that they did not need to register if they had been sent a poll card or had voted in May's local council elections, the watchdog said it appeared to have made little difference and urgent action was now needed. "The relative ease of submitting an application to register to vote using the online service, in comparison to the difficult of contacting a local authority electoral services team by telephone or email to check if they were already registered, meant many people simply submitted another application," the report said. Although there was a lack of evidence to back up claims on social media that some people had voted twice, the watchdog said it took the issue very seriously and anyone with information should contact the police. It stressed that although some people - including students and those with second homes - may lawfully be able to register in more than one constituency and cast more than one vote in local elections, voting twice in a general election was an offence punishable by an unlimited fine. The "dispersed and unconnected" nature of the 381 electoral registers in Britain means it is not possible to collectively cross-check entries, the watchdog said, and being able to do so would significantly reduce the risk of double voting. It is also calling for people who are registered in two seats to choose in advance which one they will vote in at future general elections. Labour's shadow minister for voter engagement, Cat Smith, said voting twice was a serious offence and police needed to have the resources to prosecute people suspected of doing so. But she warned against a knee-jerk reaction, given the rise in registration and turnout, particularly among younger voters. "A blanket ban on being registered at two addresses would exclude those who for reasons of work or study need to be registered in two places," she said. "This cannot be an attempt to make it harder for young people and students to register to vote."	Reports of people voting more than once in June's election are "troubling" but there is little evidence of widespread abuse, the elections watchdog has said.
Well perhaps it is. It certainly took the commodities markets (and me) rather by surprise when it agreed to cut production at a meeting in Algiers. In fact the group has a lot of work to do before it has a real and sustained impact on the price. But that decision was not what the market expected. Traders thought the result would be more disarray, as there was at a meeting of Opec and some other oil exporters in Doha back in April. This time they did manage to make progress. The context for the Algiers decision - and the unsuccessful attempts to agree action before - is crude oil prices are less than half what they were in June 2014. That hurts Opec member countries. Government finances and economic performance have taken a substantial hit. In Saudi Arabia for example, the government's finances were in surplus to the tune of 12% of annual income (GDP) in 2012. Last year there was a deficit of 16%. Angola's economy grew 7% in 2013. Last year it was 3%. Venezuela's figures are much worse, though it's far from being entirely due to the lower price of oil. That has however severely aggravated the economic damage done by the country's political crisis. Opec member countries have felt this financial pain with increasing intensity for almost two years now. Opec doesn't account for the whole market by a long way. There are very large oil producers that are not members, notably the United States, Russia, China and Canada.  But the group, which currently has about 40% of the global market can move it by cutting production - and it does have a history of responding to low oil prices, by cutting production. In the past Saudi Arabia, the group's biggest player, has often led the effort. This time the situation was complicated by Iran's emergence earlier this year from international sanctions over its nuclear programme. Tehran was determined to take advantage and sought to recover its share of the market. For Opec, the trouble was that Saudi Arabia was unwilling to curb production without Iran doing likewise, a position also underpinned by the longstanding geopolitical tension between the two countries which are the leading powers in the Gulf. That tension was the reason for the failure in Doha in April. Things seem to have changed. Iran has boosted oil production already. It could go higher, but not as easily as was the case in the immediate aftermath of the lifting of sanctions.  Saudi Arabia has softened its position. The oil minister Khalid al-Falih, who was appointed after the Doha meeting, is reported to have said in Algiers that Iran, as well Nigeria and Libya would be allowed to produce "at maximum levels that make sense". The secretary general of the group, Mohammad Sanusi Barkindo, told the BBC that those three countries "have lost a considerable volume of their production due to unfortunate circumstances". He said "they will be treated differently." It also appeared to be the case for some time after the price fall began in 2014 that Saudi Arabia was willing to tolerate the situation because of the pressure it put on competitors, especially shale oil producers in the United States. The rise of this sector over the last decade or so is seen as a key factor behind the plentiful supply of oil that partly drove the price fall. Some shale operators have cut back, but overall oil production in the US in 2015 was higher despite the lower prices.  If the Saudi aim was to squeeze the American industry, they have not had anything like the success they hoped for. It does look as though the Saudis have decided they need a new strategy. So Opec agrees they want to take action to push prices up. The detail will be difficult to negotiate. How will they allocate the production cuts between members? How differently will Iran, Nigeria and Libya be treated? And what baseline level of production will they use in calculating new production ceilings? It's also likely they will want some non-members to co-operate. The US and Canada won't. They don't believe in the kind of market management that Opec is trying to achieve and in any case oil production is done in those countries by private businesses which will not take orders from energy ministers. Russia, however, might be willing to come on board and did discuss the possibility at the Doha meeting. And then with Opec there is always the question of whether member countries will comply with any agreed limits on their own production. The reaction of the oil market to the Algiers agreement is telling. The price of crude oil rose and then fell back. It remains very much within the range that it has been trading in for the last six months.  In short it looks like the market view is that something has changed at Opec, but traders will need to see Opec filling in all the details of an agreement before they are convinced that prices really are heading upwards.	Opec, the oil producers' group is back in the driving seat.

The NHS spent £8.84m on private ambulances in the capital last year compared to £795,000 in 2011, according to Freedom of Information data. The London Ambulance Service (LAS) conceded it was losing staff due to "pressure on the organisation". But LAS denied claims it had employed private staff previously sacked by the NHS. Heidi Alexander, Labour MP for Lewisham East, claimed London ambulances were taking "on average two minutes longer than three years ago" to respond to the most serious call-outs. Labour said its research discovered private ambulance usage by ambulance trusts across the country grew by 82% between financial years 2011/12 and 2013/14, from £37m to £67.5m last year. Private ambulance spending In Yorkshire and the North East more than quadrupled to hit £3.56m and £2.9m respectively, said Labour, although other ambulance services maintained low spending during the two years, while one trust reduced its reliance on private vehicles. Shadow health minister Jamie Reed raised concerns over the figures and the "increasing use" of private ambulances during health questions in the House of Commons. But his comments were branded "absolute nonsense" by public health minister Jane Ellison, who said that previous Labour government "occasionally deployed private ambulances too". Brendan Kemp, regional organiser for the GMB union, questioned the hiring practices of ambulance trusts and their ability to keep staff. "Who's checking the qualifications of the staff that man these vehicles?" he said on BBC London 94.9. "Often staff that have been dismissed by London Ambulance Service for something, often they'll reappear working for a private contractor." But Jason Killens, director of operations for the LAS, said every private contractor "is checked by us before we use them". "Staff that leave the LAS for reasons of clinical safety would not be redeployed on those private contracts with us," he told BBC London 94.9. Mr Killens said increasing demand each year "is adding pressure in the organisation" and conceded that "some staff leave" as a result, with about 500 vacancies currently unfilled. He added: "There is a small number that leave us and go and work in the private sector, but the vast majority of people that leave the ambulance service in London go to work elsewhere in the NHS."	Spending on private ambulances in London grew by 1,000% between 2011 and 2013, the Labour party has claimed.
It was back in 2008, and James Watt and Martin Dickie's then tiny brewery at Fraserburgh, north-east Scotland, was little over a year old and struggling. Selling their US-style craft beers from the back of their van at farmers' markets, they were missing payments on their £20,000 ($30,000) bank loan. "We were selling a couple of cases on a good day, and losing money," says Mr Watt, now 32. And then they decided to enter a bottled beer competition organised by supermarket group Tesco. BrewDog won first, second, third, and fourth place. "So we went down to Tesco's headquarters [just north of London], and they told us they loved our beer and wanted to put us in 500 shops, buying 2,000 cases a week," says Mr Watt. "We put on our best poker faces and said 'no problem'. Yet we were just two guys filling bottles by hand." With Tesco wanting first deliveries in four months' time, Mr Watt and Mr Dickie, also now 32, went to their bank to ask for another £150,000, so they could quickly install a bottling line, and expand production. But failing to meet the payments on their existing loan, the bank said a firm "no". So the business partners went to another lender, and lied. Mr Watt says: "We said that our bank had offered us an amazing deal, but that if you can match it we'll switch, and they went for it. You have got to do what you have to do." With BrewDog now being able to increase its brewing facilities, it was able to start supplying Tesco on time with bottles of its Punk IPA. The beer was an immediate hit, and the other UK supermarkets soon followed suit. Fast forward to 2014, and BrewDog is due to see its turnover top £32m this year. It employs 357 people, and as well as continuing to supply the likes of Tesco UK-wide, it owns 25 bars, 18 across the UK, and seven abroad. And now based at a larger brewery down the road in the town of Ellon, it exports to 52 countries. Childhood friends who grew up in the Scottish town of Peterhead, Mr Watt and Mr Dickie started brewing beer together as a hobby in their early 20s. At the time Mr Watt was working as a deep sea fisherman, while Mr Dickie was a whisky distiller. From the very start they were inspired to brew American-style craft beers - sweet-tasting ales with high alcohol levels and very large amounts of US hops, which gave them a bold, fruity, even perfumed flavour. They are very Marmite beers in that you either love them or hate them. To fans they are flavoursome and interesting, to critics they are undrinkable. Yet, confident they could convert drinkers, and after some good reviews, Mr Watt and Mr Dickie decided to quit their day jobs and start brewing professionally in 2007. "Even though the first year was tough, we never lost faith in what we were doing," says Mr Watt. "We were hell-bent... we were stupidly ambitious." In addition to the bold flavours, the two men also worked hard on creating an irreverent brand image for BrewDog, giving their beers fun names, and bright, colourful labels. Some of their other brews are called Dead Pony Pale Ale, Dogma and Hardcore IPA. Expansion has been made possible after the business raised £7m via crowdfunding, with 15,000 people paying £95 for a stake in the company. In return they get discounts in BrewDog's bars, and other perks. In more controversial matters, Mr Watt and Mr Dickie have also regularly - and enthusiastically - attacked regulators and industry bodies. Their critics say they do so simply to garner publicity, but Mr Watt says they are merely sticking up for themselves. Earlier this year the Portman Group, the UK drinks industry trade body that promotes responsible drinking, criticised BrewDog, saying that the label of the brewery's Dead Pony Pale Ale promoted anti-social behaviour and binge drinking. BrewDog's response at the time was as follows: "Unfortunately, the Portman Group is a gloomy gaggle of killjoy jobsworths, funded by navel-gazing international drinks giants." When contacted by the BBC for this article, a spokesman for the Portman Group said: "BrewDog's business model has traditionally used complaints by the public as a PR opportunity for their brands. "BrewDog and the Portman Group have a long history... we don't expect them to like us, but we were pleased to see they have started relabeling their products." There are no hard and fast rules on what makes a "craft beer". However, typically it is a natural beer made by a small brewery, often with large amounts of pungent hops and a marked sweetness from the barley malt So what is the difference between "craft beer" and "real ale"? Unlike craft beer, real ale - as determined by UK pressure group Campaign For Real Ale - has to be unpasteurised and unfiltered. Real ale also more often has a drier flavour. Craft beer is also typically served well chilled and carbonated, whereas real ales are served less cold and have no added gas Yet, like lager (which itself can be a craft beer or real ale), they share the same basic four ingredients - malted barley, hops, yeast and water. In all cases other ingredients can be added on top, such as different grains A similar dispute that BrewDog had in 2013 with the UK's advertising watchdog, the ASA, saw Mr Watt call the officials "killjoy, self-important pen pushers". BrewDog has also been criticised for selling some beers with exceptionally high alcohol rates, such as a limited edition ale that was 55% alcohol. Mr Watt says that he and Mr Dickie - who together own a 75% share of the business - remain unrepentant, and simply "make beers that we want to drink ourselves". Mr Watt adds that BrewDog's products are bought by beer aficionados, and priced at a premium. He says that if someone is going to abuse alcohol they will be the cheaper, mass market beers that give drinkers "maximum bang for their buck". With exports now making up 65% of sales, Mr Watt says they have no plans to slow down the fast-paced growth. "My worry is that we aren't growing fast enough," he says.	When the founders of popular but controversial beer company BrewDog needed a second bank loan to enable them to expand production, their tactic was a simple one - lie through their teeth.
The boy had lived with the twin in his stomach his whole life, but went to hospital after complaining of pain. His mother told Bernama the foetus "was formed with organs like those of a baby". It is believed to be the first reported case of the condition, known medically as "fetus in fetu", in Malaysia. The boy's mother, 38, said funeral rites had been performed on the foetus and it was buried at a local cemetery. Reports said the foetus had legs, hands and genitals. "Only the nose and mouth were not complete," she said, saying she had accepted his fate. The teenager had been admitted to a local district hospital before being referred to the Sultan Abdul Hamid Hospital in Kedah for the operation to remove the twin. The hospital and Malaysia's government health officials would not comment on the case to the BBC. What is fetus in fetu? Dr S Raman, obstetrics and gynaecology specialist at Pantai Hospital in the capital, Kuala Lumpur, told the BBC it is when an "additional twin gets absorbed into the body of the living twin". "It's almost like a vanishing twin, or sometimes called a parasitic twin," he said. "I have actually seen a case of the foetus being attached to the outside of the living twin, so it's possible for the twin to be both inside or outside the body." There have also been cases of two twins found inside the abdomen of one child, in the case of a triplet pregnancy. What causes it? There is no known trigger, but it occurs in the early stages of development when one foetus wraps around the other. The enveloped twin then does not fully form but becomes a "parasite", relying on their host twin for their survival. Such twins usually die before birth. The abnormality is estimated to occur in 1 in 500,000 live births. Is it unusual to live so long with the twin? One widely reported case was of a 36-year-old man in India whose tumour had grown so big that he was having difficulty breathing. In villages or smaller towns where access to medical facilities are limited, it is possible for someone to not know they have a foetus and live with it their entire life, says Dr Raman. The abnormality is easily spotted if a baby undergoes an ultrasound or CT scan, and there have been cases of babies as young as three months old being operated on.	A 15-year-old Malaysian boy has had the parasitic foetus of his twin removed from his stomach, Malaysia's Bernama state news agency reports.
The figures come ahead of Wednesday's AGM where investors will quiz management over their plans for the Hinkley Point nuclear plant in the UK. EDF, 85% controlled by the French state, has struggled to find the cash for its 66.5% stake in the project. In April it pushed a final decision on the £18bn plant back to September. Chief financial officer Thomas Piquemal resigned in April following an internal disagreement over whether to press on with the controversial project. However, EDF has outlined plans to raise €4bn, with up to €3bn provided by the French government. Credit rating agencies are due to assess the group in the coming days and their verdict on its finances will determine how easy it will be for the group to raise cash. Meanwhile, tough market conditions mean EDF is cutting costs and planning to sell €10bn in assets by 2020, including a stake in French power-grid operator RTE. On Tuesday the new chief financial office Xavier Girre, said the management was not considering spinning off any part of the group to raise money. Its latest earnings report shows it has reduced its target for 2016 nuclear output to 408-412 terawatt-hour from 410-415. The scaling down of its output reflects continuing problems at its Paluel nuclear facility in France where a steam generator collapsed during maintenance. Sales fell 7% to €21.4bn in the first three months of the year, with sales in the UK down 9.8%. The company said its earnings forecast for 2016 remained on track.	French energy giant EDF says sales fell 7% in the first three months of the year in the face of stiff competition, a mild winter and lower energy prices.
Stuart Hamilton, 37, was last seen by his friends and family two weeks ago. Hamilton, from Gorgie in Edinburgh, was seen on CCTV at Haymarket Station on Sunday at 10:16. He then travelled by train to Manchester. He was then spotted by a former colleague near Buckingham Palace in London on Tuesday at 13:30. Mr Hamilton is white and of medium build. He is about 6ft 2in with short, dark, receding hair. He was last seen wearing a blue top along with a black hooded top, blue jeans and white trainers. He was also carrying a dark rucksack. Police Scotland has been working with Greater Manchester Police and the Metropolitan Police Service. Insp Jonathan Elliot, of Police Station, said:  "We are continuing our search for Stuart, which has now moved to London. "Anyone who knows Stuart's whereabouts in either Edinburgh, Manchester or London, or recognises his description, is asked to contact police immediately."	A missing man last spotted on CCTV footage taken at an Edinburgh train station has now been seen in central London.
BBC Radio Leicester reports the 24-year-old will join the Foxes for a fee of about £6m. Kante made 37 appearances for the French top-flight side last season, scoring two goals.

Leicester City are set to sign Caen midfielder N'Golo Kante for an undisclosed fee after he passed a medical at the Premier League club.
A urine sample showed the Australian, who rode at Royal Ascot last week, had the appetite suppressant Phentermine in her system when tested on 11 June. The sample was provided by Payne, 31, at the Swan Hill Cup meeting in Victoria. Racing Victoria stewards in Australia will hold an inquiry on Thursday. Payne has only just returned to Australia after she rode Kaspersky into fifth place in the Queen Anne Stakes at Royal Ascot on 20 June. She was advised of the test findings and stood down from riding in races and trackwork by stewards on 23 June. Payne made history in 2015 when she became the first female jockey to win the Melbourne Cup with Prince Of Penzance. After her victory, she made headlines with her comment:  "I want to say to everyone else, get stuffed, because women can do anything and we can beat the world." Her life story is being made into a film, produced and directed by actress Rachel Griffiths, who starred in Muriel's Wedding and Six Feet Under. Payne made her Royal Ascot debut last week after serious injury ruled her out of the previous year's meeting. She required surgery on her pancreas following a fall in May 2016 and spent a month in hospital.	Michelle Payne, the only female jockey to win the Melbourne Cup, has been stood down from riding after testing positive for a banned substance.
He set up a security agency, bringing together counter-terrorism and domestic intelligence under the authority of a single body. The king also replaced the head of the royal guard, and made several appointments to the team of his son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. In June, the 31-year-old prince became the first in line to the Saudi throne. He replaced the king's nephew, Mohammed bin Nayef, 57, who pledged allegiance to the younger cousin. The latest changes were announced in Thursday's decrees, published by the state-run SPA news agency. It said the decisions were made in order to maintain "the highest readiness levels to keep up with the latest developments". The new security agency is now headed by Abdulaziz bin Mohammed al-Howairini, a general who will be reporting directly to the 81-year-old king. Previously, the interior ministry was in charge of counter-terrorism and domestic intelligence. The new boss of the royal guard is Gen Suheil al-Mutiri, replacing Gen Hamad al-Awhaly. As part of the overhaul, King Salman also named Mohammed el-Kuwaiz as head of the agency that regulates investments in the oil-rich country.	Saudi Arabia's King Salman has issued a series of royal decrees, marking a new shake-up of top officials.
The law, which is set to become a world first, aims to close the wage gap between men and women. Companies face auditing and possible fines if they do not comply. Iceland was ranked first in the World Economic Forum's 2015 Global Gender Gap Index, followed by Norway, Finland and Sweden. However, according to Iceland's statistics for the same year, the unadjusted gender pay gap remained at 17%. The bill, which was presented on Tuesday, is supported by the centre-right coalition government and the opposition. Applying to both the public and private sector, it would prohibit any discrimination not just on gender, but also on race, religion, disability, occupational disability, age and sexual orientation grounds. "The bill entails that companies and institutions of a certain size, 25 or more employees, undertake a certification of their equal-pay programmes," Thorsteinn Viglundsson, the minister of social affairs and equality, told news agency AFP. The bill will now be subject to a series of debates, and if it passes, it will take effect from January 2018. In Iceland's parliament, nearly 50% of lawmakers are women, and a voluntary measure for equal pay across the country was introduced in 2012. However, many still do not think enough is being done. In October, thousands of women left work early and headed out on to the streets of the capital, Reykjavik, to protest against earning less than men. It echoed the 1975 Icelandic women's strike, when women did not go to their paid jobs, or do any housework or child-rearing at home for one day.	Iceland's parliament is examining a bill that would require companies to prove they offer equal pay to employees.
The women had been legally married for a few months after one of them passed as a man in front of an Islamic cleric who presided over their wedding. But suspicious neighbours confronted the couple and reported them to police. The two women are now back with their families, forcibly separated and under surveillance by the Islamic police. The local Sharia police chief told them Islam said they must be beheaded and burned for what they had done. But Aceh, the only province in Indonesia that is allowed to implement Sharia law, has yet to adopt any provisions dealing with gay and lesbian people. The provincial parliament passed Islamic laws authorising the stoning to death of adulterers and the caning of homosexuals in 2009, but the governor has refused to sign it. Homosexuality is frowned upon but legal in Indonesia. Activists have blamed Aceh's Sharia laws for encouraging vigilantism and intolerance, and say they violate the Indonesian constitution.	Islamic police in the Indonesian province of Aceh have forced two women to have their marriage annulled and sign an agreement to separate.
Douglas Carswell also told the BBC's Sunday Politics that the party needed to ensure it got the "tone" right in order to attract more voters. It comes after Mr Carswell said in an article in the Times on Saturday that Mr Farage "needs to take a break now". A bitter internal row has developed within UKIP after Mr Farage's resignation was rejected by the party. Mr Carswell said: "I'm suggesting he takes a break as leader. I'm not suggesting he takes a break from being leader. "Clearly the national executive has the authority, they're the ruling body. "I'm told that they made a decision. I'm told it was a procedurally correct decision, he is the leader but I think it's important that as leader he takes a break and I think it's important that we work out how these complex questions are answered by a team. "No one person has all the answers. I'm particularly concerned about tone, making sure we get a tone that ensures that the 27 million people who didn't vote for UKIP last week may be persuaded to vote for us in future." The party has been beset by wrangling since Mr Farage agreed to stay on as leader, days after standing down after failing to get elected in Thanet South. He had pledged before the general election that he would quit the post if he failed to get elected to Parliament. Senior aide Matthew Richardson has left the party, following claims from MEP Patrick O'Flynn that Mr Farage had fallen under the influence of "inexperienced" advisers. UKIP has also confirmed the departure of Mr Farage's chief of staff Raheem Kassam. Mr Farage ruled out quitting as leader on BBC's Question Time on Thursday, saying he had "phenomenal" support, and has challenged his critics to decide whether they want to stay in the party. In his article, Mr Carswell had said that "knowing how difficult it is to lead a party makes me admire Nigel Farage all the more". "I know that I never could," he added, stressing that he would find it "impossible to simultaneously lead UKIP, be the voice of the party in the Commons, represent my Clacton constituents and at the same time be a husband and a dad". However, he said that "even leaders need to take a break", adding: "Nigel needs to take a break now." UKIP got nearly four million votes at the election, but returned only one MP - former Conservative Mr Carswell in the Clacton constituency.	Nigel Farage should take a break "as leader" of UKIP but not a break from being leader, the party's only MP says.
The Californian singer has provided backing vocals for Stevie Wonder, Elton John, Josh Groban, Carole King, Robbie Williams and Rod Stewart in her stellar career. Most famously, she was due to be a featured singer on Michael Jackson's ill-fated This Is It tour in 2009 - and can be seen performing a spine-tingling duet with the star in the posthumous film of the rehearsals. She went on to appear on the US version of The Voice - where her shock elimination prompted judge Adam Levine to declare: "I hate this country". Hill's efforts to launch a solo career were then documented in the Oscar-winning film 20 Feet From Stardom - which turned the spotlight on the (mainly African-American) back-up singers who have propped up rock's biggest stars. But the catalyst for her solo career turned out to be Prince - who read about the star in a newspaper, and invited her to record an album at his Paisley Park Studios in Minneapolis. Hill tells the BBC about their collaboration, her experiences as a backing singer, and the day that Michael Jackson died. What's the first song you remember hearing? Walk With Me by Vanessa Bell Armstrong Who was the first person who told you you could sing? My mother was the first person to tell me I could sing.  She tells the story of how I was singing in the back car seat as a little girl, and she saw that I had talent.  We wrote our first song together when I was four. How did you land a job on Michael Jackson's This Is It tour? I did a small gig in Los Angeles and became friends with some musicians there.  One of them knew Michael's musical director and he invited me to audition. I did a small audition at the vocal director's house and a couple weeks later I was hired.  I remember them telling me, "Michael is on your Myspace page.  Change the picture!"  At the time, I was also hired to work at a clothing shop, so I quit that job and joined the This Is It tour. He was a master of stagecraft - what tips did he give you? Michael was fascinating to watch.  Working with him taught me the importance of seizing every moment on stage.  He painted pictures with every lyric and movement in his body. What do you remember of the day he died? I was sitting at a restaurant when my phone started blowing up.  There were rumours of his death but I didn't believe it.  It wasn't until later that day when this nightmare became a reality as I arrived at the Staples Center for rehearsal.  It was a very tragic day.   They had already begun to collapse the stage and pack up the gear.  Just the night before we were rehearsingâ€¦ It was surreal. What was it like to sing at the memorial service? It was an overwhelming experience. I mean, that was the same stage we rehearsed with him [on] two weeks prior. But it was a beautiful service. You were eliminated from the US version of The Voice - what did that experience teach you? When I was on The Voice, I made discoveries about my vocal style.  No matter what the song was, I always managed to turn it into a soul song whether I wanted to or not.  I learned that at the heart of it, I'm a soul singer.  My roots run deep, starting from the early days of jamming with my parents on Sly and the Family Stone and Curtis Mayfield songs. What difference did 20 Feet From Stardom make to your career? 20 Feet From Stardom was a special project that resonated with so many people.  We were honoured with an Oscar and Grammy and many wonderful opportunities have come my way because of it.   People were inspired by the stories in the film and they continue to follow my story to see what happens next. How much of a struggle was it to make the leap to solo artist? It's a very rough road - that 20 feet from being a backing singer to an artist is a long 20 feet! But what keeps me going is a passion for music. No matter what, it makes me happy to do it. What's the biggest difference between working as a backing vocalist and fronting your own material? Working as a backing singer is being a part of a group effort to give the artist what they need.  It's a fun community to be a part of.  Being a solo artist is a totally different experience.  There is more responsibility and pressure, yet it is very rewarding.  I love sitting in the driver's seat, directing everybody to achieve the sound I'm looking for.  There's nothing more fulfilling than making the sounds you hear in your head become a reality. Who's the most demanding artist you've sung for? The most demanding was Natalie Cole.  It was a short show, but she was very particular about how she wanted the vocals.  I have much respect for her.  She kept the singers on their toes! How did you end up working with Prince? I did an interview and was asked who is my dream collaborator.  I said "Prince!"  He saw the interview and personally reached out to me.  I remember receiving the unknown call on my cell phone and freaking out while I was talking to him.  I officially met him at his album listening party in Los Angeles.  Shortly after, he invited me to Paisley Park and that was beginning of the collaboration. He's got a wicked sense of humour... Has he ever caught you out with a prank? He once called me and I didn't recognize his voice because he pretended to be someone else.  He can do great impersonations. What did he contribute to your album? He's a fantastic producer and arranger.  He played many instruments, sang, arranged, and even wrote.  He was very involved in the process, yet it was a great collaboration between his ideas and my ideas.  Most of the songs were already written and he helped me come up with great grooves and effective edits. Why did you call it Back In Time? I wanted people to feel like they have travelled back into a golden era of funk/soul music.  For me, personally, this record celebrates my childhood and upbringing in a musical family.  Many of the lyrics are autobiographical - describing where I came from, my old stomping grounds, and the amazing musical community that inspired me along the way.  The whole record feels like a dusty jam session in the basement of my parents' house. What song means the most to you? Angel In The Dark.  I think about the many times I felt like I was trapped in a dark tunnel, yet God has always managed to rescue me at the right time.  He is that Angel in the dark. Judith Hill's debut album Back In Time is out now on NPG Records.	You may not have heard of Judith Hill, but you've almost certainly heard her voice.
The original game was postponed on 26 November because of a frozen pitch. The offer from the Latics is for both home and away supporters visiting SportsDirect.com Park. Oldham, who are next to bottom of the table, three points from safety, have just exited a transfer embargo and reappointed John Sheridan as manager. "We want as many supporters to welcome back the manager to the football club as he takes his place on the sidelines for the first time," said a club statement. Supporters are, however, being invited to make a donation to a local charity. Brentford were the first team to offer free entry for a league game in England when they played Peterborough in 2001.	Oldham Athletic have offered free entry to all fans for their rearranged League One fixture against Peterborough United on Tuesday, 24 January.
Yet again, you feel for the families of those killed on board, and the people that actually survived the ordeal. It seems never ending. In less than a year two Malaysian aircraft have been lost, with 537 people on board. The AirAsia accident - en route to Singapore in December - killed 162. It is not just the accidents. It's the fact that whole aircraft are going down without warning. You would be forgiven for thinking that flying is becoming more lethal. But you would be wrong. In fact, when you look at the number of crashes and fatalities compared to the huge number of people flying today (3.2 billion passengers last year), we are in a golden era of aircraft safety. According to safety analysts Ascend, 2014 was narrowly the safest year ever, with one fatal accident per 2.38 million flights, compared to every 1.91 million flights the year before. It must be noted that that does not include the loss of the Malaysian airliner over Ukraine, where 298 people died, which they count as a war loss rather than an accident. But even with that flight added it is not a terrible year, historically. Another respected organisation, the Aviation Safety Network, registers 21 fatal accidents in 2014 (this time including Ukraine), compared to 29 in 2013 and 23 the year before that. Nearly 1,000 people died in 2014, which is 700 more than the year before. Horrible numbers, but compare that to the worst year, 1972, when 2,370 passengers were killed - and far fewer people were flying then, maybe a quarter of the number travelling today. So why is flying getting safer? Well, technology. "Think of your car in the 1970s", David Learmount, from Flightglobal tells me. "The brakes, the handling, the lack of safety features. Well, aircraft are exactly the same. "We knew most things about aerodynamics by the 1940s. What has changed is the technology." Every new generation of aircraft has been safer than the one before. Better computers, design, materials. But there is another sobering factor at play here too. Every tragedy has taught designers something new. Go back a couple of decades and the biggest killer was something called Controlled Flight Into Terrain (CFIT). A benign name with a morbid outcome, it normally involved a perfectly serviceable aircraft coming into land, then hitting something on the ground without the crew even knowing it was there. Many airports are near hills. Then along came a piece of equipment that was to transform safety: the Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System. "It's like a sat nav that can help you thread your way through hills and mountains, even in clouds", David says. Here is another example of how disaster has led to safer flying. In 1985 a British Airtours aircraft was taking off from Manchester Airport, en route to Corfu. The pilots aborted at the last minute because one of the engines failed, but the aircraft was also on fire. Fifty-four people died fleeing the smoke, the aisles were jammed with passengers panicking to get out. Next time you fly, look at the floor. You will probably see strip lights along both sides of the aisle, then they turn and lead to each exit. That idea comes straight from the Manchester fire. The lights mean passengers can find the exit, even crawling on their hands and knees through thick smoke. "Our founder was actually working on emergency guide lights to help people escape from nuclear power stations and submarines," says Nigel Duncan, boss of STG aerospace. "This accident made him realise they could be used in planes too". Nigel's company now supplies guiding lights for the floors of 9,000 airliners. They are photoluminescent, "which means they are fail-safe". "It's a chemical process so they don't need power -  sever it and it still works," he says. For the most part, computers fly modern airliners. And they are very good at it. But all of this safety-driven automation has led to a new safety concern that is uncomfortable to hear. Pilots don't get enough practice at actually flying planes. The computer has taken them out of the loop. Six years ago, Air France flight 447 crashed into the Atlantic, killing 228 people. Yet there was nothing critically wrong with the plane. So why did it crash? Well, the weather was bad and a small tube froze up, knocking out the speed indicator. The actual speed was fine, but the speed data on their screens was all over the place. Suddenly, the computer didn't know how fast it was going, and it handed control back to the pilots. Confused, in bad weather, in darkness and taken by surprise, they couldn't work out what was happening, so they kept climbing to the point where the aircraft stalled, effectively stopping in mid-air and falling from the sky. Unsurprisingly, plenty in the industry want more hands-on training for pilots. "A few years ago the airlines used to get more crew from the military and those guys were used to manually flying aircraft right on the edge", David Learmount tells me. "Today, many pilots don't have that kind of background training." Having said all of that, just bear in mind: Nothing is ever without risk, but the chances of dying in an aircraft "accident" are lower than ever.	Yet again, we are looking at shocking pictures of a plane crash.
The Bath winger, 22, missed matches against France and Wales after injuring his hamstring in January. Head coach Eddie Jones said on Sunday that he was "confident" Watson would feature against Italy.

Media playback is not supported on this device Jean-Marc Bosman did not trademark any moments of skill, score famous late winners or carry his teams to success but he was good enough to win 20 youth caps for Belgium and break into the first team of one of his country's best clubs at 18. That, however, is not what earns him a place alongside Charlemagne, Audrey Hepburn and Hercule Poirot in a list of famous Belgians. Twenty years ago on Tuesday, Bosman emerged from the European Court of Justice with a win that turned Europe's top divisions into glorious expressions of multiculturalism and added a new noun to sport's lexicon: the Bosman. From that moment, players at the end of their contracts - David Beckham, Sol Campbell, Steve McManaman and many more - could move without a transfer fee. No longer would a player from the European Union have their opportunities in the single market curtailed by rules limiting the number of foreigners clubs could field. But for this softly spoken 51 year old, it was a case that almost ruined him. "There have been real problems but I am feeling much better now," said Bosman when I asked him how he was after a spell in prison, bankruptcy and a long battle with alcoholism. "I've had medical and psychological care and I also have blood samples taken on a regular basis. "There have been difficulties and my financial situation is not easy but life has started over. I have regained strength and feel motivated. "It has not been easy to find work after the ruling but I am not complaining. The tunnel is nearing its end." He entered that tunnel in 1990 when his contract with RFC Liege expired. With the club in financial trouble they wanted the midfielder to sign a new deal on a quarter of his former salary. Yet when Dunkerque, across the border in France, wanted to buy him, Liege demanded four times what they'd paid for him in the first place. "It was illogical," said Bosman, explaining the moment he decided to become a "freedom fighter". His lawyer thought it would take two weeks. It took five years; a period that should have been the best years of a decent career. Banned in Belgium, Bosman moved to a second division club in France, only for them to go bust. Other clubs told him they would like to sign him but could not because they already had three foreigners. He had a brief spell on the island of La Reunion and another go in the Belgian leagues, but it is an understatement to say his decision to take football's business model to court made him less attractive to club chairmen. Broke, tired and out of shape, he accepted 350,000 Swiss francs in damages for his legal victory and began a life after football that he is still trying to work out. There was a disastrous investment in a t-shirt business (he had hoped grateful footballers would buy one, only his lawyer's son did so) and problems with the taxman. In 2011, he was convicted of assault following claims he had been involved in an argument with his girlfriend after he asked her daughter to get him some booze.  Initially, the courts were lenient but when he failed to pay his fine they were left with little choice. He was sentenced to a year in prison in 2013. It was then that Fifpro, the international trade union for footballers, stepped in. The stars he had helped become multi-millionaires may have forgotten him but his union did not. "I was young and handsome then and I now have become old," he explained. "Most of the players won't be able to recognise me but my case is still being talked about - I think that is positive. "I may not be here in 20 years' time but they will still be talking about it and if someone remembers me I will give him my bank details. Everyone benefited from the Bosman ruling except me!" I am speaking to him at Fifpro's swish headquarters in a suburb of Amsterdam. Bosman has become a spokesman for the organisation's campaign to finish what he started: scrap transfer fees entirely. The best way to understand this is to view Bosman as a battle in a 125-year war between clubs and players. The players won Bosman but were "ambushed", in the words of Fifpro's general secretary Theo van Seggelen, six years later. The European Commission made a deal with the game's governing bodies, Uefa and Fifa, to stem what the clubs claimed was rampant "player power". This deal was enshrined in Fifa's Regulations on the Status and Transfer of Players in 2001. These rules set out today's transfer system - windows - the concept of a protected period when a contract cannot be broken, maximum and minimum contract lengths and so on - and for Fifpro they amount to the pendulum swinging towards the clubs. Five years later, a row about Scottish defender Andy Webster's move from Hearts to Wigan Athletic saw that pendulum swing back. The details of the case are convoluted but the final ruling seemed to fix what compensation a player/new employer should pay the old employer for breaking a contract outside of the protected period. This sum would be the wages the player would earn if he stayed. This really could have been revolutionary but two years later the Court of Arbitration for Sport changed the compensation equation by adding pro rata slices of the initial transfer fee and an estimate of the player's replacement cost. Players such Andrea Pirlo or Robert Lewandowski could still let their contracts expire to get Bosman moves to new teams and bigger wages. But clubs wanting to sign players still under contract, even outside the protected period, would have to cough up some compensation, as Manchester City did with Raheem Sterling last summer. Quite right too, is the usual response to this compromise between a player's right to ply his trade on the one hand, and a club's right to stability and a league's competitive integrity on the other. Everton manager Roberto Martinez, the first Spanish player to get a Bosman to England, has criticised the transfer window, but does not want to scrap compensation. "The Bosman ruling was a huge shock at the time but I used it and it now seems a normal way to move freely," said Martinez last week. "Football has benefited from the multicultural input of players and it seems normal now. "But it wouldn't be right to scrap transfer fees. The value of a footballer is important and the value of developing players is important." But Fifpro's Van Seggelen says this view is based on a misunderstanding of the players' position, as well as being unfounded in truth. Dr Stefan Szymanski, author of the best-selling Soccernomics and professor of sports management at the University of Michigan, did some research for Fifpro earlier this year which outlined how the system was failing to do any of the things it promised in 2001. According to Szymanski, the settlement has led to the rich clubs getting richer as more than half of all transfer spending circulates among them, with little trickling down the pyramid, far less than is syphoned off by agents. He also outlined how the same clubs and leagues keep winning, while the same types of clubs and leagues keep failing, leaving themselves, he says, vulnerable to match-fixing, third-party ownership and the trafficking of minors. "We thought the transfer system was finished on 15 December, 1995, but of course it isn't," explained Van Seggelen. "In fact, the situation is even worse than before. I often say to people 'how would you feel if you had to wait three months for your salary?' "You also have players waiting years for justice through the tribunal system, and even when he has a positive decision there is no enforcement system. We cannot accept that." That might win over a few more voters on the terraces but there will still be many in the "Bosman ruined football" camp who think this is simply a union fighting for more money for its members, and in this case the members are loaded. "Only 1% of our members are financially independent, so not every player is making that kind of money," said Van Seggelen. "We're not trying to make them richer. In an ideal world, every player would play at the level they belong. "I don't know why the clubs are so nervous. We are not trying to kill the top clubs or leagues. "Sport is unusual but it must be reasonable. It's an economic activity, a business, so it must respect the law." By this point, Bosman is outside smoking. Despite arriving late and looking like he could not wait for the interview to end, he was good company. He does not watch much football these days, he cannot afford the television subscriptions, but what he sees he enjoys. His main focus is looking after his two young boys and being a better dad to the grown-up daughter he has from an earlier relationship. "Martin and Samuel are too young to know about my case, I don't want to complicate their lives with it, they've just left kindergarten," he said. "But I think later, when they grow up, they could find out about what their dad has done for professional players on the internet and they will see their dad has done something good. "Back then clubs were selling hens, horses, mules and pigs, but not humans. "Players should be considered as workers, full stop, that's it! This is the Bosman ruling, and we ought to get back to it."	A Cruyff turn, Fergie time, the Matthews final: football's icons have often entered the language of the sport but can any of those greats claim to have changed the game as much as the nervous, middle-aged Belgian sitting in front of me?
The Fire and Rescue Service said they received a call just before 08:30 GMT on Thursday. The man was found dead in an upstairs bedroom, after fire crews arrived at the house in Drumgay Close, in the Kilmacormick area. They wore breathing apparatus and used thermal imaging cameras to locate the occupant. The Fire and Rescue Service are working to establish the cause of the fire.	A man has been found dead after a house fire in Enniskillen, County Fermanagh.
Company Sgt Maj Nelson Carter, 29, was awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross for his bravery in the Battle of the Boar's Head, in which he died on 30 June 1916. A memorial paving stone was unveiled in Eastbourne Pavilion Gardens and at the war memorial in Hailsham High Street. He was educated in Hailsham but lived most of his life in Eastbourne. He was survived by his daughter and wife, who accepted the Victoria Cross on his behalf from King George V. Councillor Pat Hearn, the mayor of Eastbourne, said: "Nelson Carter was a true hero who showed incredible bravery in leading his men under intense fire. "It's very fitting that we honour his memory almost 100 years to the day since his death and that his family and the people of Eastbourne will have the chance to remember him and the sacrifices he made." A plaque commemorating his life can be found on his home at 33 Greys Road, Old Town in Eastbourne. Hailsham mayor, Councillor Nigel Coltman, added that the town was proud to commemorate his "heroic actions and the commemorative stone will provide an enduring legacy for him".	A World War One soldier has been commemorated with the unveiling of two permanent memorials in the East Sussex towns where he lived and was educated.
The 40-year-old took over in 2012 and has guided Leigh to the Championship title in each of the past two years. They won just one game in The Qualifiers in 2015 as they missed out on a place in Super League. "It is with a heavy heart I have decided to resign as coach," said Rowley in a statement. "My reasons for leaving are personal and I will not comment further in public or in private."	Paul Rowley has resigned as Leigh Centurions head coach 10 days before the start of the 2016 Championship season.
The Yomper statue is currently located in front of the Royal Marines Museum at Eastney. The National Museum of the Royal Navy has started consulting over a proposed move to Portsmouth Historic Dockyard. Campaigners insist it is a local memorial to the conflict and "belongs" at Eastney. The Yomper statue was created by Philip Jackson, depicting a royal marine marching across the islands during the 1982 conflict and was unveiled by former prime minister, Lady Thatcher, in 1992. The National Museum of the Royal Navy (NMRN) is planning to relocate the Royal Marines Museum from Eastney to Portsmouth Historic Dockyard as part of a Â£13m lottery funded project and wants to take the statue with it. An online petition against moving the statue has attracted more than 1,800 signatories, saying it was "now considered as our local Falklands War Memorial". Sheila Mackie who set it up said: "The imposing scale of The Yomper needs space and adequate distance to be fully appreciated, and the visualization of the part in the major campaign that the statue represents couldn't be achieved in an interior space." Conservative-led Portsmouth City Council also voted to express a "clear preference" that the statue remain where it it is. Its motion stated: "The Yomper statue has graced the seafront for many years, serving as a reminder of both the Falklands War and of the Marines' historical association with Eastney." NMRN director Jon Rawlinson said the new museum site would potentially have 750,000 visitors a year, compared to 40,000 at the current museum. "He would be seen by far more people at the historic dockyard, but of course he was built for here [Eastney] and is part of here. " He said no decision had been made and it would consider all comments submitted to its public consultation.	Plans to move a statue depicting a Royal Marine in the Falklands conflict away from Portsmouth seafront have been criticised.
Ross, 39, has agreed a deal that runs initially until the summer of 2016. The former St Mirren defender has coaching experience from stints at Dumbarton and Hearts, where he departed in October. Ross will be in the dugout for Saturday's home match against the Buddies. Alloa are bottom of the Championship, three points adrift of Livingston, who they beat 1-0 on Saturday.	Scottish Championship strugglers Alloa Athletic have appointed Jack Ross as their new manager following the resignation of Danny Lennon.
According to the corporation, "the extended Ten will give audiences even more news analysis and explanation". With additional news from the Nations and Regions, the programme will be 45-minutes long from Monday through to Thursday, starting from 11 January. The move follows a five-month trial in the run-up to the General Election. "Along with its sister programme at 6, The BBC's 10 o'clock News is already the most popular news bulletin in the UK and, in the New Year, it will offer even more," said Gavin Allen, controller of daily news programmes. "Viewers will continue to see the fullest range of stories - and now we'll have still more scope to explain the events that impact the country and help to make sense of the changing world around us." It's always been a bit odd that the BBC's highest profile news bulletin (if not highest rated - the audience for the Six o'clock News is bigger) has also been the shortest. Of course, the official duration hasn't always been stuck to. People who tune in just for the weather at the end of the bulletin will already know this - the news is sometimes two, three or even five minutes longer than it says on the schedules. It is, though, an interesting symbolic move. ITV's News at Ten presenter Tom Bradby has questioned the BBC scheduling its main news at 10pm, and so too has the culture secretary John Whittingdale. This certainly makes clear the BBC isn't planning on vacating the spot, but is digging in even deeper. Yet it does present a quandary for those who like to tuck in to Newsnight after the Ten.  Newsnight's start time is usually around 22:32. In future, if you stay with the News at Ten until the end of the weather, you will have missed the first 13 minutes of the programme. And finally, for fans of the red chair and the celebrity sofa, this is a Monday to Thursday-only change. Question Time on Thursday can be shunted, but Graham Norton, it appears, is sticking to his 22:35 slot.	The BBC's News at Ten is to run 10 minutes longer in the New Year, with the bulletin set to end at 22:45 GMT on every weekday except Friday.
Two armed men wearing masks broke into the 44-year-old victim's house in Meadowbank Terrace at about 00:50. During the assault the men knocked the victim to the ground and hit him repeatedly with a blunt object before fleeing the property. Police Scotland have appealed for witnesses. The first attacker was white with a pale complexion, in his early 20s, 5ft 10ins tall and had dark hair growth on his face, brown eyes and dark unkempt hair. He was of skinny build and was wearing a light grey cotton zip-up tracksuit with the hood up, grey gloves, white Reebok classics-style trainers with air holes and a grey scarf. The second attacker is in his early to mid 20s, between 5ft 6ins and 5ft 8ins tall and of skinny build. He spoke with a local accent. He was wearing an old, black, waist-length outdoor jacket with a dark scarf covering his face and his hood up. He was wearing dark gloves. Det Insp Alan O' Brien, of Police Scotland, said "This is a particularly vicious attack on a disabled man in his own home and we would ask anyone who saw or heard anything suspicious in the Meadowbank Terrace area in the early hours of Monday morning is asked to contact police immediately. "In addition, anyone with any information that can help us with our inquiries and assist in tracing the men responsible should also get in touch."	A disabled man has been left with serious injuries after being attacked in his own home in Edinburgh.
Under a law aimed at reducing prison overcrowding, senior citizens (Mr Berlusconi is 77) convicted of certain crimes can choose between house arrest and performing some socially useful task. Ordinary criminals can be assigned by the courts to work in centres for drug addicts, or soup kitchens for the homeless, or looking after the elderly. But Mr Berlusconi is no ordinary criminal. He normally travels surrounded by a cohort of bodyguards - which might slightly impede any voluntary work he undertakes. He and his media companies also employ a small army of lawyers. Notwithstanding his final conviction by Italy's highest criminal court, the former prime minister still maintains that he is the innocent victim of politically biased judges. Nonetheless, he still faces a possible ban on holding public office, and later this month will almost certainly be stripped of his seat in the Senate. He was due to begin serving his sentence this week, but bureaucratic delays in the Italian judiciary are legendary. It now appears that no decision will be made by the authorities for at least six months as to how he is to pay off his debt to society. The media mogul can propose what organisation he would like to join, but there is no guarantee that he will be assigned to the charity or the soup kitchen of his choice. The Italian media has had a field day reporting serious, and less-than-serious, offers. A street circus in Naples offered him a chance to go on stage and tell his own jokes. Mr Berlusconi loves to entertain his friends in private with songs, and with jokes that are sometimes notoriously off-colour. He began life as a crooner on board a cruise ship and he has written lyrics for his own songs composed and recorded by his close friend Mariano Apicella, a Neapolitan entertainer. A human rights group suggested that Mr Berlusconi could help them lobby international organisations for the abolition of the death penalty in countries where criminals are still executed. A city in the north offered Mr Berlusconi a desk and an office to counsel business owners suffering from the economic recession. Gino Strada, founder of Emergency, an Italian humanitarian organisation that provides medical services in war zones, including Afghanistan and Sudan, said Mr Berlusconi would be welcome to offer his services to them - although he added that perhaps they would keep him away from their accounts department. Meanwhile, a new way out for Mr Berlusconi has appeared on the horizon. President Giorgio Napolitano is urging the government to pass a new amnesty law aimed at reducing the severe overcrowding in Italy's prisons, and Mr Berlusconi's supporters are hoping that the measure might stretch to cover commuted sentences such as that given to the former prime minister. For now, it is unclear whether the proposed amnesty could cover Mr Berlusconi's community service, and it may be several months before the bill is decided on. Reform minister Gaetano Quagliarello, who belongs to Mr Berlusconi's Freedom Party, says it would be "unthinkable" to exclude him from a measure that applies to all Italian citizens. Justice Minister Anna Maria Cancellieri, on the other hand, said last week she did not think Mr Berlusconi could benefit from the measure.	Former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi - whose four-year sentence for tax fraud has been reduced to 12 months under an amnesty - has submitted a formal request to perform a year of community service, instead of being confined to the gilded cage of one of his luxury homes under house arrest.
The fields affected, and another eight associated platforms, produce about 10% of the UK's oil output. Hydrocarbons were detected inside a leg of the Cormorant Alpha platform. Its operator, Taqa Bratani, has removed non-essential workers as a precaution and said the leak had been contained. Shutting down the platform affects the whole Brent pipeline system. The oil leak at Cormorant Alpha was discovered on Monday and non-essential crew were taken off the installation by helicopter. Taqa, also known as Abu Dhabi National Energy, said nothing had leaked into the sea and a technical team was investigating the source. Taqa said on Wednesday afternoon that it was "currently evaluating plans to restore the throughput of an estimated 80,000 barrels per day in the Brent pipeline, excluding any Cormorant Alpha production." A spokesperson said: "This action would occur after thorough technical assurance has established that it can be undertaken safely and without any increased risk." The BBC understands the rest of the Brent pipeline system can no longer operate because Cormorant Alpha, which is situated some 94 miles from Lerwick in Shetland, is a crucial pumping station. Eight other platforms have shut down with up to 27 North Sea fields affected. The Dunlin, Thistle, Northern Producer, Murchison, North Alwyn, Tern, Eider and North Cormorant platforms are also affected. Oil and Gas UK - the offshore industry body - said oil transported through the Brent pipeline system represented 10% of the UK's North Sea oil production. The amount of output affected is 90,000 barrels per day. It is not yet known what potential impact the shut down could have on petrol station prices. However Prof Alex Kemp, an oil economist at the University of Aberdeen, said the closure would have a limited impact on oil prices. He told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme: "What we have is an incident which impacts on the Brent pricing system which is used as a marker price for a lot of the world's production. "If it continues one would expect a limited affect on the Brent price. "But the Brent price doesn't just depend on Brent production, it depends on production from a lot of other fields. "The effect should be limited because although the Brent price is the marker for a huge volume of oil in the world market, Brent production constitutes not all that big a proportion of the total." Enterprise Minister Fergus Ewing said: "The Scottish government, including Marine Scotland, are monitoring this situation closely. "No release of hydrocarbons has been reported and all non-essential staff on the platform have been safely removed. "The Health and Safety Executive are investigating and will determine when the pipeline system can be opened again subject to any relevant safety measures being put in place." He said the loss "does not impact security of supply at this time".	A pipeline system servicing up to 27 oil fields has been shut down after a leak on the Cormorant Alpha platform, north-east of Shetland.
The serious case review into events at Winterbourne View, near Bristol, comes after 11 ex-staff members admitted offences against patients. Owners Castlebeck took "financial reward without the responsibility", the report's author Margaret Flynn said. South Gloucestershire Council said it "fully accepted" the findings. Castlebeck said the criticisms in the report were being "actively addressed". The independent report also revealed concerns were raised before the abuse was uncovered in a secretly-filmed investigation by the BBC's Panorama programme. The safety of dozens of patients was raised but the NHS was only informed about a handful of cases. From the opening of the hospital in 2006 until 2011, there were 38 safeguarding alerts raised about 20 patients from the unit. Only one in five of those was reported to the NHS. Three alerts the NHS does not appear to have been notified of in any way - an allegation of abuse by staff, concerns about the attitude of some staff, and an allegation of assault by a member of staff. Peter Murphy, the head of South Gloucestershire Safeguarding Adults Board, said he wanted to convey his "deep regret" for what had happened at the hospital. "In particular, I would like to express our regret to the hospital's patients and to their families, friends and carers," he said. "Winterbourne View hospital should have been a safe place for them to be treated with care and compassion. "But the hospital's owners, Castlebeck Care Ltd, failed to provide that care." Margaret Flynn, the report's author, said Castlebeck had "promoted an unworkable management structure" and relied on "poorly paid and untrained staff". She added the firm did not "act on the concerns, complaints of Winterbourne View visitors or patients". The Panorama programme, aired in May last year, showed "compelling images" of patients being slapped and restrained under chairs, having their hair pulled, and being held down as medication was forced into their mouths, Ms Flynn said. By Matthew HillBBC West health correspondent With the increasing use of the private sector delivering care to  patients, Winterbourne View raises fundamental questions about whether their safeguards are as robust as the NHS. It's emerged from the serious case review that unlike NHS hospitals, private institutions like Winterbourne have no electronic system to report so-called 'Serious Untoward Incidents'. Even on the rare occasions when primary care trusts were told about these concerns by social or health workers, they were not reported to the body charged with spotting patterns of abuse - the Strategic Health Authority. If they had been, then the scandal  could have been revealed before the BBC filmed undercover. It remains to be seen whether the Department of Health will address this question, when they give their report into Winterbourne View. She said patients had been "traumatised and remain very distressed that they were not believed". But she was also critical of "out of sight, out of mind" commissioning by primary care trusts when placing patients in Winterbourne View. Castlebeck, the report added, "appears to have made decisions about profitability, including shareholder returns, over and above decisions about the the effective and humane delivery of assessment, treatment and rehabilitation". The average weekly fee per patient was Â£3,500, but Castlebeck did not tell the review how this was spent. Ms Flynn said the turnover at Winterbourne View alone was Â£3.7m a year. She said the staff were "chronically bored" in their roles at the hospital, which was "poorly managed". A spokesman for Castlebeck said: "We hope that the lessons learned and the actions that flow from this rigorous report will mark the start of a new chapter for care in our sector. "The actions towards people with learning disabilities by former members of staff at Winterbourne View Hospital were both wholly unacceptable and deeply distressing for all concerned and we are truly sorry this happened in one of our services." He said significant changes had been made within their organisation that included extensive changes to board membership, all new operations structures, strengthened clinical governance and increased staff training and development. "Importantly, we are determined to ensure that each of the persons for whom we care and their family are firmly at the heart of everything we do," he said. Avon and Somerset Police were also criticised for not informing South Gloucestershire Adult Safeguarding of all their contacts with the hospital. Det Ch Supt Louisa Rolfe, head of CID at the force, said there were 29 calls and nine incidents over a period of nearly three years relating to Winterbourne View, and agreed a pattern should have been noticed. She said investigating officers had "overly relied on people perceived as professionals and experts in their field" at the hospital, for information. David Behan, chief executive of the Care Quality Commission, said: "There is much for all the organisations involved with Winterbourne View to consider in Margaret Flynn's thorough and comprehensive report. "I will ensure that the Care Quality Commission responds fully to all the recommendations for CQC. "We will continue to work with other organisations to improve communications and sharing information to ensure we all protect those who are most vulnerable." Dr Gabriel Scally, who chaired the NHS review panel, said: "The most striking thing - apart from the sheer horror of what was done to patients - is that even though lots of different people knew bits of what was going on, nobody put it all together and did anything about it. "That is most disturbing. "We should take this opportunity to look at reporting systems and make sure a system is in place so when incidents happen they are properly reported and investigated." Anne Milton, parliamentary under-secretary of state for public health, said primary care trusts had spent money "recklessly" putting patients in Winterbourne View. She said changes were being made to make it the responsibility of those commissioning care to ensure quality is a priority. The report was published as two organisations warned that moving people hundreds of miles away from their families increased the risk of abuse taking place. Mencap and the Challenging Behaviour Foundation said they had received 260 reports from families concerning abuse and neglect in institutional care since the Panorama programme was broadcast. Eleven former workers at the private hospital have pleaded guilty to almost 40 charges of abuse and are due to be sentenced later at Bristol Crown Court.	Fundamental changes are needed in how care of vulnerable adults is commissioned and monitored, a report into abuse at a private hospital said.
Tait, who picked up a medal alongside Kate Hornsey in the women's pair, was diagnosed with cervical cancer in 2013. Australian Rowing head coach Chris O'Brien said: "Sarah has been, and will continue to be, an inspiration to many Australian rowers. "She was a strong role model to young athletes, and particularly influential with our emerging female athletes." Tait and Hornsey finished behind Great Britain's Heather Stanning and Helen Glover in the 2012 pairs final, which was GB's first gold of London 2012. Glover became friends with Tait following the final and told BBC World Service she was an "incredible personality". She added: "To achieve so much in her too short life - two beautiful children, a husband, an Olympic silver medal, the list goes on. "Above all that, she was an inspirational and truly lovely person that has paved the way for women in sport at home in Australia and all over the world."	Australian rower Sarah Tait, who won silver at the London Olympics in 2012, has died aged 33.
The pound has gained 1% and although the stock market is down more than 2%, a lot of that happened before Theresa May called a snap election for 8 June. Still, market watchers are reading the tea leaves and have made a few observations. Since the big fall in sterling after the referendum result, the pound has tended to rise at times when a softer Brexit has looked more likely and vice versa. Today's rise in the pound suggests markets are betting that Theresa May will (a) win and (b) win a bigger majority than she currently has, which (c) will make her less dependent on hardline Eurosceptics in her own party. The theory goes that all this will allow her room to deliver a softer Brexit, which will be less of a shock to the economic system - hence the pound strengthens. The stock market is falling because most of the UK's largest companies make their money in foreign currencies. As the pound rises, those foreign earnings are worth less in sterling terms. That is the way markets are reading it today, but as we know, markets can be pretty terrible at reading politics and it is certainly not a done deal that Theresa May will use any consolidation of her position as an opportunity to peddle a softer line on Brexit. One thing an election in June does give her - if she wins - is more breathing room. She will be under less pressure to deliver a "clean" Brexit in 2019 without the deadline of another election in 2020 bearing down on her. Facing the country again while possibly still enmeshed in tortuous negotiation (with potentially little control over immigration by then) was an unappealing political prospect. Business groups have been broadly supportive of the move. All other things being equal, businesses prefer the additional certainty that a government with a larger majority can provide. The EEF said "a fresh and stable mandate from the country can only provide greater certainty about the future direction of travel for policy", while the CBI had a cooler response, saying: "Distraction from the urgent priorities of seeking the best EU deal and improving UK productivity must be kept to a minimum." While it's true that this election is a further complication to an already mind-bogglingly complex situation, very little can meaningfully be achieved in negotiations until after elections in France, Germany and possibly Italy. Everyone else seems to be having an election, so we might as well have one here while the political and economic going is good. The economy has defied the gloomy prognosis that many, including the Treasury and the Bank of England, gave before the referendum. Average wages are rising a smidgeon faster than prices (although this is expected to change imminently) and there are a record number of people in work. The economic window for this political gamble is open.	Markets don't generally like surprises and today's announcement certainly qualified as one, but the market reaction has so far been fairly calm.
The African champions let in goals from Kerem Demirbay and Timo Werner, who netted twice, while Vincent Aboubakar grabbed a consolation goal for them. The Indomitable Lions also had Ernest Mabouka sent off after confusion involving the Video Assistant Referee. Sebastien Siani was initially dismissed in a case of mistaken identity before the error was corrected. Colombian referee Wilmar Roldan consulted the VAR after a high challenge by Mabouka on Germany's Emre Can led to Cameroon captain Siani wrongfully receiving a yellow card. However, the initial outcome was to switch the colour of Siani's card to red. It was only after Cameroon's players insisted he review the incident again that he realised his error, rescinded Siani's dismissal and sending off the correct culprit Mabouka. "The referee didn't give any explanation," said Cameroon coach Hugo Broos. "First of all he gave a red card against Siani, then the video ref called him back and told him it was the wrong player, so Mabouka was sent off. "Both players [Can and Mabouka] had their legs high, so I don't see why he had to give a red card. I think everyone is confused "I didn't understand it and I still don't understand it now. "I think this is something for the referee. He and he alone can explain what happened in that incident." As Group B winners, Germany will face Mexico in the last four in Sochi, Russia. Portugal will play Chile in the other semi-final.	Cameroon's Confederations Cup campaign is over after a 3-1 defeat by Germany in their final Group B game on Sunday.
It began on Friday when Ramzan Kadyrov, leader of the southern Russian republic, labelled opponents of President Vladimir Putin "enemies of the people" and called for such "traitors" to be prosecuted for subversion, claiming they were working in league with the West. Mr Kadyrov has now re-asserted his claims and gone even further in an online editorial for pro-Kremlin newspaper Izvestia. Referring to a "half-witted rabble", he offered opposition activists the services of a Chechen psychiatric hospital to treat their "mass psychosis". "I promise we won't spare the injections. We can do double," he wrote. A boxer-turned-insurgent and now a self-styled "foot soldier" of President Putin, the man known simply as Ramzan is not someone many in Russia dare criticise openly. Human rights groups have long accused him of presiding over widespread abuses in the Russian republic, and the key suspect in last year's shock shooting of opposition politician Boris Nemtsov beside the Kremlin walls had been deputy commander of one of his elite battalions. He was referred to by Ramzan as a "true patriot". This time, the Chechen leader's comments appear to have touched a nerve. The most dramatic response came from a little-known independent politician in Siberia, who raged against Ramzan on his Facebook page as the "shame of Russia". "Why don't you get lost?" Konstantin Senchenko told him, and let "normal, honest people" work for the good of the country. But the Siberian was soon eating his "hasty" words. The next day, he apologised profusely on Facebook for his "discourtesy", apparently after multiple calls from Chechnya. Cartoons of his sudden change of heart soon spread on social media, depicting him begging forgiveness with a gun to his head. In an ultimate humiliation, the shamefaced politician was seen in a video clip apologising personally to Ramzan for his "emotional outburst". Activists on Twitter then took up the Siberian's insult with the hashtag #KadyrovshameofRussia. Well-known opposition journalists followed that by filming themselves making fake, grovelling apologies to Ramzan "for existing". One was filmed running on a treadmill with no trousers, just as a young Chechen man was forced to do recently after criticising Ramzan Kadyrov on Instagram. Meanwhile, a group of prominent Russian liberals has begun gathering signatures demanding his resignation, and a St Petersburg politician has called on prosecutors to examine his statements for extremism. But the backlash has only increased the tirade from Chechnya, where local politicians have been falling over themselves to express devotion to their leader. None has outdone the speaker of parliament, Magomed Daudov, who posted a photograph of his boss holding back his huge, fierce dog on a leash and warned that Tarzan's teeth were "itching" - naming four well-known opposition figures whom the hound would presumably love to sink them into. "Tarzan has become very frisky. We can barely restrain him," wrote the speaker in an Instagram post that attracted over 6,000 likes. "Just imagine what would happenâ€¦ If it weren't forâ€¦ Democracy." There is some talk that this is all a show of strength by the Chechen leader: a reminder of the considerable forces at his disposal amid talk of a power struggle between Grozny and Moscow. But the Kremlin has remained tight-lipped throughout, prompting others to conclude that it more likely endorses Ramzan's actions. Parliamentary elections are due later this year and, with an economy battered by falling oil prices, there's concern that opposition groups could capitalise on potential social unrest. "It's a message to all of those who don't agree with what's happening," argues former oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is now an opposition activist in exile and himself one of the obvious targets of Ramzan Kadyrov's ire. "The authorities are afraid and they decided to frighten society," wrote Mr Khodorkovsky on his blog. Another commentator has suggested that the Chechen leader simply wants to underline his loyalty to Moscow ahead of a wave of forced budget cuts and to ensure that the generous flow of federal subsidies to Chechnya does not stop. Whatever the motive, the practice of singling out traitors is seen as particularly dangerous in the wake of Boris Nemtsov's murder. A year ago, Putin loyalists were still beating the drum of patriotism following the annexation of Crimea from Ukraine; state TV was lashing out viciously at Kremlin critics; warnings that Ukraine-style revolutions would not be tolerated were rife. Ramzan Kadyrov's latest outburst has resurrected the idea of an enemy within and the search for a scapegoat. "The situation is very tense now," Mr Senchenko, explained by phone from Krasnoyarsk, pointing to Russia's mounting economic problems. That concern is what motivated his own Facebook rage against Chechnya's leader. "Some people really think there are enemies of the state and it's not clear what can enter their heads," he warned.  "So we need to be careful."	Traitors, jackals and vile liberals are just a few of the choice descriptions of Russia's opposition emerging from Chechnya in recent days, in a war of words that threatens to escalate.
Land and Housing Minister Anna Tibaijuka had not shown "due diligence" when she took the money, he said. Ms Tibaijuka, a former UN official, denies any wrongdoing. She is a high-profile casualty in a corruption scandal that has rocked Tanzania's government and energy firms, straining relations with donors. On 17 December, Attorney-General Frederick Werema resigned after MPs accused him of authorising the fraudulent transfer of about $120m to an energy firm. He denied the allegation, but said he was stepping down because the controversy had "disrupted the country's political atmosphere". Mr Kikwete, in a televised address, said the government was still investigating allegations of impropriety against Energy and Minerals Minister Sospeter Muhongo and his permanent secretary Eliakim Maswi. The president's office later said that Mr Maswi had been suspended, pending the outcome of the probe. Ms Tibaijuka rejected parliament's call for her resignation, saying the $1m was a donation for a school where she serves as the main fundraiser. She accepted it in good faith and presented it to the school, she said. However, Mr  Kikwete said he had dismissed her because "one of the biggest questions raised is why this money was not paid directly to the school and was instead deposited in a personal bank account in her name," Reuters news agency quotes him as saying. Ms Tibaijuka was the executive director of the United Nations Human Settlements Programme, before she became an MP and government minister in 2010. Tanzania's parliament, which is dominated by the ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) party, has been putting pressure on Mr Kikwete to sack top officials accused of siphoning government money in collusion with businessmen linked to the energy sector. An investigation by a parliamentary watchdog committee found that about $120m had been taken from an escrow account, paid to an energy firm and then given to various government ministers. A group of 12 donors - including Japan, the UK, the World Bank and the African Development Bank - decided in October to withhold about $490m until the government took action over the alleged corruption. Mr Kikwete took office in 2005 with a promise to tackle corruption in government.	Tanzania's President Jakaya Kikwete has fired a senior government minister accused of wrongly taking $1m (Â£640,000) from a businessman.
In his regular BBC Sport column, football pundit Robbie Savage looks at why Liverpool look a long way off repeating last season's title challenge, how they should line up against Chelsea and the physical and mental battle Steven Gerrard faces to secure a long-term future with the Reds. It is only six months since Steven Gerrard's slip helped the Blues clinch a famous win on Merseyside that derailed Liverpool's title bid. Back then, at the end of April, the title was in the Reds' grasp. This weekend, I think we will see again how far away they are from mounting another title challenge. They are miles away from the level required for that, and will have to improve and work hard just to get in the top four. If they manage it, then securing back-to-back seasons in the Champions League should be seen as success for Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers. But not all their fans see it that way. I had some unhappy Reds supporters calling me up on  606 on BBC Radio 5 live last weekend to give their manager stick. Part of Liverpool's problem is that they overachieved massively last season, which has raised expectations unrealistically. That is not Rodgers' fault. Where he can be questioned is in the transfer market, especially up front. Between them Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge scored 52 of Liverpool's 101 Premier League goals last  season. With Suarez sold and Sturridge playing only three out of 10 league games so far this season because of injury, Rodgers has lost a lot of goals from his line-up. But he has had money to spend and I do not think he has bought the right strikers to fit his system. Looking at Rodgers' options up front for Saturday, Mario Balotelli, Rickie Lambert and Fabio Borini are his three available front men, and the bottom line is that they are not good enough. It is not just that they do not look like scoring. There is a big difference in their work-rate compared to what Suarez and Sturridge gave the team. That means Liverpool are not starting games with the same intensity they did last season, or pressing teams high up the pitch to force them into mistakes. Doing that in 2013-14 Liverpool scored 59 first-half goals, 13 more than any other team, and scored in the first half of 34 out of 38 league matches - again the most in the top flight. In their first 10 games of this campaign, they have only managed a total of four goals before half-time, in three different matches. Instead of being on the front foot, they are having to chase games. They look pedestrian and that is not just the centre-forward's fault. When I have watched them, no matter what formation they play, they do not seem to have any runners going past their striker from midfield. Again, last season that used to happen all the time, but I was at St James' Park last weekend to  co-commentate on their defeat by Newcastle, and the only player to run beyond Balotelli in the first half was Gerrard, who did it once. Another problem is set-pieces. Liverpool were lethal from them last year, scoring with more than any other top-flight team. More than a third of their goals in 2013-14 came from corners or free-kicks, at a rate of almost one a game. That has dropped off dramatically. Sadly for Rodgers, seeing the goals drying up is not his only problem. Liverpool's defence was seen as their weakest link last season and, despite trying several different combinations, he did not get it right. From Mamadou Sakho for £18m in 2013 to Dejan Lovren for £20m this summer, Rodgers has thrown a lot of money at the problem but is still trying to find an answer. They still look all over the place at the back. Statistically, they are no worse defensively than last season - but they are also no better. Liverpool play and complete as many passes as before, and also keep as much possession. But with them no longer being able to outscore the opposition, it is no surprise their results have been affected. What Liverpool lack at the back is a leader, and their goalkeeper does not give them much help there. Simon Mignolet is clearly an excellent shot-stopper but I don't see him coming off his line enough, or commanding his box. Rodgers tried three at the back against the Magpies, but I cannot see him doing the same against Chelsea. He was criticised for resting players against Real Madrid on Tuesday but I agreed with him for doing it. Liverpool can still qualify for the knockout stages in Europe if they win their last two games in Group B and their weakened team actually did better against Real in Spain than the full-strength side he picked at home. Now he has to decide who to play against Chelsea, but whoever he picks, Liverpool will need to show a huge improvement on their recent displays. My team to face Liverpool: Mignolet, Johnson, Skrtel, Toure, Moreno, Can, Gerrard, Sterling, Coutinho, Lallana, Borini. For me, Lovren is the big signing who makes way, with Kolo Toure keeping his place after doing well at the Bernabeu. It is a big call to drop Lovren when Rodgers has spent so much money on him, but he has just not been good enough. It is hard to see Liverpool winning on Saturday because Chelsea are on a different planet He was poor against Newcastle and has been poor all season. Although he has got the height that Liverpool will need to defend set-pieces against Chelsea, I saw him get bossed around by Bobby Zamora when Liverpool played QPR at Loftus Road. You have to think that Diego Costa would make mincemeat of him if he is up front for Chelsea. To compete, Liverpool will need a solid four in the middle, with their full-backs looking to join the attack. Whether it be Glen Johnson on the right or Alberto Moreno on the left, when one goes forward, then the other should sit back. That way, Liverpool will always have five defensive players to guard against Chelsea's counter-attacks. Going forward, they need their full-backs to contribute in the same way they did last season when they overlapped down the flanks or broke forward with speed. The trio of Adam Lallana, Philippe Coutinho and Raheem Sterling as attacking midfielders provide pace, trickery and creativity and, leading the line, Borini gives more energy than Lambert or Balotelli. He will have to work hard down the channels to keep Chelsea's defence busy. Even if all of that works, however, it is still hard to see Liverpool winning on Saturday because Chelsea are on a different planet to every other Premier League team at the moment. Jose Mourinho's side have not been at their best in the last couple of games but they have not lost any of them either. The only way you would describe their form as disappointing would be in comparison to the way they started the season, when they were electric. The Blues do not seem to have a weakness and, just like in April, I see them leaving Anfield with three points. There is no title on the line this time, but it will still hurt the home fans. Whatever happens on Saturday will not make up for what was probably the worst moment of Gerrard's career. He may never make up for it, but there is no way he is finished. He was Liverpool's best player against Newcastle and, despite it still being uncertain whether he will get a new Reds contract in the summer, I definitely see him as being part of their longer-term future. Playing in that defensive midfield role, he can remain competitive in the Premier League. I cannot see him being allowed to leave Anfield but, if he does, he will end up at another top club. The older you get, the harder you have to work, though, and extending his career will be a mental battle as well as a physical one. At 34, he does not have to prove he can ping a ball 60 yards, deliver a great free-kick or make a crunching tackle. What he has to show is that he can still get about the park well enough to do all of those things effectively. Because, whether he likes it or not, every time he has a bad game he will hear the accusation that "his legs have gone". Of course he is still fit and can still run. He is probably one of the fittest players at Liverpool. At 36, when I was at Derby, I was still in the top two or three players whenever we did the bleep test. What happened against Chelsea last time probably destroyed Gerrard on the inside But it is the recovery that will test him. When you are flying, you can close someone down, then charge into the next challenge or situation. As you get older, it is harder to get to the next man in time to make a difference. That is what people mean when they say your legs have gone. There is nothing worse as a high-energy midfield player to know that, two or three years ago, you could have made that next challenge - and now you can't. I knew it when it happened to me. I would try not to think it but you cannot escape it and it was horrendous. I began to doubt myself and whether anybody would want me to play for them. What does not help is what other people say. Managers and players told me I was finished but I had to keep believing in myself. I knew I was not the player I was, but I still felt I had something to offer. For me, Gerrard undoubtedly does too. Along with Sterling and Sturridge he is still one of Liverpool's most important players. Of all the players I faced in my career, he was the one I would have loved to have played with. He was a nightmare to play against because he had everything. At his peak he was the best midfielder the Premier League has seen. Saturday will be a difficult occasion for him because what happened against Chelsea last time probably destroyed him on the inside. Of course he will be thinking about it before the game - he must think about it all the time - but he has not let it stop him. It would have been easy for him to quit after a disappointment like that, but he has kept going like he always does. It is that kind of desire that will keep him going beyond the end of this season too. Robbie Savage was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan	Chelsea's return to Anfield on Saturday brings back unhappy memories for Liverpool and their immediate future is not much brighter either.
Although there is some scepticism surrounding the claim, the international community has condemned the action. The news has also prompted reaction, particularly on social media. Since the news broke 'North Korea' has been mentioned 211,000 times on Twitter and has been among the top trending topics worldwide. So what can be done to prevent North Korea's move escalate to an international crisis? Here are some of your ideas. @martinedobor tweets there should be greater agreement on weapons: It's saddening and worrying that North Korea says that it carried out an H-bomb test. That claim must be taken seriously by any person who cares about peace. This is a wake up call for the UN to swing into action in full force and stop North Korea's obsession with nuclear bombs. The UN should not wait until small ripples turn into huge waves before thinking of how to get to the shore. Josephat Ombuna, Nairobi, Kenya @Jackalchachal thinks North Korea should be invited to talks: North Korea needs to be accountable for its actions like any country. It's time for the world to have some serious dialogue with them. If you want to have nuclear weapons then you need to be trusted and must abide the rules. This would be the first big step to resolve this issue. Let's invite Kim Jong-un to the United Nations in New York and get down to business. Chris, Northfield, Vermont USA @SouljaTroy1996 has a simple solution: In my opinion sanctions are the way to go, if at all possible.  Unfortunately this may cause more hardship on the people of the North. War is out of the question - we are fighting enough wars in the Middle East.  I have thought deeply about this question for a while now (still am) , with China being an ally this would also be a concern for NATO.  Kim Jong-un is a loose cannon and unpredictable and that makes him a threat. Robert Anderson, Dundee, Scotland UK I think we need to be prepared for any possible threat of them using weapons such as these. However, I don't think we should charge in and force North Korea to stop producing nuclear weapons. That is of course assuming they have been successful in making them. If we or any other countries for that matter become aggressive to them, the retaliation could be much worse. It's best to prepare for the worst but mainly ignore them. It's not like many of the countries condemning North Korea's actions have any moral high ground when they themselves are sat upon a huge stockpile of nuclear weapons. It's like a child in a playground showing off their strength, if they are not challenged they won't have the opportunity to show their force in a fight. Mark, Kingswinford, West Midlands, England UK The former NBA basketball player, Dennis Rodman who has had a number of well publicised meetings with North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un is cited by @ZZR600E3 as someone who could help: Compiled by Andree Massiah	North Korea's state television has announced the country has tested a hydrogen bomb.
Sayes Court will double in size and provide an additional 210 places by September 2015. Surrey County Council said it needs to "bridge a Â£215m funding gap" for 13,000 places, blaming an "unprecedented demand" on its services. It said nearby Esher School is also being completely rebuilt to boost capacity by 210 places.	An artist's impression of how an expanded primary school in Addlestone will look has been unveiled.
Kelly Mahon, of John Broad Avenue, Arleston, was arrested after the infant was reported missing from his home on 24 February. He was found safe and well the same day. Mahon, 41, admitted one charge of kidnap at Shrewsbury Crown Court and was remanded in custody. Judge Robin Onions told the defendant she was likely to receive a custodial sentence "of some length". During a hearing at Telford Magistrates' Court last month the prosecutor told the court the kidnap had been "pre-planned". Kelly Crowe told magistrates on 26 February: "When officers go around there (to Mahon's home) a number of baby items were present; cots, clothes, baby clothes, both female and male and also a to-do list. "She made reference to sterilisers, nappies, and milk for babies." The case has been adjourned until 12 May.	A woman has admitted kidnapping a nine-week-old baby boy in Telford.
The Scottish Salmon Company (SSC) said it was hit by "exceptional mortalities" amounting to 1,300 tonnes - about a fifth of its potential harvest. SSC also said "biological challenges", such as sea lice, had led to a lower mean weight of fish harvested. As a result, operating costs increased and earnings dipped, it added. The Oslo-listed company reported losses of Â£1.4m in the quarter before interest and tax. This was despite a 39% increase year-on-year in revenue as a result of increased harvested volumes and higher market prices. Revenue stood at Â£25.5m, while volumes rose from 5,130 tonnes to 5,486 tonnes. SSC managing director Craig Anderson said: "This quarter has been challenging and, like many other operators in the sector, results have been impacted by biological issues. "We have been working for some time to develop effective long term solutions to tackle these industry wide issues, such as the use of cleaner fish to combat sea lice. "In the shorter term, we are using a range of established best practice methods to manage the situation. "We remain focused on growing our business and developing our export markets to enable us to capitalise on the continued demand for premium Scottish salmon. "Maragay Mor, our new site in the Hebrides, has been commissioned and is an important element in delivering our strategy of long term sustainable growth."	A Scottish salmon producer has reported third-quarter losses after suffering an "unprecedented" level of deaths at its fish farms.
Oxfordshire County Council said two independent studies found having one organisation to run all services could save £100m over five years. But the plan is opposed by the county's five district councils, who have argued in favour of three councils instead. All the authorities have been criticised for engaging in a "turf war" over their rival devolution plans. County council leader Ian Hudspeth said public money should be spent on providing services, rather than running "six separate organisations". The district councils have argued the county needs an elected mayor, rather than fewer councillors, to get more money from Whitehall. Oxford City Council leader Bob Price said the county's plan was "the wrong proposal at the wrong time". He added: "For the people of Oxford, a unitary council would be a disaster. "The needs of a multi-ethnic and socially mixed urban community are very different to the more rural parts of the county." Leader of West Oxfordshire District Council James Mills said the aim of the district councils' devolution bid was to get more money from central government. He said: "A mayor gives a strong voice to Oxford, single point of contact to government and is accountable to the people of Oxfordshire." But Mr Hudspeth said the proposal was needed because the county council "cannot continue to make savings without further cuts to local services". He said: "One council for Oxfordshire would be more efficient and simpler for residents, with one phone number, one website and one point of contact." Residents are being asked for their views before the final proposal is considered by the county council's cabinet on 14 March.	A proposal to abolish six councils and create one county-wide local authority for Oxfordshire has been published.
Fears have been expressed by some in the industry that a breakdown in the current agreement could result in more cash machines charging a fee. LINK - which operates the network of 70,000 ATMs in the UK - said that its commercial model is "under review". Some banks are thought to be unhappy about the fees they currently pay. As a result all 38 members of the LINK network are due to have a series of meetings to try to reach an agreement, beginning next week. At the moment around 75% of ATMs are free to use. But Peter McNamara, the Chief Executive of Note Machine, a member of LINK, said that consumers could face being charged at many more of them. "If the proposals that are being put forward by LINK went ahead, we estimate that you could be losing up to a quarter of the free-to-use ATM sites in the UK," he told BBC Radio Five Live. At the centre of the dispute are the so-called interchange fees. When a customer of one bank uses a cash machine belonging to another bank, the customer's own bank pays a fee to the operator, in the region of 25p. It's thought that banks with a large number of card-holders feel they are being unfairly penalised. "Some of the very big banks have a lot of cardholders who do a lot of transactions, and they feel that perhaps their share of what they are putting in the pot that pays for ATMs is disproportionate and potentially too high," said Mr McNamara. "They may go outside the LINK mechanism to find a cheaper way of making those machines run, which is the risk in the system that could develop." LINK said the discussions could take several months. "We operate in a competitive market and there are other ATM networks in the UK available for card issuers and ATM operators if our model becomes unattractive," a spokesperson said. "We are working hard to avoid this situation."	The operator of the UK's ATM network has said it is working hard to keep cash withdrawals free for millions of bank customers.
The offers to protect religious sites have come from Muslims who include military servicemen, lawyers and Emmy Award-winning TV broadcasters. The JCC Association of North America, a network of cultural centres, reported more than 100 bomb threats against Jewish centres in the first two months of 2017. On Monday alone, the organisation said another 31 threats were made against Jewish centres including a gunshot fired through a Hebrew school window at an Indiana synagogue. In a tweet, a former Muslim marine, Tayyib Rashid, pledged: "If your synagogue or Jewish cemetery needs someone to stand guard, count me in. Islam requires it." Mr Rashid, known by his Twitter handle @MuslimMarine adds in his Periscope video that "I've seen a tremendous outpouring of love and support from all Americans, from Muslims, from my fellow Jewish Americans, from Christians, from atheists, from everyone". The former Marine welcomes people to meet him in a local coffee shop in his home town in Grayslake, Chicago, in his "initiative to help promote peace between Muslims and non-Muslims". He aims to open dialogue about "the recent atrocities committed by some hateful people" that were responsible for the "destruction and desecration of the graves of people of Jewish faith". He adds: "I condemn that wholeheartedly and I stand in solidarity with all my Jewish citizens." His now-viral tweet that has been "liked" by 12,000 supporters prompted an overwhelming number of responses from Jewish Twitter users with one inviting him over for Seder,, a ceremonial dinner held on the first two nights of Passover. Other Muslims, including Emmy Award-winning TV Broadcaster Momin Bhatti took to social media to pledge their support in his call to protect Jewish sites. This latest show of solidarity comes shortly after an online Muslim-led crowdfunding campaign to help repair a vandalised Jewish cemetery raised more than $150,000 (Â£122,000). On 20 February, more than 170 headstones were damaged at the Jewish cemetery just outside St. Louis, Missouri. In the same week, 100 headstones were overturned and broken at a Jewish cemetery in Philadelphia. Unity between Muslim and Jewish organisations was also displayed after an online campaign to raise funds for an arson damaged mosque in Florida raised more than $70,000 (Â£57,000). Adeel Karim, a member of the Islamic Society of New Tampa, posted on his Facebook profile that he was "floored" after realising that many of the donors to the campaign were Jewish. "I couldn't understand why people were donating in what seemed like weird amounts to the cause. There are sums of 18, 36, 72 dollars etc. then I figured out after clicking on the names Avi, Cohen, Goldstein, Rubin, Fisherâ€¦. "Jews donate in multiples of 18 as a form of what is called 'Chai'. It wishes the recipient long life. " President Trump opened his first speech to a joint session of Congress on 21 February by condemning the recent bomb threats and desecration of cemeteries. "Recent threats targeting Jewish community centres and vandalism of Jewish cemeteries, as well as last week's shooting in Kansas City, remind us that while we may be a nation divided on policies, we are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all its forms." Written by Wais Bashir, UGC & Social News team	Following the recent spate of bomb threats against Jewish community centres and the desecration of graves at cemeteries in Philadelphia and St. Louis, some Muslims have turned to social media to offer to guard Jewish sites.
In only his second season with Porsche, Webber and his two team-mates, German Timo Bernhard and New Zealander Brendon Hartley, need a fourth-place finish or better in the 6 Hours of Bahrain on Saturday to complete a remarkable run of success for car number 17. Winners of the last four races, they were runners-up at the previous event in June and took third at Spa in the race before that in May. Webber, 39, cannot remember such a hot streak of form beyond his days in junior categories and admits he never expected to be in contention so quickly at this stage of his return to sportscars. "I'm very surprised we're in this position," he said. "We had a few tough races at the start of the championship and now here we are in Bahrain ready to close the championship off hopefully. "It started in an incredible June where we got two cars home at Le Mans and had a 1-2 against Audi. "Since then we have won every race and I don't think we envisaged that - the aggressive mentality of the F1 approach." Not surprisingly, after his 12 years at the highest level of single-seater, open-wheel competition, Webber draws heavily on his experience of fighting against the likes of Lewis Hamilton, Sebastian Vettel and Fernando Alonso, the other contenders for the 2010 title at the final race of that season in Abu Dhabi. He learnt the hard way on that occasion, finishing eighth behind his three rivals and third overall in the championship. This time he aims to make amends. "Being a professional for so long, you have the ability to deal with the emotions and really pull it right back and just keep the basics in order, and that's what we've got to try to do," said Webber. "Having the scenarios played out if we've got things we need to deal with - are we rehearsed, are we practised, are we ready to go? "We don't want any what ifs, any 'woulda, coulda, shoulda' at 10pm on Saturday night." Media playback is not supported on this device Webber's challenge in 2010 was complicated by his acrimonious relationship with Red Bull team-mate Vettel. The German profited most from the Australian's problems with backmarkers under the lights at Yas Marina by winning the race and the championship. The team dynamic within the three-man Porsche 919 Hybrid line-up is noticeably more harmonious. "You have to be super, super open with each other in terms of communication, in terms of getting the best out of each other, the little strengths and weaknesses of each other in terms of corners you like, what type of tracks you like, what type of conditions do you like and even how the car develops," he revealed. "We've got a young bright-eyed and bushytailed youngster in Brendon Hartley, Timo Bernhard is super experienced in this category and then myself with a lot of experience. "We try to make the sure the car doesn't know who's in the car, which driver is in. The car has to be very benign, so we can use it." In his recent autobiography, Webber was critical of the way Red Bull allowed his partnership with Vettel to disintegrate following a series of incidents in 2010 and beyond. It's a marked contrast to his views on his current set-up where he believes his F1 experiences have contributed to Porsche's surge to the head of the field. "To put together this campaign with a great bunch of guys, I have felt pretty instrumental in it and I suppose that's as rewarding as other grand prix wins because I've had a bit more impact here in trying to help. "It's a big, big team and everyone's done a great job but it's been really nice to have been able to help behind the scenes and if we can put the icing on the cake it'll be a really, really nice feather in my cap." Webber and his team-mates lead the Audi trio of Switzerland's Marcel Fassler, Germany's Andre Lotterer and France's Benoit Treluyer by 13 points. They extended their advantage by an extra point on Friday after Bernhard and Hartley secured their fifth pole position of the season at the Sakhir track. The circuit where the wind blows off the desert and makes tyre performance even more critical is not one of Webber's favourites. Last year's third place with Porsche was his best in 11 races here. "We're in good shape, very confident we can have my best result here ever and then if that's enough - and that will be enough if I'm on the podium steps - then it'll a very, very long night on Saturday." And if he does become world champion for the first time in his 21 years in motorsport, will it rank as his finest achievement? "It would certainly be right up there, mate. It's not easy to win a grand prix and it's not easy to do what we've done here. "My biggest, biggest achievement to put together this championship with the other guys…?" His pause before delivering a classic Webber line says it all. "We'll certainly give it a good shake, yeah." After the anti-climax in one Middle Eastern kingdom on 14 November 2010, Webber has atonement in his sights on 21 November 2015 in another.	Almost exactly five years after Mark Webber lost his best chance of becoming Formula 1 world champion, the Australian is on the brink of fulfilling his title dream in the World Endurance Championship this weekend in Bahrain.
Female players had been considering striking in an effort to address wage discrimination. The US Soccer Federation sued the players' union to prevent a strike that could have caused the team to miss the summer Olympics. The judge ruled the players are not eligible to strike because of a provision in an earlier contract. In March, five players filed a lawsuit with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission alleging pay discrimination. They argued female players were sometimes paid four times less than their male counterparts despite holding the world title. The players' union had not called a strike over the issue, but had been weighing the possibility. The US Soccer Federation - the sport's national governing body- filed its own suit to prevent a strike. It argued a no-strike clause from an early collective bargaining agreement carried over to the 2013  memorandum of understanding that the players are currently working under. The union argued that a no-strike clause had never been specifically laid out in the terms of the latest agreement. However, the judge sided with the federation citing oral and email communication between the two sides, as evidence that the original terms were passed to the new agreement. "A collective bargaining agreement may be partly or wholly oral and a written collective bargaining agreement may be orally modified," Judge Sharon Johnson Coleman wrote in her ruling. The team is expected to perform well at the Olympic Games in Rio and the federation said it feared a strike would damage the development of football in US. The players, many of whom have expressed outrage at gender pay differences, will continue their wage discrimination case.	A judge has ruled that the world champion US women's football team does not have the right to strike.
Tour de France winner Wiggins became the most decorated Olympian in British history, with a total of seven medals. He won the cycling time trial after Glover and Stanning rowed to victory in the women's pairs; all three were hailed by PM David Cameron. GB's Michael Jamieson later took the silver in the men's 200m breaststroke. Team GB kept the nation waiting until day five of the Games for the first home gold medals; however, there are high hopes for further podium finishes in Thursday's cycling. After his victory, Wiggins, 32, cycled through cheering crowds gathered at Hampton Court, where he hugged his wife Catherine and his children Ben and Isabella. Speaking at a press conference on Wednesday evening, Wiggins said that despite his success, he did not consider himself to be Britain's greatest ever Olympian. He also said that, fresh from his victory in the Tour de France, he had been "greedy" and also intended to win Olympic gold. "I felt I could do both," he said, adding that the crowd support on his Olympic time trial ride was "incredible". David Cameron described the successes in rowing and cycling as a "golden moment for Britain". Mr Cameron said: "I think it's already a great Olympics, already a great start but this is really going to put rocket boosters on it for the whole country. I'm very, very excited." Meanwhile, a BBC investigation has found illegal websites still offering tickets - which they have no right to sell - and which buyers may never receive. Police have warned that such sites do not have access to tickets. Det Supt Nick Downing, the head of the Olympic crime squad, said: "If they're an authorised site selling tickets, you've got to ask the question - where did they get their tickets from? How can they guarantee a supply? They can't." In other developments: Briton Chris Froome took the bronze medal in the time trial, which was watched along the route by an estimated 300,000 people. Wiggins's grandmother Maureen Cousins was also at the side of the road as he crossed the finish line. "I screamed when he won.  It is a combination of delight and relief... We all think he is the greatest," she said. Earlier, Glover and Stanning made history by becoming the first British women to win an Olympic gold medal for rowing. Mr Johnson said an "historic triumph will be celebrated throughout the country today". "It's an outstanding achievement and I'm sure it will spur on all our athletes in the medal stakes. It's fantastic - Go Team GB," he added. Glover, 26, a former PE teacher from Penzance, Cornwall, had been rowing for only four years before securing gold with Stanning, 27, a Royal Artillery captain, from Lossiemouth, Moray. They stormed home in front of cheering crowds at Eton Dorney after leading from the start of the women's pair race. After crossing the line they hugged each other and saluted the crowd, which included Princes William and Harry and the Princess Royal. Speaking at the finish line, Glover's mother Rachel said her family was "absolutely delighted". Stanning is likely to be deployed to Afghanistan next year. Her commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Craig Palmer, said: "Soldiers from 32nd Regiment Royal Artillery were thrilled to watch the race from their bases in Afghanistan, while their friends and families watched it here in the UK. "I am sure that they have been inspired by her performance and we look forward to welcoming her back to the regiment later this year." Lt Col Palmer spoke to Stanning on the BBC News Channel, telling her she had "done a very special thing". "We're looking forward to a very big party when you do come back to the regiment," he told Stanning. Labour leader Ed Miliband praised the athletes as "fantastic" and said the games were going "beyond" expectations.	Praise has poured in for cyclist Bradley Wiggins and rowers Helen Glover and Heather Stanning after they scooped Britain's first gold medals of 2012.
The mural, called Slave Labour, disappeared from a wall in Wood Green, north London, in February and appeared in a Miami sale. But it was removed from the lot after protests by Haringey Council. It is now up for auction in June in Covent Garden by the Sincura Group. A local councillor and the local Trades Union Congress have attacked the sale. The mural, which depicts a boy hunched over a sewing machine making Union Jack bunting, appeared on the side of a Poundland store last May, just before the Diamond Jubilee celebrations. A spokesman for the auctioneers Sincura said the mural "has been sensitively restored under a cloak of secrecy", and will go on show alongside pieces by Damien Hirst, Andy Warhol, Mario Testino and Russell Young. But Wood Green councillor Alan Strickland said: "This is a piece of art given to the community for public enjoyment, and people will find it galling that you can only view this work at an expensive champagne reception, when it belongs with the people of north London, not a private owner. "We saw the level of public anger last time, as the story went around the world, and I expect the same this time." And Keith Flett, secretary of the Haringey Trades Union Congress, said: "The Slave Labour Banksy belongs to the people of Haringey not to a wealthy private client." When the mural was up for auction in Miami, it was expected to fetch up to Â£450,000. There was suspicion it had been stolen when it disappeared but the Metropolitan Police said there were "no reports of any theft". Slave Labour will go on sale at the London Film Museum on 2 June.	A Banksy artwork which had been withdrawn from an auction in the US has been put up for sale again.
A monthly travelcard costs £135 ($174), according to a Deutsche Bank report - £33 ($43) more than Dublin, which was ranked second priciest city. Auckland, where a ticket costs £95 ($123), came third, while New York City, at £91 ($118), came fourth, and Tokyo fifth at £86 ($111). Transport for London (TfL) said the findings did "not show the true cost of transport in other countries". The survey also found the cost of travel in the capital dropped since 2014, when commuters paid £165 ($213). Source: Deutsche Bank Its authors ranked London tenth most expensive for petrol, and the third for car hire. Hong Kong had the priciest petrol, while Amsterdam was the most expensive for a daily car rental, the report said. London's taxis fared slightly better, ranked 20th in a list of 47 cities, with Zurich topping the list for the most expensive fares. For quality of life, London was ranked 33rd in the world, similar to other "mega cities" such as Tokyo, Paris and New York. According to the report, these cities "rank very low" for quality of life, mostly due to "high living costs, crime, pollution and commuting time". "This is highly subjective and one person's long commute may be another person's chance to catch up on Netflix," the report said. "Megacity dwellers may also forsake short-term quality of life for aspirational reasons," the report added. Wellington, in New Zealand, was ranked as the best city to live in in terms of quality of life, followed by Edinburgh, Vienna. Melbourne and Zurich. In February, TfL revealed its fares income was down £90m last year. TfL is currently planning to cut £16bn from its budget by 2020/21 as it  aims to become self sufficient with its operating costs. The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has frozen fares on buses and trams until 2020, but travelcard prices are set by train operating companies and so are not under full TfL control. A TfL spokesman said: "London also has one of the most extensive set of travel concessions in the world with free or discounted travel for children, the over-60s, students and veterans."	Public transport in London is the world's most expensive, a report says.
Media playback is not supported on this device The Alan King-trained seven-year-old, a 16-1 shot, led all the way for the 19-time Champion jockey, who is retiring this season. Ma Filleule (5-1) was second with 5-2 favourite Don Cossack third. McCoy said: "I would love to say it's a relief, but I actually got such a thrill riding him." The Northern Irishman did not seem to fancy his chances much pre-race, but trainer King's seven-year-old put in some spectacular leaps on the way round. "I was actually thinking I wouldn't mind riding the horse in next year's Champion Chase," said McCoy after his victory. "He ran away with me for a mile and a half and I thought he would never keep it up but I was quite happy coming down the hill." McCoy's wife Chanelle and several of his family members were waiting in the winner's enclosure to greet him after his victory. "He wanted that feeling one more time," said Chanelle. "Heading into day three he wanted one more time to ride a winner at Cheltenham, to soak up the atmosphere and not finish his career without one more winner."	AP McCoy won his first race of his final Cheltenham Festival on day three, riding Uxizandre to victory in the Ryanair Chase.
The US-born radical Yemeni cleric Anwar al-Awlaki is head of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. Two brothers believed to be mid-ranking al-Qaeda officials died in a drone strike in south Yemen on Thursday, Yemeni officials said. The attack came just days after al-Qaeda chief Osama Bin Laden was killed in Pakistan by US Navy Seals. The Pentagon refused to comment on the reports that Anwar al-Awlaki was specifically targeted in Yemen. According to Yemen's defence ministry, the missile fired by the drone hit a car in in the province of Shabwa carrying two brothers, identified by Yemeni officials as Musa'id and Abdullah Mubarak. But reports from Washington now suggest US commanders had believed they had one of al-Qaeda's most valuable targets in their sights. "We were hoping it was him," one unnamed US official told CBS News. The reported attempt to kill Mr Awlaki is believed to be the first known US military strike within Yemen since May 2010, when missiles mistakenly killed one of Mr Saleh's envoys. In September the country's foreign minister said that such unmanned strikes had been suspended. The report comes as Yemenis continue to take to the streets to demand that Ali Abdullah Saleh, president for 30 years, step down. According to the Wall Street Journal, there were several attempts to target Mr Awlaki on Thursday. He escaped an initial attack of three rockets fired at a vehicle in which he was travelling and then swapped cars with the two brothers, who were killed in a second strike by a single drone, the newspaper said. Washington considers the Yemen-based al-Qaeda branch the world's most active terror cell. It is estimated to have some 300 fighters within Yemeni strongholds, clustered around mountain ranges where the central government has little reach. The group is said to have inspired attacks by Muslims within the US as well as plots to smuggle explosives on planes heading to the US. Some analysts are convinced that, after the death of Bin Laden, Mr Awlaki represents the greatest threat. An American-born cleric of Yemeni descent, he was placed on a terrorism blacklist in July 2010 and had imposed financial sanctions on him. US officials say Mr Awlaki helped recruit Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the Nigerian accused of attempting to blow up an airliner as it flew into Detroit on 25 December 2009. Maj Nidal Hasan, the US Army psychiatrist accused of killing 13 comrades in the Fort Hood shooting in 2009, sought religious advice from Mr Awlaki and saw him preach in the US state of Virginia in 2001, US officials say. A student found guilty of attempting to murder British MP Stephen Timms in London was also said to have been inspired by Mr Awlaki's online sermons.	A US drone attack in Yemen targeted but failed to kill one of al-Qaeda's most influential figures, US reports say.
However, that's at the heart of the media's frustration. The fact is the campaign has become a succession of tightly controlled photo opportunities... by all the main parties. This has become the hi-vis, hard hat election. It's been the predictable campaign gear for both David Cameron and George Osborne. No walkabouts. No risk of a verbal ambush by ordinary voters. But there's a fascinating side to this election where the campaign can offer raw politics, unplugged... where the voters engage with the politicians seeking their support. Election hustings have been one of the big successes of this general election. Magazine Monitor: Where did the word 'hustings' come from? There have been a record number of them held in churches, according to research by one Christian charity. I've been to a number of hustings so far and there's one reason why they work. The debates and exchanges are close up and often personal. Voters are able to question the politicians and get beyond some of the campaign sound bites and slogans. They also often highlight issues that are just overlooked in the "noise" of national campaigning. That was the case at a hustings at the All Nations for Christ church in the Normanton area of the Derby South constituency, where the audience were mostly from the city's African Caribbean communities. On the platform, representatives from all the parties, including Dame Margaret Beckett, who's defending a 6,000 Labour majority in Derby South. There were questions from the audience on immigration, Europe and schools. But one question particularly gripped the audience: Why were graduates from the African Caribbean communities three times more likely to be out of a job, six months after leaving university? The study was carried out by the Bow Group think-tank and Elevation Networks, a youth employment charity, and was based on interviews with 2,500 students over two years. It also found that black students were not being given the same opportunities as white students. One angry voice in the audience shouted: "That's outrageous and disgraceful". It got backing from the Greens. "That indicates there's some form of discrimination going on in the jobs market," said John Devine, the Green Party candidate for Derbyshire's Amber Valley. There was a suggestion from one questioner for employers to be forced by law to audit who and where they recruit staff. A precise solution perhaps required a precise response. But the Conservatives' Derby South candidate Evonne Williams tiptoed round this one. "It's something that we haven't considered but I'm happy to take it back to the party," she told the questioner. And Labour's Dame Margaret? "We're going to be looking at the Equalities Act to see if it needs modernising and updating. So your suggestion is exactly the kind of idea we will be looking at," she said. One platform speaker wanted to go much further. Lucy Care, the Lib Dem's candidate for Derby North, suggested that all job application forms should no longer include the person's name. "We would like to have name blank application forms," she said. "So all you read is their experience and what they've done. Often the name of the applicant can deter some employers from short listing or recruiting." As for UKIP's Derby South hopeful Victor Webb, he didn't completely rule out having such a recruitment audit, but: "I wouldn't do this because of the burden of cost and regulation on small businesses." For this hustings audience, maybe no instant solutions but they got the politicians thinking about their concerns. "The key is getting people engaged," said Marc Grant, the event organiser. "It's the first time we've held a hustings at the church." "We wanted to show why politics is so important to our daily lives and I'm really pleased so many  people came along." Whatever the outcome of this election, the locally organised hustings have emerged as a big campaign winner.	David Cameron has been telling reporters that this election campaign is not about photo opportunities but more about the UK's long term economic revival.

This huge housing project - now one of the most desirable addresses in Gaza - was built since 2012 with money from Qatar and named after the former ruler of the wealthy Gulf state. So far, more than 2,000 Palestinians - mostly low-income families - have moved in. The complex has a new school, shops, an impressive mosque and plenty of greenery. There is a constant whirr of construction noise as more buildings are erected. But as the regional crisis over Qatar escalates, Palestinians here - as elsewhere in the impoverished territory - fear the loss of their major donor and ally. "We're going to be the victims," says one resident, Baha Shalaby. "Everything's going to stop - the money, the support, the infrastructure, the building work." In recent years, Qatar has spent hundreds of millions of dollars on new homes, a hospital and main roads in the Gaza Strip. It has pledged about $1bn (Â£780m) more. It is not yet clear how its projects will be affected by the ongoing row with Saudi Arabia and other Gulf Arab countries. They are trying to economically isolate Qatar, accusing it of fostering terrorism - a charge the emirate strongly denies. However, the engineer in charge of fixing Gaza's main north-south road warns of the possible wider implications of any cuts. "We have hundreds of workers, all supporting families," says Hanafi Sadallah. "Levels of unemployment in Gaza are very high, so if the Qataris end our funding, they'll all just be left sitting at home." Just over 40% of Gazans are out of work, according to Palestinian officials - one of the highest unemployment rates in the world. One of Saudi Arabia's demands has been for Qatar to stop backing Hamas, which runs Gaza. The Islamist group took over by force a decade ago - ousting Palestinian Authority (PA) security forces, a year after Hamas won legislative elections. Hamas leaders insist that Qatari help to Gaza has been primarily charitable. "The houses that were built are not for Hamas, the streets that were asphalted are not for Hamas," one senior figure, Mahmoud Zahar, tells the BBC. "The humanitarian institutions - hospitals and schools, they're also for the Palestinian people.  All attempts to hitch Hamas to Qatar are wrong and void." Israel says Hamas has also used foreign funding to bolster its military infrastructure, which its blockade aims to keep from strengthening. To try to prevent any such accusations against its projects, Doha set up its own coordination office in Gaza and deals directly with contractors or works with UN agencies. Nevertheless, Qatar's initiatives have buoyed Hamas through difficult times - the tight border restrictions imposed by both Israel and Egypt, and three bloody conflicts with Israel. There has also been political and diplomatic support from Doha. The emir of Qatar is the only head of state to have visited the Palestinian territory since Hamas has been in charge. Many leaders of the group - including its former head, Khaled Meshaal, have been living in luxurious exile in Doha. Now as Hamas seeks to ease pressure on its patron, several have reportedly left at Qatar's request. Last month, the group also announced a new policy document in Doha, which tempered its long-held position against accepting an interim Palestinian state, and made no mention of its parent organisation, the Muslim Brotherhood. The Brotherhood has been categorised as a terrorist group by Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. The latest developments concerning Qatar come amid mounting political and economic strain on Hamas. US President Donald Trump has said that, alongside the so-called Islamic State, al-Qaeda, and Hezbollah, Hamas is contributing to a regional "humanitarian and security disaster". Last week, Israel agreed to a PA plan to cut power supplies to two million people in Gaza that will reduce their daily average of four hours of electricity by 45 minutes. Hamas accuses its political rivals of plotting with the Trump administration and Israel to unseat it in Gaza. Many of its members link local and wider regional developments. "Qatar is being punished for speaking freely and supporting the Arab Spring," remarks Hamas parliamentarian, Yahya Musa, at a small rally in Sheikh Hamad City. "It's being punished for supporting us and the resistance. We stand with our brothers to reject US plans against Qatar and the conspiracy against the resistance." As he speaks, children wave Palestinian and Qatari flags, alongside signs reading "Solidarity with Qatar" and "We are all Qatar". The Palestinians here are banking on a diplomatic solution to the crisis. Without one, they know they could end up paying the price.	In a playground in Sheikh Hamad City, children shriek with delight, while their parents chat in the cool shade of their peach-coloured flats.
Jean Say killed his son and daughter two years ago. The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said Southwark Sapphire unit in south London "encouraged" victims to withdraw allegations to boost detection rates. The Metropolitan Police said substantial changes had been made. The rape allegation against Say was dismissed by a detective sergeant based at Southwark, who said the circumstances did not constitute rape because the woman "consented". The report by the IPCC said: "There is no doubt from the evidence that the woman made an allegation of rape at Walworth police station which should have been believed and thoroughly investigated." The IPCC said the Southwark Sapphire squad's approach of "failing to believe victims" was "wholly inappropriate".  It also said it was "under-performing and over-stretched". Deputy chairwoman of the IPCC Deborah Glass said: "There's no doubt this was an incredibly serious, shocking incident. "We know with all the cases that we've dealt with that the consequences of not dealing with allegations of rape can be extremely serious. "This is yet another tragic illustration of that." Say, 62, a retired concierge, attacked his daughter Regina, eight, and son Rolls, 10, in their beds at his home in Southwark in 2011, while they were on a weekend access visit. The Old Bailey heard he killed them to spite his wife who had left him. He was given a 30-year minimum term. The case sparked a wider investigation into the work of the unit between July 2008 and September 2009, the results of which have now been published. The IPCC has carried out five previous inquiries into Southwark Sapphire command and it is the police watchdog's ninth investigation into the Met's response to victims of sexual violence. By Danny ShawHome affairs correspondent, BBC News No one will ever know if Jean Say's children would be alive today if he'd been arrested and investigated for rape three years before he stabbed them to death. But if police hadn't "no-crimed" the rape allegation, the chances are Say's threatening and violent behaviour would have been uncovered. The Say case is the most egregious example of the dysfunctional approach to rape investigations at the Southwark Sapphire unit; what we don't know is how many other sexual assault victims were wrongly disbelieved and the impact that's had on them and on others. Although Scotland Yard says the Sapphire units have changed for the better, the practice of no-crimeing is still a problem across other forces: in England and Wales reported rapes are three times as likely to be written off as other incidents are. Home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said three Metropolitan officers who had been facing possible dismissal over a previous bungled investigation into the serial sex offender Kirk Reid, were still with the force. Two of them, a superintendent and a detective inspector, have been promoted. A detective sergeant is facing disciplinary proceedings for alleged gross misconduct in connection with the allegations. In another case, Det Con Ryan Coleman-Farrow, who was based in Southwark, was jailed for 16 months in October last year for failing to investigate rape and sexual assault claims. A second officer, based in Islington, north London, is still under criminal investigation. In total 19 officers from across London have been disciplined, including three who have been sacked. A Met Police spokesman said: "We have for some time acknowledged that previous investigation of rape and serious sexual assault in the MPS was below standard. "The activities identified in this report came during that era and highlight specific issues within Southwark which resulted in unacceptable actions by local officers. "It is as a result of such failings that we have made substantial changes to the investigation of rape and serious sexual assault, both in terms of structure and revised working practices."	A police officer at a sex crime unit encouraged a woman to drop a rape claim against a man who went on to murder his two children, a report has said.
The Transocean Winner, which has diesel on board, was under tow west of Lewis when it was hit by severe storms. It became detached from the tug boat overnight, before running aground at the beach of Dalmore in the Carloway area. Stornoway Coastguard said there were no personnel on board the rig and there was no risk to life. However, coastguard personnel have blocked access to the beach for health and safety reasons. The Marine Accident Investigation Branch has begun an investigation into the incident. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) said it was monitoring for any pollution from the rig. The agency said Transocean Winner has 280 metric tonnes of diesel on board. Scotland's Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham said key agencies were doing what was necessary to "ensure the rig is secured and to minimise any immediate safety or environmental risks". A spokesman said: "Following the grounding of the semi-submersible drilling rig Transocean Winner on the Isle of Lewis, the Secretary of State's Representative (SOSREP) for Maritime Salvage and Intervention Hugh Shaw is now in discussions with the owners Transocean and the salvors. "The Maritime and Coastguard Agency's counter pollution branch and the SOSREP have both been monitoring the situation since yesterday evening and the local authority, police and Marine Scotland have all been kept informed." Salvage company Smit has been mobilised to deal with the incident, the MCA added. The Transocean Winner was being towed from Norway to Malta. BBC Alba reporter Angus Macdonald said the structure was "towering over the beach". He told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme: "The rig has more or less come ashore at the beach of Dalmore. "Dalmore is a well-known beauty spot. It is a sandy beach where a lot of surfers turn up because the waves are so good." Foster Evans, who visited the stretch of beach involved last week, sent BBC News Scotland online an image showing how the wide sweep of sand usually looks. Western Isles SNP MSP Alasdair Allan and MP Angus MacNeil said the incident underlined the need for Scotland to have two emergency tugs. An emergency towing vessel has been sent to the scene from the Northern Isles. Scotland used to have two of the boats available to the coastguard to cover the north and west coasts, before the UK government reduced the service to a single ship in 2012. Mr Allan said: "This morning the tow line between a tug and the Transocean Winner oil rig snapped in heavy weather, resulting in the rig going aground at Dalmore on the west side of Lewis. "I am grateful to hear that there have been no injuries reported after this incident but it does leave us with a significant environmental threat to deal with. "I am also deeply concerned to hear that the Maritime and Coastguard Agency's nearest emergency towing vessel was in the region of 14 hours away."	A 17,000-tonne drilling rig has run aground after being blown ashore on the Western Isles.
Education Secretary John Swinney launched the "intense" three month consultation last September. But the group which mounted a legal challenge against the scheme said there had been no updates from ministers. The government said it held more than 50 meetings during the consultation. A spokesman said Mr Swinney would update parliament in "due course". The named person policy, introduced as part of the Children and Young People Scotland Act of 2014, set out to appoint a single point of contact, such as a teacher or health visitor, to look out for the welfare of all children up to the age of 18. The consultation was announced six weeks after the UK Supreme Court ruled elements of the policy to be "incompatible" with the right to privacy and family life, as set out in the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) Feedback from it was due to be collated by the government, with Mr Swinney intending to outline his next steps before the end of 2016. But the No To Named Persons (NO2NP) group, which mounted the legal challenge, said they were not involved in the process. Freedom of information requests by the group for details of the consultation discussions were rejected. NO2NP spokesman Simon Calvert said: "The engagement period was really a sham consultation because Mr Swinney only wanted to deal with those who support the scheme and organisations mainly funded by the government. "He refused to engage with us even though we represent an important cross-section of Scottish society, huge numbers of parents and more than 35,000 people who signed our petition. "The three-month 'engagement' has long since ended. It looks like it could be more like six or seven months, March or April 2017, before we hear anything." He added: "The Supreme Court agreed with us that the intrusive sharing of private information which was at the heart of the Named Person scheme was unlawful. "The court granted our appeal, and ordered the Scottish government to pay all our costs. It was a total defeat for the Scottish government. "The substantial delay in announcing their plans to try to navigate a way around the ruling indicates that reality is finally beginning to bite." After the legal challenge, Mr Swinney was forced to act to halt the roll-out of the named person scheme, which has already been trialled in some parts of Scotland. It had been due to be introduced across the country on August 31 2016, but Mr Swinney said he hoped the named person policy can now come into force a year on from that. A Scottish government spokeswoman said: "The engagement involved more than 50 meetings with some 250 organisations and groups - and included around 700 young people, parents/carers, practitioners and professionals. "This included leaders from health, education, local authorities, police, faith communities, charities, unions and professional bodies. "The deputy first minister will update parliament in due course."	Campaigners opposed to the Scottish government's named person scheme claim ministers have refused to engage with them during a consultation on plans to reform the policy.
Maya Kantengule was found at the bottom of a swimming pool at Waveney River Centre holiday park in Burgh St Peter, Norfolk, on May 1 2016. She was declared dead later that day at James Paget University Hospital. South Norfolk Council environmental health officer Chris Coker said people swam at the centre at their own risk. Maya's father, Livial Kantengule, said in a written statement at the inquest in Norwich that he spoke to Jane Rainer, the mother of his daughter's best friend, as he arrived and decided not to wait at the pool during the party. He returned there with his wife, Glenda, after receiving a message there had been an accident. Maya had already been taken to the hospital near Great Yarmouth. Her parents were at her bedside when she was pronounced dead. Mr Kantengule said he did not ask if there was a lifeguard. "Jane used to volunteer to help with the swimming lessons, so we assumed Maya would be adequately supervised while in the pool," he said. Maya, from Smith's Walk, Oulton Broad, near Lowestoft, Suffolk, attended Dell Primary School. Jaqueline Bell, a teaching assistant at the school, said in a written statement that Maya started weekly swimming lessons in reception year. "She was nervous in the water and would use armbands and a woggle," she said. Mr Coker told the inquest the indoor pool at Waveney River Centre could be privately hired. He said it was 1.5m (5ft) at its deepest and signs were up stating there were no lifeguards on duty and that people swam at their own risk. The inquest, expected to last two days, continues.	A seven-year-old girl drowned at her best friend's birthday pool party while there was no lifeguard on duty, an inquest heard.
Uber CEO Travis Kalanick made the admission while speaking at a private event in Vancouver, according to Canadian tech news site Betakit. The $1bn figure was later confirmed with Uber China by Reuters news agency. US-based Uber launched in China in 2014 and competes against the country's largest taxi app Didi Kuaidi. Uber is available in more than 40 cities in China. It announced last year that it would expand into 100 Chinese cities over the next 12 months. "We're profitable in the USA, but we're losing over $1bn a year in China," Betakit quoted Mr Kalanick as saying. He described China as the firm's largest international marketplace. But Uber's market share is dwarfed by that of the larger Didi Kuaidi. "We have a fierce competitor that's unprofitable in every city they exist in, but they're buying up market share." Mr Kalanick has previously said the firm had gone from a tiny 1% share of China's market at the beginning of 2015 to about 30% to 35%. Didi Kuaidi, which is backed by Chinese tech giants Tencent and Alibaba, has now also partnered with Uber's rival US ride-sharing service Lyft. Mr Kalanick said he had recently raised about $200m to help the firm compete in emerging markets, Betakit said. "I wish the world wasn't that way. I prefer building rather than fundraising. But if I don't participate in the fundraising bonanza, I'll get squeezed out by others buying market share," he added. Uber is available in 380 cities around the world, according to the website.	App-based car-hire service Uber is losing more than $1bn (Â£699m) a year in China, as it struggles against what it called a "fierce competitor".
Both sides remain in qualifying places with Essex top on run-rate and Glamorgan in third. Essex make one change with Jamie Porter replacing Matt Quinn in their seam attack., while Glamorgan are unchanged. Glamorgan won the toss and captain Jacques Rudolph chose to bat first on a cloudy afternoon. Both teams face a hectic schedule of five limited-overs games in a week, as the One-Day Cup and T20 Blast groups both reach their climax. Essex lost to Surrey by 66 runs despite 131 from Jesse Ryder, while Glamorgan went down by 33 runs away to Somerset,  in their previous matches. "Though we're still in the top four, a win (over Somerset) would have set us on the way to a quarter-final- we want to win every game" Glamorgan fast bowler Michael Hogan told BBC Wales. Essex coach Chris Silverwood told the club's website "The players know they have to bring consistency to their game,  if we are to ensure Essex are in the quarter-finals of both white-ball competitions, and we need to start with a win against Glamorgan." Glamorgan won the 2015 match in Cardiff by 146 runs, with Colin Ingram hitting 130. Essex : Browne, Westley, Ryder, Bopara (c), Lawrence, ten Doeschate, Foster, Zaidi, Napier, Masters, Porter. Glamorgan: Lloyd, Rudolph (c), Bragg, Ingram, Donald, Wallace, Wagg, Meschede, Salter, van der Gugten, Hogan.	Essex and Glamorgan will be looking to recover from defeats as they meet at Chelmsford in the One-Day Cup.
Union leaders are hoping the formation of a first so-called Dairy Producer Organisation (DPO) could help put the industry on a stronger footing. It would involve small family farms across Wales linking up to talk with milk processors as one legal entity. The hope is that streamlining the way farmers deal with creameries could attract more of them to Wales. But a report has warned that persuading farmers to join up could be a challenge, and there would be no guarantee that processors would agree to strike a deal with them. The main purpose of a DPO is to negotiate terms and conditions of supply, including price, with one or more milk processors. As such, they are exempted from some aspects of competition law. There is currently one DPO in operation in England, and one in Scotland - but they are commonplace throughout Europe, especially in Germany. A working group, involving figures from both farming unions, is investigating what role DPOs could play in securing the industry's future in Wales. Aled Jones, chairman of NFU Cymru's dairy board told BBC Wales that "farmers coming together" could lead to "a far more professional means of operating". "At the moment we deal on an individual basis with the processor but I think long term we are far stronger if we speak with one voice and have that cooperation and attitude of mind." Recent years have seen farmers protesting outside creameries over milk prices but Mr Jones said the focus should now be on "building better relationships". "Nearly half of Welsh milk is carted out of Wales to be processed and that puts us in a weak position.  We saw that last year when there was an oversupply of milk and farmers in West Wales were in danger of not having a buyer for their milk." "Looking forward we must try and attract new investment or increased processing in Wales.  And obviously, to do that you need to work in a professional manner." Mr Jones, who farms in Caernarfon, Gwynedd, explained that the idea offers security and added value to both producers and processors, but that setting one up could take years. A report commissioned on behalf of the working group warned that persuading farmers to take part could be far from easy. Plan needed for rural economy - Labour AM Farming collaborations have a relatively poor track record in Britain and many producers would be wary of getting their fingers burnt, said report authors Promar International. However the consultants concluded that farmers in Wales should seriously consider DPOs or live with "the insanity of accepting the status quo". UK government ministers have indicated that they see a role for them - so farming leaders claim the concept - a product of EU law - will be unaffected by Brexit. The position of many dairy producers in Wales is fragile after a tumultuous few years, during which the price of milk fell sharply. At one point in 2016 it was below 20p per litre at farm gate prices - the average price paid to all producers for milk sold to dairies. Figures show the number of dairy farms here has nearly halved during the last 15 years, with an average of three farmers a month leaving the industry. Farming leaders say that though the price of milk has recovered somewhat in recent months, many producers are still struggling and are now shouldering heavy debts. A new three part series, starting on BBC One Wales on Monday, takes an in-depth look at the industry's problems. Gareth Wyn Jones - Milk Man is on at 20:30 GMT, BBC One Wales on Monday 6 February 2017 and later on BBC iPlayer.	Dairy farmers in Wales have been urged to club together to help negotiate a better price for their milk.
Accountancy group UHY Hacker Young claimed new "boutique" distillers were pushing big brands off the shelf. It said Scotland saw a 50% rise in new distilleries over the past year, from 12 in 2015 to 18 in 2016. In England, a record 35 new distilleries were opened last year compared with 28 the previous year. James Simmonds, of UHY Hacker Young, said: "Both the craft spirits and the craft brewery sectors are going through a period of explosive creativity. "You can see that in everything from the logos, branding and advertising of these products. "The quality of the product is streets ahead of their big brand competitors. "It is no wonder that the global drinks giants are worried, and the best way they have found to deal with that new competition is get out chequebooks and buy them."	An "explosive creativity" of craft spirits has seen 50 new distilleries open across the UK last year, according to a study.
Officers are searching in Weston Park East in Bath, where the first foot was found by dog walkers in February. A second foot was found in a garden of a property in Weston Park in July, and another was found in a garden in nearby Cranwells Park two weeks ago. Police said they do not believe a crime has been committed and it is likely they were all medical exhibits. Det Insp Paul Catton, of Avon and Somerset Police, said he "strongly believed" the finds had originated from "an old private collection". A spokesman said the new search was being carried out "to try to find anything which may be connected to the discoveries". "All three feet show signs they have come into contact with animals and it is likely that they have been moved to the locations they were found from a specific source," Det Insp Catton added. "Regulations are significantly stricter these days compared to several decades ago and we believe the source is most probably someone who used the feet as a teaching aid. "It is also possible these feet may have been found by someone who has then innocently buried them in an attempt to dispose of them and they have then been unearthed by animals, or that animals have disturbed the location they were stored." Tests on the first foot showed it was human but found very little DNA, and preliminary results from on the second foot were similar. The third foot, found on 5 August, is still undergoing tests. Mr Catton said officers were searching the whole of the park and the grounds of a nearby school. "The school is in a central location to the sites where all three feet have been found and the last thing we want is for a member of the public to come across one of these unpleasant finds. "We believe someone knows something about where these feet have come from and would appeal for them to get in touch," he added.	Police are searching a park in an area where three severed human feet have been found this year.
Two men have already been arrested and questioned on suspicion of theft and fraud offences. A man in his 30s is still being detained in Wexford. Another man arrested in Limerick on Monday has been released without charge. Brexit Secretary David Davis said on Tuesday the news that one of the London attackers - Rachid Redouane - moved there from Dublin should not alter existing travel arrangements between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. The two men were arrested by Garda detectives and questioned about the use of documentation and Irish social security numbers in Redouane's name, Irish broadcaster RTÉ reported. An Garda Síochána (Irish police) detectives are working to identify the activities, addresses and associates of Rachid Redouane during his time in Ireland. However, Gardaí have stressed their investigation is focused on theft and fraud offences rather than terror. The investigation into Redouane's time in Ireland has intensified over the past 48 hours. Thirty-year-old Redouane, who claimed to be Moroccan-Libyan, was based in the the east London suburb of Barking. He was also known by the name Rachid Elkhdar. Details of his identity and background began to emerge when an Irish identity card was found on his body after he was shot dead by police. It is understood he arrived in the UK in 2006 and applied for asylum but that the application was rejected in 2009. It is reported that he lived in Harrow in north-west London. The details of when he arrived in the Republic of Ireland or how long he stayed there are still not clear. However, it is believed he obtained a European Union residence permit which allowed him to travel to the UK whilst he lived in Ireland. He married a British woman, 38-year-old Charisse Ann O'Leary, in Dublin in 2012. It is understood that it was this marriage that allowed Redouane to obtain a 4 EU FAM card given to spouses of European Union citizens. The couple lived in Rathmines on Dublin's south-side. Reports suggest Redouane worked as a pastry chef. He left Ireland after the marriage and settled in the UK before returning to Ireland in 2015. Redouane is understood to have had a 17-month-old daughter with Ms O'Leary, although the couple were estranged. According to reports, he visited his child before carrying out the London attack along with Khuram Shazad Butt and Youssef Zaghba. An imam who runs a mosque in Galway that came under attack on Monday, has called on both the British and Irish governments to take action in the wake of the recent attacks. Imam Ibrahim Noonan said "extremists and radical minds" had been visiting and lecturing in certain mosques in Dublin, Cork and Galway. "I do know that the Garda are working hard and doing something, but maybe they are restricted due to human rights law," he told Good Morning Ulster. The imam said his mosque had been attacked during the hour of prayer on Monday, as some people blamed he entire Muslim community in the wake of extremist attacks. "Every time attacks happen, all Muslim communities around Ireland, Northern Ireland, and the rest of the UK become tense," he said. "Ninety-nine, point nine, nine, nine percent don't associate themselves with these terrorist extremists - they are peace loving people."	Irish police say further arrests are expected as part of an investigation into the background of one of the London attackers who lived in the Republic of Ireland.
Those selling the illicit weapons often disassembled and sent them in different packages or embedded them in old stereos or printers, the report found. Researchers found that firearms and related goods generated 136 sales per month and a monthly revenue of $80,000 (Â£62,000). The firearms trade has gained attention following recent terrorist attacks. The dark net is a part of the internet that requires specific software to access, in order for users to remain anonymous. While the trade was unlikely to fuel large-scale terrorist operations, it had the potential to become the platform of choice for "lone-wolf" terrorists to obtain weapons and ammunition, the report said. Non-profit organisation Rand Corporation Europe, working with Manchester University, found 52 unique vendors selling weapons or similar items such as ammunition, explosives, or components such as silencers across 811 listings and 18 markets. Police believe the 2016 Munich shooting, which left nine people dead, used weapons purchased on the dark net. Lead author of the research, Giacomo Persi Paoli, said: "Recent high-profile cases have shown that the threat posed by individuals or small groups obtaining weapons illegally from the dark web is real. "The ability to not only arm criminals and terrorists, who can make virtually anonymous purchases, but also vulnerable and fixated individuals is perhaps the most dangerous aspect." Guns account for less than 1% of items sold on the platform, with its main trade being in narcotics. Nevertheless, the volume being sold "can be considered sufficiently high to be a cause of concern for policy makers and law enforcement agencies", said the report. The study involved collecting data from 12 dark net marketplaces during a week in September 2016. Most of those selling guns were based in the US, but Europe was the most popular destination for the weapons they sold. Judith Aldridge, co-investigator on the study, said: "In very simple terms, anyone can connect to the dark web and within minutes have access to a variety of vendors offering their products, which are most often illegal. "The dark web enables illegal trade at a global level, removing some of the geographical barriers between vendors and buyers, while increasing the personal safety of both buyers and sellers through a series of anonymising features that obscure their identities."	Criminals and terrorists are using the so-called dark net to buy weapons, a new study has suggested.
Her husband, Arif Yunus, was given seven years on similar charges. They have been in prison since their arrest nearly a year ago. Both still face separate charges of treason, which carries a life sentence. The couple say the case was politically motivated. Azerbaijan has repeatedly jailed human rights activists. President Ilham Aliyev has ruled Azerbaijan since 2003 and has cracked down hard on political opponents. Both Leyla, 59, and Arif Yunus are in poor health - she has diabetes and hepatitis C, while he has a heart condition and has suffered two strokes. US-based Human Rights Watch condemned their prosecution as a "despicable political show trial". Levan Asatiani, an Azerbaijan researcher at Amnesty International, said "the judicial system has once again revealed itself to be no more than a cynical tool by which President Ilham Aliyev crushes any dissent". In a statement to the BBC the Azerbaijan government said the court process in the case was "open and free". It also said "the independence of judiciary and the rule of law have been fully guaranteed" in Azerbaijan. Leyla Yunus was found guilty of fraud, illegal entrepreneurship, tax evasion and falsifying official documents. She is director of the Institute for Peace and Democracy, a human rights group founded in 1995. It has worked with the Council of Europe - Europe's leading human rights watchdog - and other international bodies, informing them about actions to stifle political dissent in Azerbaijan. Mrs Yunus had been pressing for reconciliation between oil-rich Azerbaijan and neighbouring Armenia, to defuse their frozen conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh. Armenian forces took control of the disputed territory in 1994 soon after the break-up of the Soviet Union. But sporadic clashes continue between them and nearby Azeri forces. (Update 20 August: This article was amended to add the official viewpoint of the Azerbaijan government.)	A prominent human rights activist in Azerbaijan, Leyla Yunus, has been sentenced to eight-and-a-half years in prison for fraud and tax evasion.
It comes as an Inverness sufferer claimed that his former employer was deliberately ignoring his correspondence. James Nicol believes he was exposed to asbestos while working on council houses in the 1980s. He wants Highland Council to acknowledge that he was exposed. The local authority said it could not comment on Mr Nicol's case, adding that any claims would be handled by solicitors. The 85-year-old worked for Highland Regional Council, now Highland Council, as a labourer. He believes that he came into contact with asbestos while refurbishing council properties in Inverness. Mr Nicol also later worked for the regional council as a school janitor. In March this year, the pensioner was diagnosed with mesothelioma, an incurable lung cancer almost always caused by asbestos exposure. He said he had first noticed a change in his health during a swimming session. "I could swim, but not the same speed and that was why I went to my doctor," Mr Nicol told BBC Scotland. "I went to my GP and from then on it was x-rays, scans and a biopsy in Aberdeen." Mr Nicol was given his diagnosis at his local hospital, Raigmore in Inverness. He said: "The consultant told me it was 'all bad, no cure Mr Nicol'." While still in receipt of a local authority pension, he claims Highland Council has turned its back on him by failing to reply to correspondence from his solicitor on his condition. A Highland Council spokesman said: "We cannot comment on this matter. "However, we can confirm that where individuals appoint solicitors to make claims against Highland Council, communications would be made via the person's solicitor and not direct with the claimant." The charity Clydeside Action on Asbestos was set up in 1984 and initially dealt with shipyard workers. However, senior welfare rights officer and director Phyllis Craig said the charity was now increasingly seeing people from other areas of employment, and also more women. She said: "We are seeing a lot of people from the construction industry and we are seeing teachers, nurses, doctors, policemen and firemen. "Many of them had been exposed 20 years ago. Ms Craig added: "There is a myth that women were only exposed to asbestos if they washed their husband's overalls." She said women were just as prone to the risk of being exposed to asbestos fibres working in a building, such as a hospital or school, as their male colleagues were. Law changes in Scotland give sufferers and their families north of the border more rights than anywhere else in the UK. Some sufferers, such as former textile factory worker Annie McGhee from Motherwell, may be eligible for a one-off payment from the government. She believes she was exposed to asbestos while working at a knitwear factory before she married and raised a family. Mrs McGhee said: "It was the only place where I worked. I worked there for eight years solid. "I worked in the steam presses and there were lots of big pipes up above and there were no windows in the place." Two years ago this month, Mrs McGhee was diagnosed with terminal cancer following a year and half of experiencing shortness of breath because of fluid in her lungs. The use of asbestos was banned in 1999 and campaigners warn that the legacy of the material will continue for decades yet with case numbers unlikely to peak for another 20 years.	Campaigners have called for greater support for victims of asbestos-related cancer who are fighting for civil compensation.
The Bosnia-Herzegovina international is bidding for full match fitness after recovering from a hernia injury but is unlikely to start against QPR. The visitors are without midfielder Jordan Cousins, who will miss the rest of the season with a quadricep injury. On-loan winger Kazenga LuaLua is back in training after an ankle injury but is still a doubt for the visitors. Bristol City head coach Lee Johnson told BBC Radio Bristol: "We move into Friday after a good performance that was much desired against Wolves. Friday is going to be really, really important. "If we can get a win, it really puts everybody else on the back foot, we'll claw another couple in and hopefully we'll push away as well. "It is a massive game. I'm sure the players will give their all. We want to look ahead of us and make sure we overtake a couple of people, with Forest and Burton only a point ahead of us. "Even QPR, six points ahead of us, if we beat them, we cut that gap to three points. That's really important. The more people we draw into it, the better."	Bristol City remain without midfielder Gary O'Neil (leg), but striker Milan Djuric is back in training.
The Taylors will, we are assured, make "quite an entrance" when they arrive in Albert Square this summer, giving the resident Walfordians "a rude awakening". EastEnders executive producer Sean O'Connor describes them as "noisy and brash" who "lack cash" but "have love and warmth in spades". The announcement has split opinion among fans on the soap's Facebook page, with some worried they are a stereotypical white working-class family and/or a pale imitation of the Millers. Others have said there should be more ethnic minority families instead, or have questioned whether they would be able to afford to live in the East End these days. But some are looking forward to what O'Connor described as their "explosive" impact on Walford life. Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

In 2013/14, 99,293 students went to further education colleges, but that fell to 82,818 in 2015/16. The figures have been released by the Department for the Economy (DfE). There was a 15% drop in the number of enrolments at FE colleges over the same period, as some students can be enrolled on more than one course. According to the department, there were 180,825 enrolments at FE colleges in 2013/14, but by 2015/16 that figure had fallen to 153,817. One of the six FE colleges, Belfast Metropolitan College (BMC), had a particularly steep decline in its enrolment in just one year. The number of enrolments at BMC alone fell from 36,685 in 2014/15 to 28,514 in 2015/16 - a decline of 22.3%. When approached to explain why this was the case, they declined to comment. NUS-USI President Fergal McFerran expressed alarm at the "staggering drop" and called on the executive to make a "significant increase in the funding allocation for tertiary education and student financial support in the new budget". The college with the lowest rate of decline was South Eastern Regional College where enrolments fell by 8.3% - from 35,832 in 2013/14 to 32,858 in 2015/16. FE colleges provide a range of courses for a range of learners including: Sources working in the FE sector told the BBC that the decline in enrolments could be down to a range of factors, including budget constraints leading to cuts to courses and staff. In 2015/16 over 400 staff in the FE sector were offered voluntary redundancy. Some also said that leisure, recreational and hobby courses - or non-regulated courses - had been reduced in recent years, leading to a drop in enrolments from life-long learners. The DfE figures indicate that there has been a consequent drop in the number of enrolments to non-regulated courses over the three years. In 2013/14 there were around 39,000 enrolments to recreational courses compared to around 24,500 in 2015/16. This was a result of DfE's 'Further Education Means Business' strategy, which aimed to reduce the number of recreational courses to encourage more "economically focused provision". The chief executive of Colleges NI, Gerry Campbell, said that further education was vital for the future of Northern Ireland's economy. "While there has been a decline in relation to residential and leisure type courses, in many ways over the past two or three years there has been an increasing focus from the colleges and FE sector as a whole to engage more on the provision of economically relevant courses," he said. In a statement the Department of the Economy confirmed that the FE colleges budget had been reduced by Â£10m in 2015/16. However, they said that the enrolment statistics were "largely positive" and showed that an increasing proportion of students were leaving further education with a qualification, meeting the needs of the economy.	There has been a 16% drop in the number of students going to further education colleges in Northern Ireland over the past three years.
Producers of precious metals were particularly hard hit. Analysts blamed falling prices for gold and silver and adverse currency movements. Fresnillo, which owns the world's biggest silver mine, was down 4.5% and Randgold was down 4.2%. "Gold is in no man's land," said Alastair McCaig, market analyst at IG Index. He says that investors are concerned that gold could fall below $1,200 dollars an ounce, which would make some gold mines unviable. Gold is currently trading at $1,266 dollars an ounce. In China iron ore prices fell to the lowest level in almost five years, which hit shares in other miners. Rio Tinto fell 0.73% and BHP Billiton was down 0.37%. BP was 2.59% higher. Shares had slumped 6% on Thursday after a US judge found the firm "grossly negligent" over the 2010 oil spill. The ruling has made investors cautious over the firm. "I'm not buying BP here. The ruling opens up the door in the United States to more fines for BP," said Beaufort Securities sales trader Basil Petrides. "The US government has got its knife out for BP and it's sharpening the blade," he said. On the currency markets the euro was trading 0.13% higher, but still below the $1.30 level. It fell below the $1.30 level on Thursday in reaction to a surprise cut in interest rates by the European Central Bank. The Bank also launched a programme to buy private sector debt, in another effort to boost European economies. The pound was down 0.10% against the dollar at $1.6314.	(Close): The FTSE 100 index of leading blue-chip shares closed the day down by 0.36% at 6853.40.
It includes plans to cut red tape, develop infrastructure and make it easier for companies to do business. The launch comes on the eve of Mr Modi's first visit to the US as prime minister. Manufacturing contributes only 15% to India's gross domestic product; authorities want to raise it to 25%. Mr Modi's 'Make in India' campaign comes a day after India sent its homegrown mission to Mars. The Mangalyaan robotic probe, one of the cheapest interplanetary missions ever, was successfully put into the orbit of Mars on Wednesday morning. "Whenever I met [business] people for the last few years they would tell me - we want to shift out... It pained me that people of nation are forced to leave," Mr Modi said while unveiling the campaign in the capital, Delhi. "We do not want any industrialist being forced to leave India. I can say that we have been able to bring about a change in last few months." Mr Modi said India must "increase manufacturing and at the same time ensure that the benefits reach the youth of our nation". A boost to manufacturing will create jobs, increase purchasing power and create a larger market for manufacturers, he added. India has a huge pool of talented people, Mr Modi said, adding that it was because of this talent that India was able to send the indigenously-built Mangalyaan to the orbit of Mars. Mr Modi won the recent general election, promising to revive India's slowing economy and in the three months to June, the country's economy grew by 5.7% , its fastest pace in two-and-a-half years.	Prime Minister Narendra Modi has launched an ambitious campaign which aims to turn the country into a global manufacturing hub.
A young palaeontologist working with the University of Manchester found the fossil in 2008, in the collections of Doncaster Museum and Art Gallery. He realised it was the 189-million-year-old remains of an ichthyosaur - an extinct marine reptile. Further study confirmed it to be a previously unknown species. The finding has now been published in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology. Dean Lomax, the 25-year-old palaeontologist who studied the specimen, said it was so well preserved he could determine the contents of its stomach. "We could see tiny hook-shaped features that were actually the hooks from the tentacles of squid," he said. "So we know what its last meal was." Mr Lomax worked with Prof Judy Massare, from the State University of New York, comparing the specimen's fossilised bones with those of almost 1,000 other ichthyosaurs in museums in the US and Europe. Mr Lomax explained that subtle anatomical features in its fin bones set the species apart from others. It is not uncommon to find ichthyosaur fossils in England. The sharp-toothed marine reptiles swam in large numbers in the seas around Britain when the dinosaurs roamed. This particular specimen was found in the rocks of Dorset's Jurassic Coast in the early 1980s and brought to the museum, so it is not clear how it was eventually mistaken for a copy. Dr Silvia Danise from Plymouth University said its "rediscovery" was a "striking example of how important museum collections are for scientific research". "Collections are treasures that show their value each time we're able to look at them with a different perspective, and by asking new scientific questions," she told BBC News. Dr Blanca Huertas, from the Natural History Museum in London, pointed out that there were still many species to discover in museum collections. "Sometimes we discover things in the field," she said, "but the collections are an incredible source of opportunities, since visiting them, people can study specimens and collections from hundreds of places across the entire planet and travel in time." Source: Encyclopaedia of Paleontology. This new species has now been named Ichthyosaurus anningae - in honour of Mary Anning, the British fossil-hunter who discovered the first ichthyosaur on the Dorset coast in about 1811. The hope now is that news about the significance of this ancient specimen might help track down the fossil hunter who found it. Dr Stephen Brusatte, a palaeontologist from the University of Edinburgh added that there was "a whole lot more still to find out there". He told BBC News: "Palaeontology is a unique science because you don't need an advanced degree or specialised training to find a fossil, just patience and a keen set of eyes."	A fossil stored in a Doncaster museum for 30 years and thought to be a plaster copy has turned out to be a new species of ancient reptile.
The Mediterranean gull and black-headed gull eggs were illegally harvested from from islands in Poole Harbour, Dorset. The theft has been branded "sickening" by bird charity Birds of Poole Harbour. The group said some eggs - sometimes eaten as a delicacy - were not cleared for human consumption. Dorset Police and Natural England have launched an investigation. Natural England is urging any restaurants or pubs to ask to see a valid licence before buying eggs to prepare in meals. Birds of Poole Harbour had been surveying a group of islands in the harbour when the theft was discovered. Mediterranean gulls are classified as a Schedule One species, meaning anyone disturbing their nests must have a special licence. Paul Morton, who runs the charity, said Mediterranean gulls' eggs were not approved for human consumption, and could be a "health issue". "I'm distraught, really. To see the taking of hundreds and hundreds of eggs from an important colony is quite sickening," he said. Mr Moreton said there had been previous convictions for egg poaching in the last 10 or 15 years. He said continued monitoring was needed to understand the effect on the gull population in the harbour, which he said had fallen by 70% since 2008.	Hundreds of eggs belonging to a protected species of bird have been stolen from an important nesting site, with fears they could be sold to the restaurant industry.
In the year to the end of March, 57 victims of homicide (murders and culpable homicides) were recorded - down five on the previous 12 months. This is the lowest number of recorded homicide cases for a single 12-month period since 1976 and half the figure of nine years ago. As of 31 March 2016, only one case of homicide recorded in 2015-16 was unresolved. The report Homicide in Scotland showed that a sharp instrument remained the most common method of killing in Scotland and accounted for 51% of homicides (29 cases) in 2015-16. Nearly all of these cases (26 out of 29) involved a knife. While the majority of the accused had an unknown status for alcohol and drugs, 31% (20 people) were identified by the police as being under the influence of alcohol or alcohol and drugs. Justice Secretary Michael Matheson said: "While it is encouraging to see continued falls in homicide cases alongside the long-term decline in violent crime, the sustained efforts that have helped achieve this - through education and enforcement - must continue, because each of the lives lost is one life too many. "There is a clear role across a range of public services, in addition to the critical work of our police, to continue to support communities that may remain at risk from violent crime and to challenge irresponsible attitudes both to alcohol misuse and to so-called 'casual' violence. "We will continue to work with partners and invest in a range of projects to help steer our young people away from the risks of a life of violence and crime, while also ensuring our law enforcement agencies and the courts have the powers and resources needed to deal with those who do harm to others." Scottish Labour's justice spokeswoman Claire Baker said: "Whilst I welcome the overall downward trend in homicides in Scotland we have to take these statistics with a note of caution. "Last year when the Scottish government were heralding 'record low' homicide figures after a supposed similar drop, the actual figures were being revised upwards to show an increase. "Meanwhile, sexual crime in Scotland sits at a 45-year high and in the past year we have seen an increase in violent crime with attempted murder and serious assault rising by a staggering 27%." The number of homicide victims for 2014-15 stood at 59 last year but later increased to 62, after three cases were reclassified following deaths.	The number of murders in Scotland has fallen again, according to new figures.
Charli XCX, Ella Eyre and Lianne La Havas will appear alongside The Chemical Brothers and Underworld. Other festivals have been criticised for the lack of women on their bills. Last week, music blog Crack in the Road posted images of edited posters removing all the names of male performers. The rather blank-looking page was shared on social media, with the bills at Reading and Leeds, Download and T in the Park also a focus for criticism. Neneh Cherry, Andreya Triana and Radio 1 DJ B.Traits are among other female acts to be announced by Bestival. Organiser Rob da Bank said: "There are shed-loads of amazing people making some startlingly good music at the moment and look, lots of them are female." This year's Bestival theme is Summer of Love. It takes place at Robin Hill Country Park on the Isle of Wight between 10 and 13 September, with 25 stages on offer. Follow @BBCNewsbeat on Twitter and Radio1Newsbeat on YouTube	Bestival has revealed an all-female line-up in its second wave of announcements for this year's Isle of Wight event.
Commanders lowered the flag during a ceremony in Kabul - raising the flag of the new mission named Resolute Support. "We have lifted the Afghan people out of the darkness of  despair and given them hope for the future," mission commander Gen John  Campbell said. Nato's Afghan deployment began after the 9/11 attacks against the US. From 1 January the alliance's role will shift to a mainly training and support mission for the Afghan army. Sunday's ceremony was low-key - held inside a gymnasium at the alliance headquarters away from the public. A military band played as the flag of the International Security and Assistance Force (Isaf) was lowered in the presence of senior military personnel from both sides. Unfurling the new flag, Gen Campbell said the mission "will serve as the bedrock of an enduring partnership" between Nato and Afghanistan. "We honour coalition and Afghan fallen in this mighty struggle, those who paid the price for Afghanistan's freedom," he said, adding: "The road before us remains challenging but we will triumph." At its peak, the US-led Isaf deployment involved more than 130,000 personnel from 50 countries. But from 1 January, it will bring together around 12,000 men and women from Nato allies and 14 partner nations. "The security of Afghanistan will be fully in the hands of the country's 350,000 Afghan soldiers and police. But Nato allies, together with many partner nations, will remain to train, advise and assist them," said Nato Secretary General  Jens Stoltenberg in a statement. More than a decade after this long and expensive mission began, the Taliban are still active and gaining in strength, launching a number of attacks in recent months, says the BBC's Sanjoy Majumder in Kabul. This year has been the bloodiest in Afghanistan since 2001, with at least 4,600 members of the Afghan security forces dying in the fight against the Taliban. It underscores the challenges that lie ahead of the Afghan security forces, our correspondent says. Nearly 3,500 foreign troops have been killed since the beginning of the Nato mission.	Nato has formally ended its 13-year combat mission in Afghanistan - heralding the start of a new phase of support for local Afghan troops.
Two reports, published in November, criticised the regulator at the time for failing to take action. One of those reports, by barrister Andrew Green QC, said regulators should consider banning 10 former HBOS executives. A new investigation has now been announced by regulators. "The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) have decided to start investigations into certain former HBOS senior managers," the regulators said. "These investigations will determine whether or not any prohibition proceedings should be commenced against them. The FCA and PRA continue to review materials with a view to making further decisions regarding other former HBOS senior managers." No details are being given as to the exact nature of the investigations, who is being investigated, or the timeframe of the inquiry. A Bank of England/FCA report examined the failure of HBOS, while Mr Green examined decisions taken by the Financial Services Authority, the City regulator at the time of the HBOS demise. Both were published in November. So far the only person to have been banned is Peter Cummings, who was previously the head of corporate lending at HBOS. In 2012, he was fined Â£500,000, and banned from senior positions in banking. In his report, Mr Green suggested that the Bank of England's PRA and the FCA should consider prohibition proceedings against former executives. That included Andy Hornby, HBOS chief executive from 2006 to 2009. Mr Green said the FSA was "misguided" when it took the decision not to take action against Mr Hornby. Other former HBOS executives named in the report included Lord Stevenson, and Mike Ellis, the former group finance director at HBOS. Lindsay Mackay, the head of HBOS's Treasury division from 2004, could also be banned, November's report said. James Crosby, HBOS chief executive from 2001 to 2006, has retired. He gave up his knighthood in 2009, and surrendered part of his pension. Eight former non-executive directors of HBOS were criticised in the report, although they said they disagreed with its findings. The eight, including Lord Stevenson and Carphone Warehouse founder Sir Charles Dunstone, said the report had downplayed the "unforeseeable" effects of the financial crisis.	Regulators are to begin investigations into senior managers at HBOS, the bank which collapsed during the financial crisis.
Knox, 30, has arranged a practice round at Augusta with the 1988 winner. "It's not every tournament you have a fellow Scot and past champion to show you around," Knox told BBC Scotland. "I'm looking forward to it and hopefully he'll give me some great insider tips that he's learned over the years that might help me." Lyle, 58, qualifies as a winner of the Green Jacket, and US-based Knox is the only other Scotsman in the field. Inverness-born Knox leapt up the rankings in November with victory at WGC-HSBC Champions event in Shanghai and is currently No.34 in the world. "I still can't quite believe I'm playing at the Masters," he enthused. "Growing up watching it on TV, now it's my turn to play. It's truly an amazing honour." Knox has had a taste of the other majors, finishing in a tie for 45th at the US Open in 2013, featuring at the US PGA Championship in 2014 and 2015 and making his Open debut as a reserve at St Andrews last year. "I've only been to Augusta once before," explained Knox, one of British golf's most promising players. "It's the most famous course in the world pretty much. Obviously, St Andrews is right up there too. "Being the first major of the year and with all the history, Augusta just has this hype around it and golf is in a great place right now with so many young, amazing players. "There's such a buzz around the tournament. The crowds seem amazing and then there's the condition of the course. "The whole thing is magical, a golfer's dream, and I can't wait to be a part of it."	Russell Knox aims to tap into the experience of former champion Sandy Lyle as he prepares to make his Masters debut next week.
They said they had received an anonymous threat, two days after the killing of five police officers. A nearby parking lot was searched for a "suspicious person" but no-one was found. SWAT officers were earlier deployed at the main building. On Thursday, five white police officers were shot dead by a black man, Micah Johnson, during a protest rally. The march was against the killing of black men by police. Two deaths this week have led to nationwide protests. Dallas police said its officers - using dogs - searched the parking lot but the hunt turned up nothing. In a statement earlier on Saturday, the police said: "The Dallas Police Department received an anonymous threat against law enforcement across the city and has taken precautionary measures to heighten security." An armoured vehicle was moved close to the main HQ in central Dallas and heavily armed officers were seen nearby, according to the Associated Press news agency. But it added that members of the public were still able to walk about freely around the building. The police asked media to stop all live feeds around HQ "for the safety of our officers", the BBC's James Cook reports. The shooting happened late on Thursday during the protest march. Johnson, who was himself killed during the assault, supported black militant groups who encouraged violence against police. Dallas police chief David Brown said Johnson had told a negotiator that he had wanted to kill white people, especially white police officers, because he was angry about the recent shootings of black men by police. The attack came after the police killings of Philando Castile in Minnesota and Alton Sterling in Louisiana. Earlier on Saturday, President Barack Obama said the US was "not as divided as some have suggested" in the wake of the shootings involving African-Americans. He said Americans of "all races, all backgrounds", including many of those who were protesting, were outraged by the Dallas killings. As well as the five police officers killed, another seven were injured on Thursday. Two civilians were also hurt. Johnson, 25, who officials say acted alone, was killed by remotely detonated explosives that were sent into a car park where he had taken refuge after the shootings. He was a member of the US Army Reserve from 2009 to 2015 who had served in Afghanistan. Bomb-making material, rifles and a combat journal were found in his home in the Dallas suburb of Mesquite. A number of gun attacks involving police officers and civilians have occurred in other parts of the US in the aftermath of the deaths in Minnesota and Louisiana. Leaders of the Black Lives Matter organisation have condemned the Dallas killings but say planned marches, including a "Weekend of Rage" in Philadelphia, will go ahead.	Dallas police have given the all clear, hours after security levels were raised at their headquarters in the city.
A row has broken out after Mr Gill attacked Neil Hamilton for offering support on the £1.1bn M4 relief road. Mr Gill denies it was the group's view, but Mr Hamilton said his colleague was late for the meeting where it was agreed. The MEP said he is fully involved in all of his jobs. Meanwhile UKIP has handed out spokespeople roles to all of its AMs - with the exception of Mr Gill. Mr Hamilton became leader of the UKIP group in May despite Mr Gill being and remaining Wales party leader. "UKIP members expect all UKIP AMs to be fully committed to their role in the Senedd and to be team players," said Mr Hamilton. "If Nathan cannot accept this, he should fulfil his commitment to the UKIP NEC (national executive committee) and Nigel Farage last January that he would not 'double-job'." The AM for Mid and West Wales added: "Nathan Gill is a part-time AM at the moment because he has not resigned from his job as an MEP in Brussels and Strasbourg. "He arrived late at our group meeting yesterday, when it was nearly over, so he missed our discussion about the M4. "He has at no time expressed any misgivings to me." Mr Hamilton told the assembly on Wednesday that UKIP was prepared to back the preferred relief road option of First Minister Carwyn Jones, a £1.1bn new motorway known as the black route. He said: "We think the black route is better than no route, and so if this is necessary to unblock the logjam we are prepared to play our part in it." Mr Hamilton said his statement in the assembly had been endorsed by everyone present at the group meeting, where the issue was "fully discussed" and had the backing of UKIP South Wales East AM David Rowlands, who will speak for the party on transport. UKIP's election manifesto said it did not agree with the black route plan "due to its excessive £1bn plus cost" - backing instead the "blue route" scheme to upgrade Newport roads. On Thursday, Mr Gill told BBC Wales: "Giving Carwyn false hope that he's going to get the black route through is not the right thing to do." He added: "We back the blue route. That is our manifesto position." Asked if Mr Hamilton's comments represented a group position, Mr Gill said: "No." He has previously said he would stand down from the European role but is yet to do so, with suggestions he would wait until after the EU poll on 23 June. Mr Gill, who is the only AM who is an MEP, later said in response to Mr Hamilton: "What evidence does he have that I am a part time AM? "I am fully involved in all of my jobs and I am doing everything I am supposed to be doing." He said that the other two AMs in the UKIP European election list, who could take the job after he stands down, are now AMs themselves. "We always said all along that we wouldn't do anything until after the referendum," he said. A spokesman for Mr Gill said: "Nathan has attended every major function that has gone on in the assembly since he was elected. "His comments on the M4 route were simply fulfilling his manifesto promise and his commitment to the A55 in North Wales." Mark Reckless, AM for South Wales East, said the matter had been discussed at a UKIP group meeting. "We continue to support the blue route - we prefer that to the black route," Mr Reckless said. But he added: "As Neil said yesterday, it's crucial that we get the M4 relief road and we would be happy for negotiations with government in respect of the black route. "If they were willing to abolish the Severn Bridge tolls, I feel that is a deal that might be attractive." Meanwhile UKIP has announced the following AMs as its spokespeople: Asked why Mr Gill was left off the list of UKIP assembly spokespeople, Mr Hamilton said: "When he has finally made his decision about which job he prefers and if he remains an AM, I will happily look at appointing him as a spokesman. "Providing of course, he is prepared to abide by collective responsibility."	The leader of the UKIP Welsh Assembly group says Nathan Gill should not "double job" as both MEP and AM if he cannot fully commit to Cardiff Bay.
The family of Joseph Mulhern, who was shot by the IRA in 1993, believe his death will feature in the inquiry, but they are bitterly divided over whether or not it should even take place. Mr Mulhern met a lonely, untimely death in July 1993. The 23-year-old was abducted and shot by the IRA, who alleged he was a police informer. His body was found on a remote hillside on the border between counties Tyrone and Donegal, dressed in a blue boiler suit and his hands tied with cable. Those were the tell-tale signs that he had been tortured before he was shot. For a long period during Northern Ireland's Troubles, Stakeknife was running the IRA's internal security unit, otherwise known as the 'nutting squad'. Stakeknife has been been named by the media as Freddie Scappaticci. But the west Belfast man denies the allegation. The secret agent is to be investigated in connection with the murders of up to 50 people. It is an inquiry that Joseph Mulhern's father Frank fully supports. "Stakeknife was employed by the state," he said. "Stakeknife knew when a lot of these murders were going to take place. "He obviously reported to his handlers and they did nothing to stop these murders. "The IRA have pulled the trigger but the state authorities could have prevented it as they would have known about it a number of weeks before [Joseph] was taken away. "Why did they not act?" But that is not the view of the entire family. One of those who carried Joseph Mulhern's coffin was his younger brother Fran, then aged 18. Not long afterwards, he left Belfast to study law in England and settled there. He feels the Stakeknife inquiry is focusing on the wrong people. He said: "The thing that I feel is really strange is that everyone is talking about Scappaticci, but ultimately what about the people who actually pulled the triggers? "It just seems like they are getting a free pass. "So, to me, the whole thing just smacks of being almost this inquiry to use as a political football to beat the British government with." Asked if he would welcome an inquiry that could shed light on what happened to his brother, he replied: "No, because it is not going to bring my brother back. "It keeps dragging up the past," he said. "And the second thing it does, is its just money that Northern Ireland does not have." It has been suggested the inquiry could cost Â£5m a year for five years. But those who have argued for it, like Joseph Mulhern's father Frank, say that figure has been deliberately inflated. "That sum has been mentioned, probably by the state authorities here, to try to make up excuses why they should not have an investigation," Frank Mulhern said. "They don't need to spent Â£35m because they have all their information and files in Castlereagh or Whitehall or wherever they keep their files." Fran Mulhern said he believes the way the government is dealing with past - by holding inquiries into some deaths but not others  - is not only unfair but is hampering political progress and reconciliation. "Either you provide something for all of the victims or you deal with none of them," he said. "You can't cherry-pick, and for me that is the big problem. "It seems to be we are going to look at this, but we are not going to look at that. "The young girl who lost her dad because he was in the [Royal Ulster Constabulary] and was killed by a mortar bomb has every bit as much right as someone who lost a family member at Loughgall or wherever. "Picking and choosing creates resentment and it doesn't allow the province to move on." Fran Mulhern lives in the north of England and rarely returns to Belfast. He is the only remaining male sibling in his family. The archive television footage of Joseph's funeral shows younger brother Liam, then aged eight, carrying a single red rose behind the coffin. By the time he was 15, Liam Mulhern was on remand accused of offences linked to the Continuity IRA. He was later jailed for dissident republican activities and died two years ago after taking ill in Maghaberry Prison. The two Mulhern brothers are buried in Belfast's City Cemetery beside their mother who died when they were children.	The activities of the army's most high-ranking agent, codenamed Stakeknife, are to be investigated but a date for the inquiry has yet to be set.
Ormsby had already agreed to join Giants for the 2017 season, having made two appearances during a one-month loan spell with the club in April. The 23-year-old scored 29 tries in 42 games for Warrington, but played in only five games this season. "I wanted to get game time, so it's good for my career to be here," he told Huddersfield's club website.	Warrington winger Gene Ormsby has joined Super League rivals Huddersfield Giants with immediate effect.
The 27-year-old has agreed a three-year contract with Sarries and will move to Allianz Park this summer. Clark made his Premiership debut aged 18 for Leeds in 2007 and he has won one international cap for England, which came against France in August 2015. "Calum is a very talented player and will fit in brilliantly here," Saracens director of rugby Mark McCall said. "He is still a player with a huge amount of potential and in our opinion he has his best years ahead of him." Clark is Saracens' third signing for the 2017-18 season, after the announcements Wales international Liam Williams and Toulouse hooker Christopher Tolofua will join the European and Premiership champions.	Saracens have agreed a deal to sign flanker Calum Clark from fellow Premiership side Northampton Saints.
Ross-shire Engineering has secured the potential investment across the next five years supplying equipment to Scottish Water. The firm in Muir of Ord has already created 100 new jobs to allow it meet the needs of the utility company. The investment has also provided additional job security to the existing 273 staff members. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon visited the company's premises near Inverness on Monday, following a tour of Nigg Energy Park on the Cromarty Firth. She said: "Ensuring a strong rural economy is crucial to Scotland's success. "This funding Ross-Shire Engineering has secured provides a hugely welcome boost in providing skilled jobs and investment across the Highlands, as well as providing vital utility services to Scotland's homes and businesses. "In particular, I am delighted they will be investing in their already strong apprenticeship job programme, providing vital training and employment to young people living in the Highlands in a competitive jobs market." The first minister added: "Last week when I set out my Programme for Government I promised to protect Scotland's interests, particularly our economic interests, in the wake of the EU referendum. "Driving sustainable economic growth is at the heart of that, and I am committed to ensuring this government does all it can to ensure Scotland's rural economy remains prosperous for future generations."	Funding of up to £200m has helped create new jobs at a Highlands engineering company.
Gillian Triggs told a senate committee that she had been asked to resign and offered a new role. The shadow attorney general has written to the Australian Federal Police (AFP) seeking an immediate investigation. The HRC released a report condemning the treatment of children in detention. Their report said that detaining children of asylum seekers violated international human rights law, and called for their release. Speaking to journalists in Sydney on Wednesday, Mr Abbott repeated his earlier statements that the government had lost confidence in Ms Triggs as president of the HRC. "What she does is a matter for her," said Mr Abbott in response to a question about whether she should resign. "As the secretary of the Attorney General's Department has made clear, she was not asked to resign and no inducement has been offered." On Tuesday, Australia's Prime Minister Tony Abbott launched a scathing attack on the HRC report, saying that it was a "political stitch-up". Earlier in a senate hearing, Ms Triggs said that she had been asked to resign during a meeting on 3 February by the secretary of Attorney General George Brandis' department. "I rejected it out of hand," she said, as quoted by ABC News. Ms Triggs told the hearing that the department's secretary, Chris Moraitis, had said that she would be offered another job with the government. She added that she had been "very shaken and shocked" by the "disgraceful proposal" and had reminded Mr Moraitis that she had a five-year statutory position. In a letter to the AFP commissioner, Shadow Attorney General Mark Dreyfus said: "The attorney general's offer to an independent statutory officer of an inducement to resign her position as president, with the object of affecting the leadership of the [HRC] to avoid political damage to the Abbott government may constitute corrupt and unlawful conduct." ABC News reported that Mr Dreyfus said that Ms Triggs preferred not to use the term "inducement" but that she had made it clear that the resignation request and the offer of a job had been connected. Local media reported that Mr Moraitis has denied asking Ms Triggs to resign but said they had discussed the possibility of her taking on another role. The attorney general admitted to the senate committee that he had lost confidence in Ms Triggs because of the timing of the inquiry into detained children, according to local media. He added that "as a matter of goodwill" he had told Mr Moraitis that he hoped that she could be encouraged to serve the government in other capacities. The HRC report, entitled The Forgotten Children, was published earlier in February. It said a third of detained children had developed mental illnesses of such severity that they required psychiatric treatment. The number of children in detention has fallen under Mr Abbott's government. He has questioned why the HRC did not launch an inquiry when the Labor government was in power and there were almost 2,000 children in detention centres. Successive Australian governments have been criticised over their harsh asylum policies, under which asylum seekers are detained for long periods in offshore camps while their applications are processed.	Australia's opposition Labor Party has asked police to investigate whether the government tried to induce the president of the Australian Human Rights Commission (HRC) to resign.
The US network said it was "not an easy decision" and had "enormous respect" for its creators and cast. Set in the 1970s, the series told of a charismatic record executive trying to revive his struggling label. Its ensemble cast included Bobby Cannavale in the lead role, Olivia Wilde as his wife and Sir Mick's son James as a rebellious British singer. Sir Mick and Scorsese were among the show's executive producers, with the latter directing its pilot episode. The series premiere in February was watched by 764,000 viewers, though the average audience subsequently dipped to 650,000. "After careful consideration, we have decided not to proceed with a second season of Vinyl," HBO said in a statement. "We have enormous respect for the creative team and cast for their hard work and passion on this project." Ray Romano, another actor in the cast, told an Australian newspaper on Thursday the cancellation felt like "a knife in the guts". Wilde, meanwhile, thanked her Twitter followers for their "kind words" and said she had been part of "something special".	Sir Mick Jagger and Martin Scorsese's music business-based drama Vinyl has been cancelled by HBO after one season.
Both sides had chances before the Pars' Ryan Wallace drilled a low shot into the bottom corner with 15 minutes left. The lead last just two minutes as Ross Davidson got the last touch on a free-kick into the area. The home side dominated the closing stages but could could not deny Rovers, who remain in fifth place. Rovers remain level with Airdrieonians, who drew at home with Forfar Athletic.	Scottish League One leaders Dunfermline Athletic were held at home by Albion Rovers but still moved 11 points clear at the top of the table.
Pupils aged 11 will be expected to know their tables up to 12x12, and will be tested using an "on-screen check". The checks will be piloted to about 3,000 pupils in 80 primary schools this summer, before being rolled out across the country in 2017. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan said maths was a non-negotiable aspect of a good education. The "on-screen check" examination will involve children completing multiplication challenges against the clock, which will be scored instantly. The Department for Education says it is the first use of on-screen technology in National Curriculum tests. Ms Morgan has also said teachers will be judged by the results of the tests: "Since 2010, we've seen record numbers of 11 year olds start secondary school with a good grasp of the three Rs. But some continue to struggle. "That is why, as part of our commitment to extend opportunity and deliver educational excellence everywhere we are introducing a new check to ensure that all pupils know their times tables by age 11. "They will help teachers recognise those pupils at risk of falling behind and allow us to target those areas where children aren't being given a fair shot to succeed." In 2015, 80% of Year 6 pupils achieved Level 4 in maths, reading and writing, up from 78% last year. But Labour says standards are being threatened by a shortage of teachers, and in the past some teaching unions have warned additional tests can place unwelcome pressure on teachers and pupils.	Every pupil in England will be tested on their times tables before leaving primary school, under government plans.
Scotland Yard said the 37-year-old was held at his home address under Section 41 of the Terrorism Act 2000. Officers from the Metropolitan Police are searching the property. He has been taken to a south London police station and is being questioned by officers from the counter terrorism command unit.	A man has been arrested in north-west London on suspicion of involvement in production of improvised explosive devices in Iraq in 2007.
Police say the individuals were using software designed to remotely control computers - allowing for the stealing of information. The other arrests were made in Estonia, France, Romania, Latvia, Italy, and Norway. The practice, which in some instances can grant access to a victim's webcam, is known as "Ratting". The phrase takes its name from the malicious software used to gain control - Remote Access Trojans (Rats). Using Rats to view people through their own webcams, without their knowledge, is becoming "increasingly common" according to the UK government-backed Get Safe Online advice website. The National Crime Agency (NCA) said it arrested two 33-year-old men, and a 30-year-old woman, in Leeds. A 20-year-old man was arrested in Chatham, Kent, while a 19-year-old man had his home searched in Liverpool and was brought in for "voluntary questioning". They are all accused of knowingly using Rats to spy on multiple targets. "Victims are typically infected by being convinced to click on a link purporting to be a picture or video, or disguised as a legitimate file, but is instead an installer for the Rat," the NCA explained in a statement. "In many cases, those who unwittingly install such trojans will have no indication that their machine is infected." Source: ChildNet International and Ceop As well as the arrests, the NCA said it was warning other users that the software was illegal, and its use would result in further action. "The illegal use of Remote Access Trojans is a significant cybercrime threat, demanding this kind of strong, co-ordinated response from international to local UK level," said Andy Archibald, deputy director of the NCA's National Cyber Crime Unit. "Suspected users of Rats are continuing to find that, despite having no physical contact or interaction with their victims, they can still be identified, tracked down and arrested by the NCA and its partners." An investigation by BBC Radio 5 live in June last year looked into the growing problem of Ratting. One victim, student Rachel Hyndman, told the station: "I was sitting in the bath, trying to relax, and suddenly someone potentially has access to me in this incredibly private moment and it's horrifying. "To have it happen to you without your consent is horribly violating." The investigation uncovered websites where hackers share pictures and videos of their victims.

NHS England guidelines say that 85% of patients should wait a maximum of 62 days to begin their first treatment following referral from their GP. But figures show this slipped to 84.4% from January to March this year. Charities Cancer Research UK and Macmillan Cancer Support both said it was a worrying sign. The target for treating people diagnosed with cancer within 62 days fell from 85.8% during the previous quarter to 84.4% in the first three months of 2014. Mike Hobday, director of policy and research at Macmillan Cancer Support, said the number of trusts missing this target had doubled over the last year. "This is a clear warning sign that the NHS is under huge strain. "The UK already has some of the worst cancer survival rates in Europe. "More patients are now facing delays, which means more patients are facing anxiety for longer and more lives are being put at risk. "We're very worried that the coordination of cancer care is getting worse and that cancer is being overlooked in the new NHS." He said cancer patients were set to increase from two million to three million by 2020. Sarah Woolnough, executive director of policy and information at Cancer Research UK, said some patients were being failed. "The breach of the '62 day target' is very concerning, particularly as four in 10 of those who aren't treated within two months are having to wait three months or more. "These targets exist to encourage swift diagnosis of cancer and access to treatment, which is vital to improve survival rates. "Patients want confidence that suspected cancer is taken seriously and prioritised by the NHS. We hope urgent action will be taken to ensure this breach is a one off." Sean Duffy, national clinical director for cancer for NHS England, said work must be done to make sure standards are met. "It is vital cancer patients are diagnosed and treated quickly so they have the best possible chance of recovery," he said. "Latest figures show nationally the NHS has met and exceeded seven out of eight cancer waiting time standards. But there is variation in meeting the challenging standards, and national performance against one of the targets has dipped." He said clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) were working with local providers in areas where the standard is not being met to ensure patients are treated quickly. Other figures released by NHS England on cancer waiting times showed the number of people seen by a specialist within two weeks of an urgent GP referral for suspected cancer also dropped from 95.6% to 95%. For people urgently referred for breast symptoms, where cancer is not suspected, 93.9% are being seen within two weeks, compared to 95.5% previously. The target is 93%. In total, 60,425 patients with breast symptoms where cancer was not initially suspected were seen in the first three months of this year after being urgently referred.	A key government target for treating people diagnosed with suspected cancer has been breached for the first time since it was introduced in 2009.
The incident was reported near junction 16 at Johnstonebridge at about 14:20. Police said that six vehicles had been involved and lanes on the southbound carriageway were blocked for a time but the route was subsequently cleared. In another incident a car was reported to have ended up on its roof on the northbound carriageway. It follows a string of incidents on the motorway on Sunday in similar weather conditions. Policing units attended about 40 crashes - primarily on the A74(M) - throughout the day. A number were also reported on the A75 near Carrutherstown. "Thankfully the majority of the crashes were fairly minor in nature and as a result there were only three persons slightly injured," said a police spokesman. "The crashes occurred as a result of freak hail showers in various locations throughout the region making driving conditions hazardous. "Please remember that although it is now March and temperatures are generally higher, weather conditions are still very changeable so please take time to have a look at the weather forecast prior to your journey so that you may be better informed of the conditions ahead."	A multi-vehicle crash has taken place during a heavy hail shower on the A74(M) after a spate of incidents in similar conditions on Sunday.
Network Rail said it would provide Twitter updates of engineers installing new freight lines over Easter weekend. But Railway Magazine said the firm's PR team had gone into overdrive after work overran during the festive period leading to heavy criticism. The rail firm said they would "definitely have a story to tell". Major work, including extensive signalling improvements, is being carried out on the route from Good Friday to Easter Monday. Patrick Hallgate, from Network Rail, said: "We are acutely aware that some of our work could inconvenience those who want to travel over the Easter period. "Which is why we want to be open and provide the public with live information about how we are using this time to make improvements to this part of the network." Railway Magazine assistant editor Nick Brodrick said this live feed is a result of "the embarrassing fallout caused by the delayed engineering works on the East Coast Main Line after Christmas". He said: "It is therefore not surprising to see its PR team go into overdrive to reassure passengers that it can deliver on its promises." He added that following the minutiae of rail engineering works would not be a popular pastime this Easter. "Most people won't be particularly interested in the nuts and bolts of the work involved; what they expect is a better train service as a result." The improvement work can be followed on Twitter from Friday morning via @networkrailgwrm and the hashtag #greaterwest.	A social media feed of rail works at Reading is due to the "embarrassing fallout" of engineering delays at Christmas, it has been claimed.
The first of six boxes was unveiled on Tottenham Court Road this week. The service is free to use although users will be shown adverts as they wait for their phone to charge. Many of the UK's red telephone boxes have largely fallen into disuse although some are being revived as libraries or being fitted with medical equipment. The boxes have had a makeover for the project - painted green and fitted with a roof-mounted 86cm solar panel. Inside there are a variety of charging stations for different models of phone and a screen which shows adverts. The advertising screen is reinforced to deter vandals and the boxes are maintained daily and locked overnight. The project was the brainchild of two geography students turned entrepreneurs Harold Craston and Kirsty Kenny. Both studied at the London School of Economics (LSE) and were interested in finding new ways to use public spaces. "I lived next to a phone box in my second year at uni and walked past it every day. I thought, 'There are 8,000 of these lying unused in London and we must be able to find a use for them,'" explained Mr Craston. The solarbox can charge up to 100 phones a day, offering a 20% battery boost in 10 minutes. Since launch, about six people per hour use the booth, according to the founder. Running out of battery is a perennial problem for smartphone users as they become ever more powerful without an equivalent technology leap in battery life. "On launch day, my phone ran out of battery and I genuinely had to use the box," said Mr Craston. Solarbox won second place in the Mayor of London's Low Carbon Entrepreneur of the Year Award earlier this year and also won the LSE's Emerging Entrepreneur of the Year award. Five more boxes will be rolled out by April 2015. Funded by advertising, the founders are keen to make sure users are engaged by "short, fun and exciting ads showing exclusive content". Firms signed up include Tinder and Uber, and 30% of advertising space is reserved for community projects.	Disused phone boxes in London are being put to a novel use - as solar-powered charging stations for mobile phones.
The sell-out event brought 75,000 people from around the world to see a spectacular fireworks and laser show bring in 2017. The Edinburgh celebrations claim to be the UK's largest outdoor winter festival celebrations. Entertainers performing for the crowds included Paolo Nutini, The Charlatans, Fatherson and Be Charlotte. Al Thomson, the director of organisers Unique Events, said: "What a great night. Paolo Nutini rocked the Concert in the Gardens, and revellers across the street party enjoyed a superb line-up across the four stages. "What a great way to start 2017, the 70th anniversary of Edinburgh becoming a world-leading festival city." Preliminary figures from Police Scotland indicated there were only two arrests for minor offences. The Edinburgh events are estimated to be worth more than £40m to the Scottish economy. Members of the public were allowed back on to Calton Hill this year after a ban over safety fears was lifted. Council officials decided to shut the city landmark for six hours over the bells last year saying "the hill was unlit and uneven under foot". However, the City of Edinburgh Council decided to do a U-turn following a review of last year's events. Some fireworks were also fired from the hill as part of the midnight display. More than 1,000 hours of planning goes into delivering the Midnight Moment at Edinburgh's Hogmanay Street Party, widely regarded as the UK's most intense six minutes of fireworks. There is 8km of wire connecting up to 94 modules, each with 32 cues, to deliver the 2.6 tonnes of fireworks up to 300m above the Edinburgh skyline. They are fired by 14 pyrotechnicians from Titanium Fireworks. There were more than 10,000 shots and stars in every firework colour.

They are fired by 14 pyrotechnicians from Titanium Fireworks. There were more than 10,000 shots and stars in every firework colour. Nearly 10 tonnes of equipment were used, filling three lorries and five vans. A team of more than 25 people from Titanium Fireworks, Unique Events and Historic Scotland worked into the night to clear, in eight hours, what took five days to set up. All the empty cardboard tubes will be recycled - enough to fill three large skips - as well as a metre square crate with igniter wire. The Hogmanay celebrations followed a torchlight procession from The Mound to Calton Hill on Friday.	Organisers of Edinburgh's Hogmanay have described the event as a "major success".
Imagine a situation where most people with a common condition are undiagnosed and where opportunities are repeatedly missed to identify the problem and to offer good care. What is this condition? It's dying. Each year, an estimated 92,000 people in England are believed to need end of life care but not receive it. As a practising GP I have seen distressed relatives after a patient has died in hospital. Often they have not had a chance to see their relative before they died and were unaware of the seriousness of the condition, despite repeated admissions with deteriorating conditions. Many such patients are never formally identified as at risk of dying and not assessed for end of life care. One relative said something that haunts me to this day: "I wish the doctors had told me that my mother was dying." As a result too many people still die in distress with uncontrolled symptoms, or have futile interventions when this will not make any difference. All of us, including doctors, must do more to talk about dying. A new ComRes research for the Dying Matters Coalition confirms there is a widespread reluctance to talk about dying and death. That is why we want to encourage people to talk more openly about dying and bereavement and to make plans around end-of-life care. Most people have not made a plan of their choices and wishes in the event of a serious illness. People often think there is plenty of time when the situation arises but often this is not the case and it can be too late. Doctors are trained to cure, but as people live with long-term conditions, the medical profession needs to change how it works with dying patients. We need to bring dying back into people's homes, rather than in hospital, care homes or hospices. As increasing numbers of people develop and live with dementia, it is vital that doctors talk about the kind of end-of-life care people would choose, while people are healthy. There's a huge change required in our culture, starting with the medical profession. Having learnt a lot from the Canadian communications expert Prof Stephen Workman, I would urge doctors to do three things. First, be compassionate but direct when talking about dying. Doctors speaking to relatives about an ill patient who is giving cause for concern, should not just say "your husband is seriously ill", but should add "It is possible that he could die". This allows all involved to prepare. Secondly, be honest and don't offer false hope. Think twice about offering a false choice of procedures like cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) when someone is actually dying and chances of recovery are minuscule. Instead offer supportive care to keep the patient comfortable and allow them to die a natural dignified death. And, thirdly, when doctors diagnose a serious illness they should ask the patient whether they would like to talk about what they can expect and what is likely to happen. Most people die from frailty in old age, and will be well known to health and social care services. Importantly, this gives opportunities for talking about end of life wishes and advance care planning. My ambition is to reduce the fear of dying and increase knowledge and awareness of palliative care. It is vitally important that every person who is coming to the end of their life is spotted early enough and supported to make a good advance care plan. I know just how hard it is to address issues like this in the frenzy of busy surgeries and wards. But we as doctors need to up our game. All of us, especially doctors can play a part in ensuring everyone is able to have a good death.	In this week's Scrubbing Up opinion column, Prof Mayur Lakhani chair of the Dying Matters Coalition, urges doctors to be more open and frank about preparing patients and their families for the end of life.
The Italy player had reportedly been linked to a reunion with ex-Juve manager Antonio Conte at Chelsea. The 29-year-old joined the Serie A champions from Bari in 2010 and has since made 291 appearances. In that time he has won five consecutive league titles, two Italian cups and reached the Champions League final in 2015.	Juventus defender Leonardo Bonucci has signed a contract extension that will keep him at the club until 2021.
The attacker, a 27-year-old Swiss man, also died on Sunday, they said. Five other people were hurt when the man set fire to the train and stabbed passengers in the attack on Saturday. Two of them, including a six-year-old child, are in a serious condition. Police have said that, as yet, there is no indication of a political or terrorist motive for the attack. The attack occurred around 14:20 (12:20 GMT) as the train was approaching Salez station, between the towns of Buchs and Sennwald. Several dozen passengers were on board at the time. In a statement (in German), St Gallen cantonal police said video evidence from inside the train showed the attacker, armed with a knife, pouring out a flammable liquid. Six people - including the attacker - were injured. The seventh injured person was a man on the platform who pulled the burning attacker off the train. Forensic experts are analysing the flammable liquid and the scene of the crime. Police said the attacker lived in a canton adjoining St Gallen. His address has been searched. On the basis of the video evidence, police say the man acted alone.	A 34-year-old woman who was injured in an attack by a knifeman on a Swiss train has died in hospital, police say.
An all-party group has called on the UK government to consider devolving some immigration control. That could involve Wales being able to set its own visas and migration quotas. And the group chairman said immigrants should have to learn English or Welsh. The UK government said different rules for different areas would cause difficulties for employers. Currently, there is no separate Welsh immigration policy. A number of recommendations have made by the All Party Parliamentary Group on Social Integration (APPGSI) report on how the UK's immigration system could promote better integration. It said speaking English was "the key to full participation in our society and economy". Group chairman Chuka Umunna MP said he wanted Wales to have a bigger say in developing immigration policies. "This is a really hot topic, it's become very toxic, very polarised and we want to build a consensus on what a new system could look like," he told BBC Radio Wales' Good Morning Wales programme. When asked if immigrants could learn Welsh if living and working in Wales as an alternative to English, he said: "Absolutely. Why not?", adding that people could not fully integrate in society if they could not speak the language. David Davies, Conservative MP for Monmouth, called it a "ludicrous idea". "People will just go to whichever nation... is offering the easiest visas and move to where they want to move to," he told BBC Wales. "Once they've got a visa to go to Wales there will be nothing to stop them going to England or vice versa." The MPs' report claims the UK's existing points-based immigration system is "generally unresponsive to demographic, economic and cultural differences between our constituent nations and regions". "Shaping immigration criteria to address nation or region-specific economic and cultural needs might instil confidence among members of the public that the immigration system works for their area", the study said. It added: "Enabling nations and regions to set regional immigration quotas would create new incentives for politicians to actively make the case for immigration in their area." Devolution could involve the introduction of region-specific visas, with quotas for how many are issued. Canada is given as an example, where all 10 provincial governments are allowed to set region-specific requirements for immigrants. Immigrants are required to live in the region that approves their visa until they become eligible to apply for Canadian citizenship. The province of Quebec is also able to set its own criteria for its visas and evaluate applications. A small element of regional policy on immigration already exists in the UK, where Scotland has a list of occupations in addition to a UK-wide version where employers can advertise outside of the EU without first advertising domestically. The UK government, the report said, should appoint an independent commission to explore how a devolved or regionally-led immigration system might work. Questions for the commission could include extending existing powers for Scotland to Wales, Northern Ireland, London and the English metro regions, and whether the UK government might copy the Quebec model. A Welsh Government spokesman said: "It is important that the needs of Wales are reflected in future migration policies and that people who settle here are supported to integrate into communities." Plaid Cymru external affairs spokesman Steffan Lewis said: "Plaid Cymru has long advocated a Welsh visa system to boost our public services such as the NHS and support the private sector in attracting high-skilled workers from around the world. "It is also of great regret that Westminster policies have damaged our reputation as a destination for international students. "Student visas should be devolved and would benefit our universities and our economy." A UK government spokeswoman said: "Applying different immigration rules to different parts of the United Kingdom will complicate the immigration system, harming its integrity and causing difficulties for employers who need the flexibility to deploy their staff to other parts of the UK." She said the UK government was rolling out a Â£20m fund for English language provision and had made Â£140m available to councils to manage impacts on communities "caused by issues such as poor English language skills". The spokeswoman added: "We must also recognise that uncontrolled, mass immigration makes it difficult to maintain social cohesion and puts pressure on public services. "Our priority is to build an immigration system that works for everyone in the UK and delivers the control we need."	Immigration rules tailored to the needs of Wales could build public confidence in the system, a group of MPs has said.
Scientists believe the drug, metformin, may mimic the effects of extreme calorie restriction. This regime, which is based on eating a very low calorie diet, is thought to promote healthy ageing. The human implications of the study are unclear, the researchers report in the journal, Nature Communications. Rafael de Cabo, of the National Institute on Ageing in Baltimore, Maryland, US, said calorie restriction in laboratory animals had been shown to increase their lifespan. His team is searching for interventions - such as a drug - that can mimic these effects. Metformin is one of the most widely prescribed treatments for type-2 diabetes, which occurs mainly in people above the age of 40. It is also used to treat metabolic syndrome, a combination of diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity. Previous work has shown that metformin can extend the lifespan of simple organisms such as worms, but studies in flies and mammals have given conflicting evidence. The scientists gave one of two different doses of metformin to middle-aged male mice and found that lower doses increased lifespan by about 5%, and also delayed the onset of age-associated diseases. But they said the higher dose of metformin was toxic and reduced the lifespan of mice. Further studies were needed to determine if metformin has any effect on human health and lifespan, said Dr de Cabo. "These are very promising results that need to be translated to humans via clinical studies," he said. He said the best current advice was to eat a good diet and exercise. "Right now the best that we can say is probably what your grandmother told you," he told BBC News. "Eat a good diet and exercise are the only two things that we know for sure that they work very well in humans." Prof Tom Kirkwood, associate dean for ageing at Newcastle University, said it is unclear what the study might mean for human health. "Metformin is a well-established drug that acts on metabolism and has long been used against type-2 diabetes," he said. "We've known for a long time that modulating metabolism in mice can extend survival and postpone age-related conditions, and there are sound reasons why this should be the case is a small, short-lived animal. "What we don't know however is whether similar effects on lifespan might be produced in humans. "This is something that we cannot simply take for granted and the study's authors do well to sound a note of caution."	A diabetes pill has anti-ageing effects and extends the life of male mice, research suggests.
The 32-year-old former Charlton, Fulham, Chelsea and Bristol Academy player has been with Yeovil since 2015. She netted seven goals in her first term for the Lady Glovers and a further seven in 2016 as Yeovil won WSL 2. "I am so happy to be given another opportunity with Yeovil to play in WSL 1," Heatherson told the club website.	Yeovil Town Ladies forward Annie Heatherson has signed a new contract with the Women's Super League One club ahead of the 2017 WSL 1 Spring Series.
Synchronised wreath-laying ceremonies will take place in counties Cork, Meath, Wexford, Galway and Dublin, beginning at 09:45 local time in Cork. Thousands of people lined the streets of Dublin on Sunday for a parade to mark the centenary. The commemoration events have been organised by the Irish government. The rebellion is viewed as a seminal event in the founding of the state. The Easter Rising was quelled within six days by British troops, but despite its failure it is seen as a significant stepping stone to the eventual creation of the Republic of Ireland and the partition of Ireland. More than 450 people were killed and 2,500 injured during the fighting. A weekend of events to mark the centenary of the Rising began on Saturday with a remembrance ceremony in Dublin at which Irish president Michael D Higgins laid a wreath. Wreaths were also laid in Dublin at Kilmainham Gaol, where 14 of the Rising's leaders were executed, and at the Sigerson Monument in Glasnevin Cemetery, which is dedicated to to all those who lost their lives in the Rising. The synchronised wreath-laying ceremonies on Monday have been organised by the Irish Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht (Irish-speaking areas). The locations and times are: Then, at 12:30 local time, wreaths will be laid at various buildings and landmarks around the Irish capital that became focal points during the rebellion. They include Boland's Mill, Jacob's Factory, Dublin Castle/City Hall, The Four Courts, Royal College of Surgeons and Moore Street.	The centenary of the Easter Rising, the rebellion that began on Easter Monday 1916, is to be marked in Irish towns and cities with wreath-laying events.
Ball, who featured against Pakistan A in Dubai, has taken six wickets in each of Notts' first two games and is the leading wicket-taker in Division One of the County Championship so far in 2016. Read said of the 25-year-old: "Last winter he got fitter and stronger. "Now he's genuinely lively and he does plenty with the new ball." Read said Ball's assured early showings have demanded he lead Notts' bowling attack with the new ball alongside England's Stuart Broad. "Jake is in fantastic form with the ball," continued Read. "He's had a great winter having been in Dubai with the Lions and has had a taste of what life is like with the ECB set-up. He's really keen to progress that side of his career." Notts director of cricket Mick Newell said Ball, who was their second-highest County Championship wicket taker with 39 last season, said he has been "terrific" so far in 2016. "That's a fantastic start to the season and he's setting a great example," added Newell. Despite Ball's efforts against Lancashire, Notts suffered an eight-wicket defeat in their second Country Championship match of the season on Wednesday, having beaten Surrey in their opening fixture.	Pace bowler Jake Ball has made a "lively" return following a winter playing for England Lions, says Nottinghamshire captain Chris Read.
The EU is expected to renew sanctions in a matter of weeks. Alexis Tsipras was speaking at a joint news conference in Athens with the Russian President Vladimir Putin. Mr Putin said there would be "no discussions" about Crimea, the Ukrainian peninsula that was seized by Kremlin-backed forces in 2014, leading to sanctions from the EU and US. The territory, which has an ethnic Russian majority, later voted to join Russia in a referendum that Ukraine and Western countries deem illegal. How Russia's relationship with Europe has evolved Mr Tsipras told reporters: "We have repeatedly said that the vicious circle of militarisation, of Cold War rhetoric and of sanctions is not productive. The solution is dialogue." Mr Putin said: "As far as Crimea is concerned, we consider this question is closed forever. Russia will not conduct any discussions with anyone on this subject." Mr Putin's visit to Greece is an attempt to reinforce a relationship with one of Russia's friends in Europe at a time when diplomatic tensions continue between Russia and the EU and US, the BBC's Thomas Fessy in Athens says. Mr Putin also said that Russia would be forced to respond to US moves in Europe, warning that Washington's missile shield bases in Romania and Poland were a direct threat to his country's security. "If yesterday in those areas of Romania people simply did not know what it means to be in the cross-hairs, then today we will be forced to carry out certain measures to ensure our security." Earlier this month, the US activated the anti-missile base in southern Romania. The base in Poland is expected to be operational in 2018. The US says its shield is to protect Nato countries from short- and medium-range missiles, particularly from the Middle East.	The Greek prime minister has said sanctions imposed on Russia over its actions in Ukraine are not productive.
According to parent company Liberty Global, Virgin Media originally said it had connected 465,000 new premises in the UK and Ireland in 2016. But following a review, that number has been revised down to 314,000. Liberty said Virgin had exaggerated how fast it could complete the connections. In a regulatory filing, the US company explained that - under Virgin's own reporting standards - the figures included premises where installation work was "essentially complete" but not actually finished. That included 142,000 sites that had been expected to be connected during the first three months of 2017. However, Liberty said that in late February 2017, it had discovered that "the construction work necessary to connect a substantial number of [these premises] had not progressed as originally understood". This prompted it to carry out a review, in which it found "the completion status" of some premises had been "misrepresented". Liberty also said Virgin Media had "inadvertently" classified a further 9,000 unfinished premises as connected, when they had not been. Dan Howdle, a consumer telecoms analyst at Cable.co.uk, told the BBC: "Clearly the way in which the numbers had been reported failed to preclude the possibility of jumping the gun, though there is no evidence an intent to mislead lay behind it." He added: "Virgin Media appears to be dealing with the issue decisively, though mistakes resulting in stories of this nature are unlikely to leave a brand completely unscathed." Four Virgin Media employees have been suspended in connection with Liberty's investigation and could face disciplinary action "including dismissal". The company said the setback would affect the total number of premises Virgin Media connected during the first half of 2017. However, it said it had taken steps to speed up Project Lightning, including appointing a new managing director, Robert Evans, to lead the scheme. It also said Virgin would no longer include uncompleted connections in its figures. Launched in 2015, Virgin's Project Lightning is designed to connect about four million more UK homes and businesses to broadband speeds of 300Mbs. By the end of December it had reached 567,000 premises in total - down from the 718,000 previously reported.	Virgin Media has suspended four members of staff and begun an investigation after it admitted overstating the expansion of its superfast broadband network, dubbed Project Lightning.
Dr Helen Nicoll, 53, was found dead at home in Frog End, Great Wilbraham, Cambridgeshire, on Friday. Her husband and partner in their dental practice, Stephen Nicoll, 53, was arrested on suspicion of murder before being released on Tuesday. A post-mortem examination revealed Mrs Nicoll died from asphyxiation. Mr Nicoll was released by police with no further action and his bail cancelled. The couple had three children and worked together in their clinic in Hurst Park, Cambridge while Mr Nicoll also practises in London's Harley Street. Mr Nicoll said in a statement: "These last few days have been the worst of my life. "Nobody can understand the true loss that my children and I have experienced following the discovery that my wife Helen has taken her own life. "I would ask everybody, particularly the media, to respect our privacy and allow us to come to terms with our devastating loss and to begin the grieving process as a family following this tragedy." He added his family had "fully co-operated" with police and his wife's death had been referred to the coroner. Mr Nicoll's solicitor Paul Oliver said: "The arrest of Mr Nicoll in the immediate aftermath of the death of his beloved wife and the consequential media interest in this tragic case compounded the distress caused to him and his family. "The police have confirmed Mr Nicoll is not a suspect and he and his family now ask that their right to grieve in private be respected."	The husband of a dentist who was arrested over her death has said she "took her own life" as he told of his family's "devastating loss".
Santa Cruz's WBA Super World featherweight title will be on the line at the Barclays Centre in Brooklyn. Frampton is aiming to become the first Northern Ireland boxer to win world titles at different weights. The Belfast man has had to relinquish his IBF world super bantamweight belt ahead of his featherweight title bid. In February, Frampton beat Scott Quigg in a super-bantamweight unification bout. It saw the 29-year-old add the WBA belt to the IBF title he already held, but he has now vacated both crowns in order to challenge Santa Cruz in the higher weight division. He was stripped of the WBA crown because he did not agree to a defence against mandatory challenger Guillermo Rigondeaux. On the same night as the Frampton v Quigg clash in Manchester, Santa Cruz defended his WBA featherweight title against Spain's Kiko Martinez. Mexican Santa Cruz, 27, is a three-weight world champion and is undefeated in his 33 professional contests. "This is the fight I wanted - me and my team have been chasing it for a long, long time," said Frampton on his decision to move up a weight. "I'm 100% confident that the belt will be coming home to Belfast. It is the one my manager Barry McGuigan held 30 years ago. "Santa Cruz is a strong and aggressive undefeated champion but his style is made for me. "We know we have the tools to beat Leo. He throws a lot shots and is a proven operator. It is going to be a great fight. "I would like to say a huge thank you to the IBF for their professionalism during my time as their super bantamweight champion. "I have been a proud IBF World champion for nearly two years and I one day hope to once again become an IBF champion."	Carl Frampton's world featherweight title bout with defending champion Leo Santa Cruz will take place on 30 July in New York.
Detentions by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency jumped to 41,318 between January 22 of this year and the end of April. That was up from 30,028 arrests in about the same period last year. The dragnet follows presidential orders widening the scope of who can be targeted for immigration violations. Almost two-thirds of those arrested this year had criminal convictions, said ICE. But more than half the increase in arrests was of immigrants who had committed no crime other than being in the US without permission. President Donald Trump has stepped up immigration enforcement to target such undocumented immigrants. Acting director of ICE Thomas Homan said on a call on Wednesday with reporters that immigrants who pose a threat to national security or have criminal records are still a priority for his agency. But he added: "There is no category of aliens off the table." ICE will continue to target people who have been issued a final order of removal by an immigration judge, even if they have not committed another crime, he vowed. "Those that enter the country illegally, they do violate the law, that is a criminal act," acting director of ICE Thomas Homan said on the call. "When a federal judge makes a decision and issues an order that order needs to mean something," Mr Homan said. President Barack Obama was also criticised for deporting a large number of immigrants, but most of them were recent illegal border crossers. President Trump's signature campaign pledge to build an expanded wall on the US-Mexico border is in limbo after Congress denied funding for it in a recent budget deal. But his tough rhetoric on border security appears to be having an impact on immigration enforcement. The number of people caught crossing the border with Mexico is down significantly since the beginning of the year, according US Customs and Border Protection data. Immigration advocates have raised concerns about the stepped up enforcement in the interior of the country.	US arrests of suspected illegal immigrants rose by 38% in the first 100 days of Donald Trump's presidency, according to government data.
Drones: What are they and how do they work? Could we all soon own a drone? Viewpoint: Drones, modern war, and the US The matte black, almost featureless triangular aircraft is making its first public appearance, and the makers don't want people seeing too much of its advanced features. But this object - the rather awkwardly-named nEUROn - could be the future of combat aircraft. When a jet like the Rafale or the Sukhoi SU-35 shrieks overhead at the show, the watching crowds are left in awe at the skill and daring of the pilot. Ever since the World War I, when aces like the Red Baron Manfred von Richthofen patrolled the skies, the fighter pilot has held a special place in the imagination. But that status could now be under threat, because the next generation of combat aircraft may dispense with the pilot altogether. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, or drones, are nothing new, as their controversial use in Afghanistan and Pakistan has shown. But drones have limitations, and are vulnerable to being shot down within seconds of going anywhere near properly defended airspace. One solution is to develop much larger machines, full-scale fighter aircraft capable of flying long distances at high speed. They would be capable of bombing missions or tactical strikes, and able to defend themselves. And all without the need for a pilot. A number of experimental "superdrones" have already been built. Among them are Northrop Grumman's X-47 and the BAE Systems' Taranis. And then there's the spooky-looking nEUROn, being developed by a European consortium. France's Dassault is the lead contractor in the six-nation consortium, with the other participants being defence companies from Greece, Italy, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland. The nEUROn, which made its first flight at the tail end of last year, is an ugly beast, low slung and black. Its rather bat-like appearance clearly owes a great deal to the Lockheed Martin F117 Nighthawk, better known as the original Stealth Fighter, and indeed it has been built using stealth technologies. "It's a big one!" says Eric Trappier, chief executive of French firm Dassault Aviation. "It's the size of a fighter, with a bomb bay." The aircraft has already done radar tests to assess its stealth capabilities, but a fully operational aircraft is unlikely to be ready until the end of the decade. Mr Trappier believes there is a clear role for unmanned aircraft to play in future conflicts, with fleets of pilotless planes being directed to targets by controllers on the ground, or from manned aircraft flying behind them. "In some regions you have very dangerous missions, and the use of unmanned vehicles could be very useful. For example, the destruction of enemy countermeasures or missiles or whatever. "It's mainly for the first day of war, where you don't really know what's going on in front of you, the UCAV (unmanned combat aerial vehicle) could be a good answer." So could unmanned planes one day do the job better than a fighter piloted by an individual rather than a computer? "Yes, in some types of mission it could be better. In some others, where you really need to have the pilot in the loop, well I think the manned vehicle will remain. So it's a kind of compromise between the unmanned vehicles and the manned fighters." But manufacturers wont be able to develop them without opposition.

Bruce Dickinson's airline ambitions Budget long-haul flights 'can work' A350: The plane Airbus did not want to build Full coverage: Aerospace industry The use of existing drones has faced widespread criticism, largely because of the way in which they have been employed by the CIA in particular, outside the boundaries of conventional conflict. But there have also been concerns that the operators of drones are too far removed from the battlefield to comprehend the seriousness of what they do and that mistakes can be made. But according to Mr Trappier, the issue is not whether or not drones should be used, but how they should be operated. "It's a matter of who is in charge, who is in command. You need to know what you are doing on the mission. Whether a human is in the aircraft or not, he has to be in the loop." He says much of the criticism in the US is not about the use of drones, but about who is in charge: the CIA, the Pentagon, or the armed forces. "You need to continue to operate UAVs as though you were operating a manned vehicle," he says. That's fine in theory, but would it be the case in practice? Given the amount of development money being poured into this industry, one suspects that in a few years time we will eventually find out.	Under a huge semi-opaque dome and with heavy security in attendance, visitors to the Paris Air Show peer  at a strange looking shape.
Sexist, racist and homophobic remarks were being used by pupils against school staff, as well as offensive comments about appearance, the NASUWT said. There were also examples of parents being abusive on social media, it added. About 60% of 1,500 teachers questioned in a poll said they had faced abuse, compared with 21% last year. In one case, a photograph of a teacher was posted online with an insulting word underneath. In another, pupils used the name of a heavily pregnant school worker to post insults, the teachers' union said. Of those who had been subjected to insults, nearly half (48%) said these remarks were posted by pupils, 40% said they were put up by parents, and 12% said both parents and pupils were responsible. Almost two-thirds (62%) said pupils had posted insulting comments, while just over a third (34%) said students had taken photos or videos without consent. A third (33%) received remarks about their performance as a teacher, 9% had faced allegations from pupils about inappropriate behaviour and 8% had been subjected to threatening behaviour. More than half (57%) of pupils responsible were aged between 14 and 16, and 38% were 11 to 14, the teachers' poll found, with a fifth aged 16 to 19 and 5% were seven to 11. Among the examples published by NASUWT was the case of a student uploading a teacher's photo and then, along with classmates, writing insults underneath. One teacher had been harassed for nine months by students who sent sexually explicit messages and set up a fake social media account in the teacher's name. The union said it had been told of a teacher receiving the comment "I hope she gets cancer", while the heavily pregnant worker had faced abusive remarks. Another school worker faced comments from a pupil's family member about how they looked and that they were ugly. Chris Keates, the union's general secretary, said: "It is deeply worrying to see that the abuse of teachers has risen by such a huge margin this year. "Equally concerning is that it appears that more parents are the perpetrators of the abuse. "The vile, insulting and personal comments are taking their toll on teachers' health and well-being, and undermining their confidence to do their job."	More teachers are facing abuse on social media, warns a teachers' union.
Roger Hayes, 75, from Holsworthy, Devon and son Andy, 39, from Birmingham, died when their twin-seat plane crashed at Pierre-Buffiere on 29 June, 2012. The plane crashed 20 minutes after taking off from nearby Limoges as they flew to the south of France. The coroner, Elizabeth Earland, recorded a verdict of accidental death. Andrew Cope, a senior Air Accident Investigation Board inspector, said an iPad navigation app may have prompted the pilot to make a sharp turn. Mr Cope told the inquest: "I think the pilot, Andrew, probably realised he was in restricted air space and turned around. "That's the point where things start to go awry and the flight path is quite dramatic from then on. "The pilot has now realised he is descending and is manoeuvring the aircraft to get back up. "The problem is that if that is done very quickly it puts a lot of pressure on the wings." Mr Cope agreed with the findings of French investigators who said the wings probably broke off when they came under too much pressure as Mr Hayes attempted to right the aircraft. Didier Pauliet, who works at a nearby school, said: "The aircraft started losing bits. A wing fell off violently. "Other bits, some bigger, started falling off. "The rest of the plane fell in one piece almost immediately. We could see a lot of smoke." The inquest heard the single-engine Jabiru 450 had been heading to the southern French town of Rodez when it crashed into woodland. Officials said the plane stopped off in Cherbourg on the French Channel coast, then at Le Mans, north west France, before refuelling in Limoges about 100 miles from Rodez.	An aircraft which crashed in France killing a father and son fell from the sky "like a stone" when its wings failed, an inquest has heard.
In the footage, some Kenyan soldiers can be seen carrying white shopping bags, while others appear to take white boxes from a mobile phone store. At least 67 people died when suspected al-Shabab militants stormed the Nairobi shopping centre on 21 September. The Kenyan military says it is investigating the looting allegations. News agencies say the CCTV footage is taken inside the entrance to the Westgate mall's Nakumatt supermarket, which sells everything from food to televisions. In one section of footage, several soldiers are seen walking out of the supermarket, past a blood-spattered floor, carrying plastic carrier bags. In another clip, Kenyan soldiers can be seen next to a mobile phone outlet. Heroes of attack Victims of attack One reaches over the counter, and apparently removes a white item. Then more soldiers remove white items, which the Reuters news agency describes as mobile phone boxes. The Westgate attack sparked a four-day siege in which large parts of the shopping centre were destroyed. The Kenyan military says it has launched an investigation into the looting allegations, which correspondents say will have angered many Kenyans. At the weekend, Kenya's biggest-selling newspaper, The Nation, ran an article entitled "Shame of soldiers looting Westgate". The footage of the alleged looting emerged as the Kenyan authorities announced they had recovered the body of what they consider to be a fourth attacker. "Today, Sunday 20 October 2013, we recovered a fourth body, which we know from CCTV footage to be that of a terrorist," said the Kenyan interior minister, Joseph Ole Lenku. "DNA and other investigations will confirm their identities. We have also recovered four AK47 assault rifles which we know were used by the terrorists in the assault. We also recovered 11 magazines of AK47 assault rifles." Officials had initially said 10 to 15 gunmen were involved, but CCTV footage appears to show only four militants. It is still not clear whether some of the attackers might have escaped. The Somali militant group al-Shabab said its members staged the attack in response to Kenya's army carrying out operations on Somali territory. Last week, the BBC's Newsnight programme revealed that one of the suspected attackers was believed to be a 23-year-old Somalia-born Norwegian national, Hassan Abdi Dhuhulow. His family fled to Norway in the 1990s, but he returned to Somalia in 2009 and allegedly joined the Somali militant group. Sources in al-Shabab have told the BBC Somali Service that Dhuhulow attended a training camp in El Bur in central Somalia, one of the militants' main bases. The sources said Dhuhulow took part in many al-Shabab operations in Mogadishu and Kismayo and was well-known in jihadist circles.	Security camera footage has emerged which appears to show Kenyan security forces looting goods during last month's siege of the Westgate mall.
The track broke streaming records, earning the highest first-week streams for a single in the UK with more than 2.03 million plays. Drag Me Down is One Direction's first single as a foursome since band mate Zayn Malik left and has had more than 17.7 million streams to date globally. The band shot the video for 'Drag Me Down' at NASA's headquarters in Houston yesterday. According to the Official Charts Company, Calvin Harris and Disciples' How Deep Is Your Love climbed from six to two and last week's number one, Black Magic by Little Mix, fell to three. The top five was rounded off with Lost Frequencies' Are You With Me at four, and Years & Years' Shine at five.	One Direction have topped the UK singles chart with their new single Drag Me Down.
Mae grŵp wedi'i sefydlu yn Arberth, Sir Benfro sy'n helpu i ddod â theulu o ffoaduriaid i'r DU a chynnig cartref iddyn nhw. Mae Arberth yn un o 10 tref yn y DU sydd wedi ymgymryd â chynllun gan Lywodraeth y DU yn 2016 i gymryd cyfrifoldeb o gefnogi cartrefu ffoaduriaid. Dywedodd un sy'n aelod o Croeso Arberth, Christina Hughes, wrth raglen Eye on Wales ar BBC Radio Wales nad oedd hi'n gallu "eistedd nôl a gwylio pobl yn dioddef". Felly daeth criw o bobl leol at ei gilydd i sefydlu'r grŵp, sy'n cymryd cyfrifoldeb o hyd at dri theulu drwy ddarparu cartref ar eu cyfer a'u helpu i ddysgu Saesneg er mwyn dod o hyd i waith. Mae ffigyrau yn dangos bod grwpiau cymunedol o'r fath wedi cefnogi hyd at 53 ffoadur y llynedd. Ond mae Croeso Arberth yn pryderu bod y broses yn un cymhleth. Roedd yn rhaid iddyn nhw gasglu £4,500 ar gyfer yswiriant ar gyfer y saith ffoadur maen nhw'n eu cefnogi, yn ogystal â chadw £6,000 mewn cyfrif i dalu am gyfieithwyr a chostau teithio. Mae £200 yn cael ei gadw 'nôl hefyd fel lwfans i aelodau o'r teulu. "Dyma oedd dechrau'r broses gyda nifer o ffurflenni gan y Swyddfa Gartref i'w llenwi," meddai Ms Hughes. "Doedd gennai ddim syniad faint o waith oedd yn ei gymryd. Hanner ffordd drwy'r broses roeddwn yn gofyn i fy hun 'be dwi'n ei wneud?' "Ond dwi'n falch fy mod wedi bwrw 'mlaen."

Bellach mae'r broses ar ben ac mae teulu o saith ffoadur o Syria wedi cyrraedd Arberth. "Allai ddim credu bod y cyfan drosodd," meddai Ms Hughes. "Gan ein bod yn un o'r grwpiau cyntaf i gyflawni hyn dwi'n gobeithio wrth fynd ymlaen bydd y Swyddfa Gartref yn gwneud pethau'n gynt i grwpiau eraill."

Deputy Foreign Minister Faisal al-Mekdad told the BBC "Syria is doing its best" to comply with the timetable to destroy its chemical weapons. Syria missed Wednesday's deadline to hand over its entire stockpile. Mr Mekdad said a shipment of weapons came under attack twice on its way from Damascus to the port of Latakia. "We shipped two shipments to the Syrian coast," he said. "The second shipment was intercepted by fire from terrorist groups." He added: "This is a serious business. Syria is in war, and the Americans and others have to take this into consideration." He described as "absolutely unacceptable" US Secretary of State John Kerry's recent condemnation of the government's use of barrel bombs in the city of Aleppo. The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights claims 246 people, including 73 children, have been killed in Aleppo in the last five days alone after barrels containing explosives and metal fragments were dropped by military helicopters. Activist group The Aleppo Media Centre claims 14 people were killed in barrel bomb attacks on the Masaken Hanano district on Thursday, citing footage appearing to show bombs being dropped from a helicopter onto a civilian area. "We are defending our people against terrorist attacks. We have never bombarded places with civilians," Mr Mekdad insisted, accusing the US of "still supporting terrorist elements" in the country. The Syrian government, via state media, also denied reports that rebels had seized most of Aleppo's central prison. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said members of the Islamic Front coalition, dominated by the Ahrar al-Sham brigade and the al-Qaeda affiliate al-Nusra Front, mounted the assault, freeing hundreds of detainees. But state television insisted soldiers and security forces had "thwarted an attack against the prison by terrorist groups". The Observatory says fighting is still going on, but the Ahrar al-Sham brigade and the Aleppo Media Centre, a citizen-journalist outlet, say rebels now completely control the prison. It is reported to hold at least 3,000 detainees, including Islamists, activists and minors, in horrific conditions. Syria has about 1,300 tonnes of declared chemical weapons. The US said last week that so far only about 4% of the stockpile - 30 tonnes - had left the country. US Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel said he was "concerned" that the UN-backed plan was falling behind schedule and said Damascus "had to take responsibility for fulfilling its commitment". Russia - a key ally of Syria - has said Damascus should complete the transfer of its chemical weapons to the coast for removal by ship by 1 March. A deadline was set last year for all the weapons to be destroyed by the end of June. The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), which is overseeing the destruction operation, has admitted the process has been slowed down by security concerns. Mr Mekdad stressed: "Syria is committed to all its agreements, with the OPCW and the UN Security Council. We shall implement on time all our obligations."	Syria says international accusations that it is delaying the destruction of its chemical weapons stockpile are "absolutely unjustified".
Conrad Clitheroe and Gary Cooper, both from Stockport, and expat Neil Munro were reportedly taking notes near Fujairah Airport, 80 miles from Dubai, when they were arrested in February. Relatives were told they were held for "national security" reasons. The men insisted they did not take photographs. The Abu Dhabi hearing is due on Monday. Mr Clitheroe, 54, and Mr Cooper 45, were visiting their friend Mr Munro, who was born in Manchester, when they were arrested on 22 February by an off-duty police officer who had seen them monitoring planes from a car. They were near Fujairah Airport, where older and rarer aircraft can be seen. A local police official said the men had been taking photographs near an airport and were using a telescope. The men are expected to argue their actions were misinterpreted and are understood to be hoping to be granted bail.	A court hearing for British plane spotters held over allegations of suspicious behaviour in the United Arab Emirates has been postponed for a week.
"What time does your website close?" in Poole and "Can I exercise my kestrel on your tip?" in Nottingham are among the top ten bizarre calls of the last year. Three of ten were made in Somerset, including: "What are the rules and regulations for hosting a mouse race?" Councils are people's "first port of call" whatever the query, says the LGA. The Local Government Association said councils' customer service hubs in England and Wales handled more than 50 million calls a year - the bulk of which are about council tax and parking. But it compiled its top ten of the "slightly amusing to the outright bizarre" queries received in the past 12 months. Peter Fleming, of the LGA, said: "These light-hearted examples of calls highlight the variety of issues that councils deal with every day."	Questions on everything from James Bond villains to Great British Bake Off cake tins have been received by council call centres in England.
The Perth club has suspended the team-mates pending a club investigation. Wright told BBC Scotland that "if what's alleged" to have occurred did in fact happen "we'll come down severely hard on both". Referee Don Robertson sent off both players during the break. Wright, whose side confirmed their top six place due to results elsewhere, says he did not see the incident as he had already started walking up the tunnel following the half time whistle. BBC Scotland reporter Jonathan Sutherland saw Foster throw a punch at Swanson, who retaliated by aiming a kick at the defender after he had slipped. "I haven't seen it with my own eyes but obviously something happened," said Wright. "I'm going to wait and see for myself. The players have been told they let themselves down, and let the team down. We should be celebrating confirming our top six place tonight. "Under no circumstance will they get off lightly if what is alleged to have happened has happened. The hardest punishment I can do legally with them, I'll do it." Media playback is not supported on this device Wright was angry that the incident left his side up against it in the second half, and that the shine was taken off the Saints confirming a top six berth. "It's another great achievement getting the top six," he added. "We showed a lot of character and should have had a penalty. (Georgios) Sarris has got arms all over Murray Davidson and that should have been a penalty kick. "The boys were magnificent and probably deserved a point but they didn't get it." Hamilton player Ali Crawford was shown a yellow card and assistant manager Guillaume Beuzelin sent to the stand after becoming involved in the chaotic scenes that followed the incident between Foster and Swanson. However, manager Martin Canning told BBC Scotland: "I would rather be talking about us. It is not something you want to see, but it is a passionate game and sometimes it spills over. "My players acted well. I think Darian MacKinnon was just trying to separate them and calm things down. "I don't think I have to take any action against my players." Hamilton moved off bottom spot in the table thanks to the win, sealed by a late Alex D'Acol goal. They are 11th on 27 points, two clear of bottom club Inverness Caledonian Thistle. "With 11 against 11 in the first half, I thought we were excellent and we kept going and got a huge three points," Canning added.	St Johnstone players Danny Swanson and Richard Foster are set to face "severe" punishments for brawling with each other in the 1-0 defeat at Hamilton, manager Tommy Wright says.
The 50p per unit minimum was approved by MSPs in 2012, but has faced legal challenges from the drinks industry. The committee on the Licensing Act 2003 also called for an overhaul of local licensing panels after hearing of "scandalous misuse" of powers. Chair Baroness McIntosh of Pickering called the act "fundamentally flawed". The Lords Select Committee said that if minimum pricing was shown to cut down on excessive drinking, it needed to be adopted nationwide. But while the government waited for legal challenges to conclude, there were other areas of the act that could be addressed, such as abolishing local authority licensing committees and giving the powers to planning committees. "The [Lords select] committee was shocked by some of the evidence it received on hearings before licensing committees," said Baroness McIntosh. "Their decisions have been described as 'something of a lottery', 'lacking formality', and 'indifferent', with some 'scandalous misuses of the powers of elected local councillors'." Derbyshire Police told peers that the system had become "too political", with councils "frightened of making a tough decision" in case of appeals by big drinks companies. But a spokesman for licensing at the Local Government Association said scrapping the panels would be "unnecessary and ill-advised". Chris Pillai added: "Figures from 2016 show that of the more than 21,000 licence applications made to council licensing committees, less than 1% were challenged. "This reflects the fairness and sound basis licensing committees are using to make their decisions." He agreed with the peers that planning and licensing could work more closely within local authorities, but said the proposed changes would "not tackle current flaws in the Licensing Act" and failed to take into account pressures on the planning system. The select committee's report also warned that the act was not working in regulating late night openings. "Pubs, clubs and live music venues are a vital part of our cultural identity," added Baroness McIntosh. "Any decline in our cities' world-famous nightlife ought to be prevented and the businesses supported. "But the night time economy needs regulating; even in these areas of cities, residents have their rights. The current systems are not being used because they do not work." The report also called for the act to be implemented at airports and for establishments to provide a disabled access statement when applying for a licence.	Minimum unit pricing for alcohol should be rolled out across the UK if Scotland's scheme is successful, a Lords committee says.
The nine-year-old's family sought redress from NHS England and South Central Ambulance Service after he became unwell in 2007 aged six weeks. He received treatment at the Royal Berkshire Hospital, but it came too late to prevent injury to his brain. The organisations denied liability, but agreed to settle the case. The High Court heard that the child, who is from Berkshire but who cannot be identified, requires around-the-clock care. He has severe cerebral palsy, profound learning disabilities, deafness, severe visual impairment and epilepsy. His legal team alleged his condition was the result of negligence by two GPs and a paramedic. They argued the boy would not have suffered the injuries if he had been given antibiotics and hospital treatment sooner. Mr Justice Kerr said the payout, which will be used to provide the boy with life-long care, "marks the end of a long and difficult process". He will receive a £2.3m lump sum and index-linked annual payments of £237,660 which will increase to £259,257 when he turns 19. Speaking after the hearing, the family's solicitor, Olivia Scates, described the case as "extremely tragic and distressing". "His family have been devastated," she said. "I am delighted the family will now have access to the help they need to provide for his extremely severe disabilities."	A boy who suffered "catastrophic brain damage" after contracting meningitis as a baby is to receive £4.6m in compensation from the NHS.
Chisako Kakehi was arrested in 2014 and went on trial in Kyoto late last month. Her lawyers have pleaded not guilty on her behalf, and when her trial began she said only that she would "leave everything" to her defence team. But in court, asked if she killed her husband, she said there was "no mistake", the Mainichi reported. The 70-year-old said she committed the crime because her husband was not treating her well financially, and that she obtained the cyanide from a business associate. "I wasn't given any money after I married him," the Japan Times quoted Ms Kakehi as telling the court on Monday. "I have no intention of hiding the guilt. I will laugh it off and die if I am sentenced to death tomorrow." Prosecutors say Ms Kakehi targeted the men for their money and poisoned them all with cyanide. The investigation began when Isao Kakehi, her fourth husband who she reportedly met via a match-making site, died on 28 December 2013, a month after they got married. A post mortem examination subsequently found traces of cyanide in his body, and investigators then began examining the deaths of other men linked to the pensioner. She is now on trial for murdering him and two other boyfriends, and the attempted murder and robbery of another boyfriend who later died of cancer. The men were all aged between 70 and 80 when the alleged crimes took place between 2007-2013. Ms Kakehi's three other husbands also all died, but she has not been charged in connection with their deaths. Lawyers for Ms Kakehi say her testimony cannot be trusted, because she has mild dementia. "Since she is suffering from dementia, she barely remembers things that happened recently let alone the incidents," her team was quoted as saying at the start of the trial, which is expected to continue until November. Japanese press have dubbed Ms Kakehi a "black widow" - a term derived from the female spider that eats its partner after mating. In April another Japanese woman, Kanae Kajima, who was convicted of killing three lovers, lost a final appeal against her death sentence at the Supreme Court.	A Japanese pensioner accused of killing three partners and attempting to murder a fourth has told a court that she fatally poisoned her husband.
But the scandal rocking Germany's political establishment isn't about sleaze or corruption but rather whether a little-known website can publish documents already publicly discussed. What started off as an obscure case has turned into a fiery national debate about the freedom of the press and the influence of government ministers over the courts. Earlier this year, Andre Meister and Markus Beckedahl published classified documents on the digital rights website Netzpolitik, indicating that Germany's intelligence service was planning to expand online surveillance to combat terrorism, and that a special unit could be set up to monitor social media. Last week the journalists announced that they were being investigated for treason. If the state prosecutor had his way, wrote Andre Meister on Netzpolitik: "Markus and I will soon be sitting in jail for two years." There was a national outcry. Headlines screamed that freedom of the press was under attack and thousands took to the streets of Berlin in support of Netzpolitik. In Britain, headlines are made when parliamentary officials are caught, quite literally, with their pants down - ideally, for maximum effect, with the involvement of drugs and prostitutes. In Germany it is data protection that gets people worked up. That seems less surprising when you remember Germany's painful experience of totalitarianism during the 20th Century. Hitler's secret police, the Gestapo, and communist East Germany's Stasi agents spied extensively on their own citizens and severely controlled the press. So privacy rights and the role of the media are not simply matters of academic debate. People here are all too aware of the dangers when a state gets too powerful. This historical legacy helps explain why the allegations of American spying in Germany have caused such uproar. And why Edward Snowden, who leaked the information of American spying activities, is viewed as something approaching a national hero here, particularly by left-wing Germans - many of whom are possibly unaware of Mr Snowden's own right-wing views when it comes to the role of the state and social welfare. The treason investigation into the journalists at Netzpolitik has been so controversial that it was only a matter of time before heads started to roll. Within days government leaders, including the interior minister, the minister of justice and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, all publicly withdrew their support for the chief prosecutor Harald Range, who had launched the investigation. And on Tuesday it was announced that Mr Range would be dismissed - the first time that a German government has fired a chief prosecutor. But the scandal is far from over. Opposition politicians are calling for a full inquiry into why the justice minister and the interior minister let the journalists be investigated for treason in the first place. And Mr Meister and Mr Beckedahl are demanding answers over whether they have been spied on by the authorities. "For us, as journalists, who believe in the rule of law, it feels like we've landed in a nightmare, in a repressive state, in which it's possible to spy on investigative journalists," Mr Beckedahl told German television station ARD. "I could never have imagined that." The treason investigation has now been suspended. But chief prosecutor Range has accused the government of interfering in legal proceedings. It was not acceptable, he said, for politicians "to influence an investigation because its possible findings may not be politically expedient". Instead of clarifying the situation of what journalists can and can't publish, the case appears to be throwing up even more questions. What is a state secret? What is a journalist allowed to publish? And in the days of online media and social media, what is the definition of a journalist anyway? The fact that the investigation was launched, and then stopped when things got sticky politically, hasn't solved any of these issues - meaning, warn critics, that it's only a matter of time before another similar scandal blows up.	Journalists have been accused of treason; a chief prosecutor fired; and we have witnessed the unedifying spectacle of government ministers scrambling to get out of the firing line after popular outrage.
Lancashire's loss to Warwickshire meant Hampshire needed to win to survive. They declared on 245-9 to leave Durham 296 from a minimum of 78 overs for victory, which they reached to end the hosts' two-year stay in the top tier. Mark Stoneman (137) and Scott Borthwick (88) excelled in their last innings for Durham before they join Surrey in 2017. England all-rounder Ben Stokes (23 not out) struck the winning runs for the visitors. Hampshire had opted to bat on during the morning session to extend their lead close to 300 and, with Lancashire struggling at Edgbaston, it soon became clear that only a win would be enough for survival. Ryan Pringle's 7-107 indicated that Hampshire's spinners would be their best hope of success, but a second-wicket stand of 162 between Stoneman and Borthwick ended their chances of achieving safety.	Hampshire were relegated from County Championship Division One after suffering a six-wicket home defeat by Durham in the season's final game.
Australian businessman David Prior said he hoped to double production at Bladnoch Distillery, near Wigtown. The single malt will be relaunched and he also has plans to introduce a new blend called Pure Scot. Mr Prior said it would be aimed at a new generation of whisky drinkers in his homeland and hoped it would have a considerable local economic impact. "I think there's some great things happening in other parts of the world with whisky - but it has got a long way to go to catch up with Scotch," he said. "So I wanted to invest in that, I wanted to be part of that. "I didn't want to try doing it back home or some other market, I wanted to do it here." He said it was "very exciting" to have Bladnoch in his "stable of businesses". "I suppose our vision is to see this as a very, very vibrant and big, functioning distillery creating a lot of employment for this region and to be the cornerstone of this community," he said.

Flint Community Hospital could be closed under plans by Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board (BCUHB) to reorganise its services in north Wales. Campaigners joined a protest march from the hospital to attend the public meeting at the town hall. In a statement BCUHB said retaining the status quo was "not an option". The health board, which predicts a financial shortfall of Â£64.6m this year, revealed details of its proposed shake-up in July. Under plans being considered Blaenau Ffestiniog community hospital could also close and minor injury accident departments may shut at other locations. Neo-natal intensive care may also be transferred over the border to England as part of the proposed shake-up. Shortly after the plans were made public GPs in the area revealed their concerns about the effects of proposed cuts on community services. Mark Scriven, the health board's medical director, said there was sound reasoning behind the proposals to close Flint hospital. "The thinking generally about the problems we're trying to address in these proposals with community hospitals is that some of them are very old, and they have poor fabric," he told BBC Radio Wales. He said it was not just the furnishings that were not up to scratch, the physical space did not suit modern health care. "A lot of them, and the services they provide, are underused, and certainly the minor injuries unit at Flint hospital is underused, which is important because it doesn't allow the nurses running it to maintain their experience according to their professional bodies," added Mr Scriven. In response, Jack Reece, chairman of the Save Our Cottage Hospital Campaign, said Flint hospital was well used. Speaking at Tuesday protest, he added: "They've closed us, they took beds away from us. We've had 18 going down to 14, going down to 12, 10. "They're taking away our clinics from there. They have systematically dropped the services from this town." Mr Reece described BCUHB's plans as a new version of old proposals by the Flintshire Health Board which had already been rejected by the Welsh government. Explaining the reasons behind its proposed shake-up, BCUHB said it was clear that it could not afford to stand still. "The status quo is not an option," the board said. "The proposals we are now making are intended to change the way in which services are provided and where they are provided to ensure patient safety and meet quality standards. "The proposals will allow us to attract and retain the professional clinical staff we need and control our costs when public finances are decreasing." BCUHB said its consultation exercise would run until 28 October, and it would also take account of the views of the community health council and any views they have heard from the public before making decisions. Any changes would start in early 2013, it said.	More than 1,000 campaigners trying to save a north Wales community hospital from closure have marched to a health board consultation meeting.
The 35-year-old wing has signed for the Mitsubishi Dynaboars in Division Two of the Japanese League on a one-year deal. Williams scored twice in his final competitive game as Ospreys . "It was a last-minute offer that I had to give great thought to in a short space of time," Williams told Twitter. "Really looking forward to this exciting venture." Williams announced his  in February after he turned down Ospreys' offer to extend his playing career with the Welsh region to a 10th season. The 2008 International Rugby Board player of the year  in December, with 58 tries in 87 games for his country and two in four Tests for the British and Irish Lions. Williams signed off from the international stage in typical fashion, scoring a last-gasp try in the  in Cardiff on 3 December. The double-Grand Slam winner was also Ospreys' record try-scorer, with 57 touchdowns in 141 matches, and scored late on in his last game for both club and country. But Williams' final appearance in Europe was for the Barbarians in their  in Cardiff on 2 June. He was expected to continue his association with the Ospreys next season by  with the Liberty Stadium club but the Welsh region have released him for this "once in a lifetime" opportunity. An Ospreys statement said: "Taking into account his fantastic service to the Ospreys, we understand that this is a once in a lifetime opportunity for Shane and his family to experience a new culture and life in a new country and will not stand in his way. "We wish them the best of luck in Japan and look forward to welcoming Shane back to Ospreylia upon completion of his playing commitments, when he will continue to represent the region with distinction off the field." Williams is second in international rugby's all-time try-scoring list behind Australian wing David Campese. And the legendary wing follows former Ospreys team-mates Jerry Collins and Filo Tiatia, who joined Yamaha Jubilo and Toyota Verblitz respectively in 2011, to Japan.	Wales' record international try-scorer Shane Williams has completed a U-turn on his rugby retirement and will play for a Japanese side next season.
PSA, which includes Peugeot, wants to buy General Motors' loss-making European arm, which includes Vauxhall plants at Luton and Ellesmere Port. There are fears that the deal could lead to job losses. Carlos Tavares, boss of PSA Group, is also set to hold talks with Unite union leader Len McCluskey. The company said it was engaged in a "constructive dialogue" with all parties. Vauxhall employs 4,500 workers at the two UK plants, with thousands more involved in its retail and components chain. A Downing Street spokesman said a request for a meeting with Mr Tavares had been received, adding: "The meeting will take place, in principle, subject to diary availability." Unite general secretary Mr McCluskey said he was pleased Mr Tavares had "responded speedily and positively" to his request for a meeting to discuss Peugeot's intentions. He said he would use the meeting to press the case for the UK's "world class facilities and workforce". Apart from meeting the prime minister, PSA will also see Germany's Angela Merkel. It could end up like a corporate beauty parade as Britain and Germany hope to persuade PSA not to shut factories in their respective countries. That's now a real possibility after General Motors said this week that it was in talks to sell its European brands of Opel and Vauxhall to PSA. European car manufacturers have far more production capacity than they need and PSA will probably want to consolidate its factories if it acquires GM Europe. Vauxhall's factories in Ellesmere Port and Luton are both very efficient, but they could face export tariffs when Britain leaves the single market, and probably the customs union, in two years - making those plants unviable. PSA said it was engaged in a "constructive dialogue" with all parties in the bid for GM's European division, which includes German-based Opel as well as Vauxhall. A spokesman said: "Our intention is to establish the same maturity in our exchanges in France, Germany and the UK. "This is why Carlos Tavares has asked to meet Theresa May as it was done with German authorities." David Bailey, professor of industrial strategy at Aston Business School in Birmingham, told the BBC that a deal would not be straightforward. "I think it's inevitable if this deal goes ahead that there will be plant closures. The plants in the UK look particularly vulnerable because of flexible labour markets and uncertainty over Brexit," he said. "So the government I think at some point will have to cut a deal with Peugeot, as it did with Nissan, over things like skills, innovation, rebuilding the supply chain. "And basically, what Nissan got, whatever it was, every other car producer in the UK will be looking for as well."	Prime Minister Theresa May has agreed to meet the head of France's PSA Group to discuss its planned takeover of Vauxhall in the UK.
His death was announced in a tweet by talent agency Conway van Gelder Grant. Born in 1925, the Rada-trained actor performed with the RSC and starred in the first production of Equus in 1973 . The National Theatre also marked his passing on Twitter, calling him "one of the most highly-regarded actors of his generation". Other notable stage roles included the Fool alongside Paul Scofield in Peter Brook's 1962 production of Shakespeare's King Lear. He also travelled the world with a one-man performance of St Mark's Gospel and played a detective in Alfred Hitchcock's Frenzy. To many, though, he will be best remembered for his brief appearance as Q - here nicknamed Algy - in 1983's Never Say Never Again. "Now you're on this, I hope we're going to have some gratuitous sex and violence!" he was seen telling Connery's James Bond in the "unofficial" remake of 1965's Thunderball. The character Q has also been most recently played by Ben Whishaw, as well as Desmond Llewelyn and John Cleese. McCowen, who was made an OBE in 1972 and a CBE in 1986, is survived by his sister Jean, two nephews and two nieces. His partner, the actor Geoffrey Burridge, died in 1987.

The Football League wants to create an extra division with 20 teams in each from 2019-20. It would mean England has 100 teams in five divisions, up from 92. There are currently 24 teams in the Championship, League One and League Two. The Football League says the move would tackle fixture congestion and boost the finances of its members. The Premier League and the Football Association have backed the proposal "in principle". Of the current 72 Football League clubs, 90% must support the proposal for it to go ahead. A decision will be made at their annual general meeting in June 2017. "There are clear benefits for everyone," Football League chief executive Shaun Harvey told BBC Sport. "It is about taking a step back to try to work out what is best for English football. "We hope that the Football League taking this first step is the catalyst for future change." However, the proposal has attracted mixed reaction from Football League clubs. Accrington owner Andrew Holt said it had "no merit", while former Leyton Orient chairman Barry Hearn believes it "has value". Other club bosses complained they had not been told about the plan before it was announced on Thursday. 'Football League shake-up would see clubs struggle financially' The Football League believes the move would help: Harvey said the Premier League and the FA have backed the idea in principle because "they can see potential benefits on an international basis". "The whole game needs to come together," he added. "It is about finding solutions that supports English football for the future." The FA said the fixture schedule needs looking at "for the benefit of all". "These are interesting draft proposals and we look forward to further discussions over the coming months," it added. Mark Lawn, the joint-chairman of Bradford City, believes the current system should not be changed. "We've had this structure for years because it has suited the majority of clubs, so why change it?" said Lawn, whose team are taking part in the League One play-offs. "What they don't understand is that currently we have 23 home games. We need the crowds. Losing four home games means we lose four incomes." Brentford chief executive Mark Devlin thinks the Football League should be praised for an "innovative and far-reaching approach". "These proposals are a really good start for how we can tackle some of the problems Football League clubs are facing," he added. For the proposal to be approved, it needs the backing of 65 Football League clubs (90%) at next year's AGM. The Football League says its board is offering "no recommendation other than asking its members to give full consideration to the proposal". The decision will have to be confirmed by November 2017. Relegation from the Football League would be scrapped in the 2018-19 season, How the promotion/relegation system would work during 2018-19 is still to be determined. Rotherham chairman Tony Stewart said he was concerned the proposal could widen existing financial gulfs between the divisions. "There is also a divide between the Championship and League One and Two and the gaps need filling in," he added. Currently, the bottom two teams in League Two are relegated from the Football League to the National League. They would not go down at the end of the 2018-19 season, said Harvey. Six other clubs - in addition to the two clubs already promoted from the National League - would join the Football League. "The logical place for the extra clubs to come from would be promoting the next six teams from the National League," said Harvey. "Some of those teams are already professional and the extension to the league may suit them." Scottish Premiership sides Celtic and Rangers have long been linked with moving into the English pyramid. In 2009, Premier League clubs voted to reject a proposal to bring the Old Firm rivals into the English top flight. Harvey has not ruled out the involvement of the Glasgow clubs, but added such a move would be difficult. But he dismissed suggestions Premier League clubs could field B teams in the lower divisions. Former Leyton Orient chairman Hearn told Sky Sports: "[Premier League B teams] would destroy the fabric of the Football League. It is poorly thought and would be a sell-out to the Premier League." The major impact would be felt by Football League clubs, who would see their number of matches reduced from 46 to 38 per season. Despite the potential of losing revenue from three fewer home matches, Harvey has asked the 72 clubs to take a "broader view of English football". "We have to make sure none of our clubs are in a financially worse position," he added. "Our clubs shouldn't be the only one to shoulder the burden. We won't be looking for clubs to take a financial haircut to support this. "We believe focusing on weekend games will, over period of time, drive bigger attendances and increase quality of performance on the pitch." Accrington owner Andrew Holt believes the new structure, if approved, would have costly financial implications for many lower league clubs. Holt said the Lancashire club would not be voting in favour of the proposal. He said: "We don't want to lose any games. We'd rather play 50 home games. because we need revenue. "If were going to play 20 times a year it's hardly worth having a stadium. I can't see any sense or any logic in the proposals. "It's just not going to get our support. I need them coming up with better ideas where we can get more games on and generate more revenue for our clubs. "These bottom clubs don't have a lot of revenue and we need to build it, not reduce it." Long midweek trips across the country for fans are "in the main" going to disappear, said Harvey. "There a hardcore of fans who are more than happy to go length and breadth of the country," he added. "But I think less games will make the Saturday at a stadium more special and more important. "It is going to be interesting to see how fans accept this. I'm hopeful it will be positive." The Football Supporters' Federation, a democratic organisation representing the rights of fans in England and Wales, said it would consult supporters at all levels. "The fans' voice has to be heard in this debate," it added.

English football could be heading for its biggest shake-up since the creation of the Premier League in 1992.
Mancini said a fully-fit Tevez could wear the sky blue shirt again, despite previously asserting that the Argentina international was "finished" at City. Tevez remains at City after interest from AC Milan, Inter Milan and Paris St Germain failed to turn into a transfer. "If he comes back - and he is fit - it is possible," conceded Mancini. I hope for him he has been training in the last three months to help his condition Tevez, 27, remains in Argentina and, as yet, there has been no indication when the striker may return. "Carlos is not an option at the moment but it is possible in the future if he comes back," added Mancini. "I hope for him he has been training in the last three months to help his condition. "There is only one thing on my mind, the Barclays Premier League." Mancini has confirmed Owen Hargreaves remains available but has struggled to gain any consistent form during his time at City, triggering the deadline-day loan deal that saw David Pizarro move from Roma. "Owen always has these little problems," said Mancini. "When he came to us in the summer we took a gamble because he had not played for two years. "We thought we could try and get him fit in two or three months and then he would be able to play. "But, like any player who hasn't played for two years, when they start to train, every day there is a problem, with his knee or his hamstring. "I hope for him he eventually is able to play all the time. He deserves to." Club captain Vincent Kompany has insisted City have the mental strength to keep their title challenge on course. City have had a mixed set of results in January, allowing Manchester United to draw level with them on points at the top of the Premier League table. If people want to underestimate us, then please do so But Kompany expects his team-mates to thrive on the pressure as they aim for a first top-flight title since 1968. He said: "If anything it will give us a boost to carry on and if people want to underestimate us, then please do so." The pressure has increased on City in recent weeks, with their 1-0 league defeat at Everton on Tuesday night coming at the end of a period which included cup defeats by Liverpool and neighbours Manchester United. The Goodison Park defeat marked Kompany's return to the City team after a four-game suspension following his red card in the 3-2 FA Cup third round loss to United in January. And he says he expects City to bounce back from the disappointment against Everton with a win against Fulham at Etihad Stadium on Saturday. "There is no shame in going under at Everton," he said. "It wasn't enjoyable, but we believe we can go back to our best football and win the games that are left to play."	Manchester City boss Roberto Mancini has named Carlos Tevez in his 25-man squad for the remainder of the season - and admitted he could pick him again.
The US has said the bombing, which took place in the Afghan city of Kunduz, was a mistake and it was attempting to strike the Taliban. MSF wants the bombing to be investigated as a war crime. Mr Obama has also apologised to the president of Afghanistan. "If it is necessary to hold individuals accountable, that will be done," said White House spokesman Josh Earnest. Mr Obama "expressed his condolences" to MSF president Joanne Liu, said Mr Earnest. "In the United States when we make mistakes, we're honest about it. We own up to it," he said. Mr Earnest also hinted at the possibility of paying victims and their families, a Department of Defense policy. He said he could not say legally whether the bombing was a war crime but the US "goes to great lengths to limit the loss of life" of civilians. In a statement, MSF said they received the apology but it was still demanding the International Humanitarian Fact-Finding Commission (IHFFC) investigate. MSF has said it would not trust internal military inquiries into the bombing. The IHFFC was set up in 1991 under the Geneva Conventions. MSF says the co-ordinates of the hospital were well-known and its bombing could not have been a mistake. A number of inquiries have been ordered - by the US justice department, the Pentagon, Nato and an American-Afghan team.	US President Barack Obama has apologised to the president of aid agency Medecins San Frontieres (MSF) for a bombing that killed at least 22.
Aiden Webb, 22, from Norwich, was climbing Fansipan mountain alone on Friday when he fell down a ravine and lost his way, his girlfriend Bluebell Baughan said. Mr Webb, described as an experienced climber, was last heard from on Saturday when his phone went dead. The Foreign Office confirmed it was assisting his family. Mr Webb and Miss Baughan were on a four-month trip when he injured his arm and knee in the fall on the 3,100m (10,300ft) high Fansipan mountain in the north of Vietnam. More on this and other stories from Norfolk "He went to the mountain alone without a guide at 06:00 and aspired to climb it in one day," Miss Baughan said. She was in touch with Mr Webb by phone when he informed her he had fallen and could not find his way back to the trail. "He was sure he could make it back but by nightfall it was apparent he wasn't going to," she said. "Aiden said a rock had cut his arm open and he had hurt his knee. We were in touch all night. "He said no-one would be able to find him, but by 6am on Saturday he finally agreed to me getting help." Miss Baughan, who is helping co-ordinate the search from the town of Sa Pa, said rescuers had been on the mountain since Saturday morning. "Thirty-two men spent last night on the mountain, a mixture of military police, forestry workers and local police. "There is only one police officer here in Sa Pa who speaks English, but everyone has been very helpful," she said. Miss Baughan said conditions on the mountain were "very cold and wet". "Aiden is a very good climber, but he is injured," she said. Mr Webb's father and uncle are expected to arrive in Vietnam this evening although they will not reach the north until Tuesday. A Foreign and Commonwealth Office spokeswoman said: "We are supporting the family of Aiden Webb, a British man reported missing in Vietnam. We are working closely with the local authorities leading the search."	A British man is missing in Vietnam after falling while attempting to climb the country's highest mountain.
Brandon Lewis said he asked Avon Fire Authority to commission an independent inquiry into the claims, which the authority refutes, on at least two separate occasions last year. The government has since ordered its own investigation. The authority said its chairman will make a statement at its next meeting. A spokesman said: "The fire authority will not be making a comment today, but the chairman will be making a statement at the next meeting of Avon Fire Authority on Friday 10 February." The allegations over the fire authority, which oversees the fire and rescue service, have not been detailed, but have been described as "serious and persistent" by the Home Office. Three senior officers left the authority in five years under "unusual circumstances". The BBC also uncovered evidence of infighting. But the fire service chief, Kevin Pearson has maintained the allegations as "old and unfounded". Mr Lewis said the complaints, if well-founded "would indicate that the authority was failing in its duty to make arrangements to secure continuous improvement". Independent consultant Dr Craig Baker will lead the statutory inspection. He has advised public sector organisations for over 30 years in the UK and overseas.	A fire authority repeatedly refused to start an investigation into allegations over the way it was being run, the fire service minister has said.
Complaints have been made across the UK about the fad, which sees people dress up in order to frighten passers-by. Dyfed-Powys Police received about 30 reports over the weekend and North Wales Police said it was aware of incidents. Gwent Police had 18 reports, including clowns "peering through windows". South Wales Police put out a warning at the weekend after receiving complaints about people dressed as clowns "frightening others intentionally". Chf Insp Paul Staniforth of Gwent Police said: "Some of the reports have included, clowns running through gardens and peering through windows, lurking around shopping centres, parks and schools and jumping from trees. "Fortunately, to date, we've had no reports of anyone being harmed during these reports." He said people could be arrested for a public order offence - causing harassment, alarm or distress. The culprits are said to be following a trend that started in the US. Sgt Rhys Williams of Dyfed-Powys Police said while dressing up was not a criminal offence, "deliberately scaring someone, causing harassment, alarm or distress could lead to arrest". Officers were looking into some of the reports, but no arrests have been made. Sgt Williams added: "Please be mindful that what seems like a bit of fun to you, could not be seen the same way by those on the receiving end of this prank. "There is also the possibility that you could attempt to scare the wrong person and they could retaliate. "Anyone who commits a criminal offence should be aware that dressing as a clown does not make them exempt from being investigated and dealt with through the Criminal Justice System." North Wales Police said officers were aware of incidents, but no offences had been reported.	Sightings of "creepy clowns" have been reported across Wales, with police warning people they could be arrested for scaring others.
The warning comes as the Scottish curry industry will celebrate its annual awards ceremony in Glasgow on Monday. The rules prevent non-EU chefs being employed if a restaurant offers a take-away service. The UK government said this was designed to drive innovative cuisine. But industry sources say it has led to restaurants closing because they cannot recruit skilled chefs. The rules, laid down by the Migration Advisory Committee (MAC) and the Home Office, are part of the Tier 2 visa scheme, which allows workers of sufficient skill levels to be employed on the Shortage Occupation List. They must be paid at least Â£29,570 a year, and to meet the criteria the job must also not be in a fast food or "standard fare" outlet, or an establishment which provides a take-away service. But Ajmal Mushtaq, who runs a restaurant in Hamilton providing up to 3,000 meals a week, said that was "total insanity". Holding two portions of a curry - one on a plate, the other in a take-away carton - he said: "Here is a chicken tikka chasni, one of our top selling dishes. "What the government are saying is: if I put that same dish into a container, I'm not allowed to bring expert chefs over from India. "The quality is the exact same." Mr Mushtaq said the restriction meant that plans to expand his restaurant have been put on hold. He currently employs three Indian-born chefs who have been in Scotland long enough to qualify for permanent resident status, but wants to increase his staffing. "As a result of bringing over three chefs a few years ago, I have been able to create 52 jobs in this business," he said. "We are at the point of expanding our business. If I were to bring over another two chefs, I would be able to increase the number of employees up to 95 in this one establishment alone." The industry has been putting pressure on the government to review its rules, particularly in the wake of the Brexit vote, which it sees as offering an opportunity to workers outwith the EU. International Development Secretary Priti Patel, who campaigned for a Leave vote said during the campaign, said it was a "travesty" that curry houses were subjected to a "second class UK immigration system" in comparison to EU chefs. With a growth in online apps such as Hungry House and Just Eat promoting home delivery of food, Hans Ram, chief executive of the catering recruitment agency Goldstar Chefs, said the government approach to the Indian restaurant sector was wrong. "They have totally misunderstood and misconceived the industry as being a low-paid, low-skilled jobs base. Which it is not," he said. "The biggest consequence to this is actually the skills erosion - erosion of authenticity. "It is affecting the product that the public are being served." He also pointed out that the Indian restaurant sector in the UK is worth an estimated Â£4bn a year.	Indian restaurants are closing in Scotland because strict immigration curbs mean it is difficult to recruit top chefs from the Indian sub-continent, it has been claimed.
He is appealing against an appeal court ruling lifting a ban on him being named in the media in England and Wales. The Supreme Court said it will now hear arguments about whether it should grant an appeal, and if so, decide if it should be "allowed or dismissed". An interim injunction will remain in place until the end of the hearing. On Monday, Court of Appeal judges gave the man - who has young children, and whose spouse is also in the public eye - until 10:00 BST on Tuesday to apply to take the case to the UK Supreme Court. In that ruling, they said there must be no publication leading to disclosure of the celebrity's identity before 13:00 BST on Wednesday. The Supreme Court said that interim injunction will now remain in place until the conclusion of the next hearing. The Sun on Sunday wants to publish an account of alleged extra-marital activities by the man, who is referred to as PJS. But he argues he has a right to privacy and has taken legal action. Monday's court judgement said the celebrity had "occasional sexual encounters" with another person - referred to in court as AB - starting in 2009. They had a text message exchange in December 2011 in which they discussed a "three-way" with AB's partner, CD. Accordingly, the three met for a three-way sexual encounter. In January, the two other parties approached the Sun On Sunday with the story. That month a High Court judge refused to impose an injunction barring publication. But the man appealed and two appeal court judges ruled in his favour. They prevented him being identified in publications in England and Wales. Lawyers for News Group Newspapers - publishers of the Sun On Sunday - then asked Court of Appeal judges to lift the ban. They argued that stories had been published in the US, Scotland and elsewhere where the injunction does not apply. The story had also spread across the internet and on Twitter. PJS opposed that application and said the ban should stay. On Monday, the judges ruled that PJS was now unlikely to be able to get a permanent injunction Details about the allegations were now "so widespread" that confidentiality had "probably been lost", they said. The man's solicitors had been "assiduous" in monitoring the internet and removing stories in breach of the injunction but the judges said that it was now a "hopeless task".	A celebrity who wants an injunction to keep an extra-marital relationship out of the media will put his case at the Supreme Court on Thursday.
The report warns that a failure to reintegrate returnees may lead to further radicalisation. Somalia's Islamist al-Shabab militants are believed to be recruiting heavily in neighbouring north-eastern Kenya. Kenya has seen a series of militant attacks with one at a university earlier this year killed 148 people. Although the report does not mention where the returnees came from, Deputy Secretary General of the Supreme Council of Kenya Muslims (Supkem) Hassan Ole Nadu has confirmed to the BBC that they were fighting for al-Shabab. The 36-page report was compiled by the IOM, Supkem and the Kenya's interior ministry. Researchers found that although most adults joined the group voluntarily, nearly a third of children interviewed said they were forced to enlist. The return of the youth, the report says, provides both "opportunities and threats for and to Kenyans". "On the one hand, they present an opportunity to counter the radicalising ideologies and recruitment strategies of armed groups," the report says. "On the other, the response of the security forces is widely perceived to be promoting further radicalisation as the returnees themselves believe that they are unsafe and have limited reintegration options." Security in the country was identified by participants as the main obstacle to their successful reintegration in the country. A total of 185 respondents were interviewed, representing nearly 30% of the estimated total of 684 returnees in the country. The majority were between 18 and 34 years old.	Nearly 700 recruits have returned to Kenya after quitting militant groups, a report by the International Organization for Migration (IOM) says.
Led by "generals" Mohammed Sajjad, 38, from Cardiff, and Imtiaz Ali, 35, from Newport, the group were involved in bringing the class A drug into Wales. Cardiff Crown Court heard the group was arrested as part of one of the largest undercover operations in Wales. Four were convicted after trial, while six others pleaded guilty to their part in the conspiracy from 2013-2014. Arrests were made after police seized 40kg (88lbs) of the drug in 2014. Most was found inside a speaker and a suitcase in a car stopped on the M5, while a smaller amount was discovered in the footwell of a taxi in Newport. Officers said the seizure had prevented half a million drug deals, the court heard. Sentencing the group, Judge Stephen Hopkins QC, said the gang had dealt in "industrial quantities" of the "highly addictive evil drug". There have been more heroin seizures across the South Wales Police force area than anywhere else in Wales and England, outside London, for at least the past three years, according to figures from the Home Office. During 2014-2015, South Wales Police made 303 heroin seizures per million people. The average for Wales and England was 135 seizures per million. A force spokesman said: "There is a greater focus from the Regional Organised Crime Unit (ROCU) utilising the control strategy - which enables us to prioritise a coordinated approach on regional crime groups and the traffic of drugs."	Ten members of a gang who conspired to supply £5m worth of heroin have been jailed.
British Transport Police said the 15-year-old was attacked by a man and woman in their 40s. The incident happened at Patterton station at about 23:30 on Saturday 3 October. The teenager was punched from behind and stamped on as he lay on the ground, suffering facial injuries, including an injury to his eye. He did not require hospital treatment. His mobile phone was also stolen. The boy had been with a group of friends on the 23:05 service between Glasgow Central and Neilston. Det Con Ryan Tierney, of British Transport Police, said: "This would have been a busy service and I am aware there was an altercation between the group of younger boys and a group of older people shortly before the assault took place at Patterton. "Anyone who was on the train and has information regarding those involved who remained on until it arrived at Neilston at 23:40 is urged to get in touch as a matter of urgency."	A teenager was assaulted and robbed as he got off a train in East Renfrewshire.
The 34-year-old has been absent from the club since a training-ground row after the 5-1 Scottish Premiership loss at Celtic on 10 September. Alongside agent Eddy Jennings, he attended a meeting with club officials last week. Barton, who joined from Burnley in May, has repeatedly said he wants to return and fight for his Rangers place. "Joey Barton has been told he will return to full-time training following the conclusion of a disciplinary procedure," read a statement on Rangers' website. "The Auchenhowie [training base] management team will inform the player of appropriate training arrangements to which he must adhere for as long as he remains a Rangers player. "Neither the club, nor the player, will comment further." Barton is also facing Scottish FA charges for breaching betting rules. He was charged with placing 44 bets on games between 1 July and 15 September. The former Manchester City, Newcastle United and QPR player, who has one England cap, left Burnley under freedom of contract at the end of last season, signing a two-year contract at Ibrox. He has made eight appearances for Mark Warburton's side, who are second in the Premiership. Barton was not available for comment but said earlier on Wednesday on Twitter that it was "a lovely day for a @Iceman_Hof session and a run!" in reference to Dutch ice bath training guru Wim Hof. BBC Scotland's Richard Wilson The fact that Joey Barton is returning to full-time training does not necessarily mean the resumption of his Rangers career. Under Fifa rules, a player under contract at a club must be provided with training facilities. The fact that the player was suspended reflects the view of the management team about the serious nature of a training-ground row in September. Any return to the first-team squad would need to be handled in such a way as to not disrupt the mood and unity among the players. Rangers' statement does not say that Barton is returning to the first-team squad, or will be available for selection, and only the management team at their Auchinhowie training base is mentioned, rather than first-team manager Mark Warburton. Either the player does eventually return to the first-team squad, or his Rangers career effectively remains over and what happens in the January transfer window will be significant.	Rangers say midfielder Joey Barton "will return to full-time training" following a club-imposed suspension.
1 June 2016 Last updated at 07:33 BST He says his highlight on the International Space Station is the spacewalk he carried out and the moment he stepped into space, describing it as amazing. On his return to Earth, he says the first meal he'd like to eat is pizza. But although he's returning to Earth in less than three weeks, Tim says there's still a lot of work to do on the ISS and science experiments to complete. Peake became the first British astronaut on the International Space Station when he launched into space in December.	British astronaut Tim Peake has been talking about his return to Earth, as his mission in space nears the end.
Alongside them in the shade of a small tent adorned in the colours of the ruling party sit two men and one woman, in whose hands the future of this country are held. Front and centre is the man who has led Zimbabwe since the struggle for independence ended in 1980. President Robert Mugabe is 91 years old, has been in power for 35 years, but still oozes energy and passion addressing his supporters and his nation for more than an hour in the midday sun. He may be slower on his feet, but he's still sharp in his mind. To his left, Grace Mugabe, his second wife and the country's first lady; to his right, Vice-President Emmerson Mnangagwa, the man who could be king. Since the beginning, Robert Mugabe has dealt ruthlessly with his political rivals and outmanoeuvred those presenting any threat to his leadership. Anyone perceived to have too much power has their wings clipped, or as happened last year, is simply blown out of the sky. Joice Mujuru was the vice-president - the one who sat next to him under the tent at the previous Heroes' Day address. She was an heir apparent who apparently became too much of a threat. Hers really was a fall from Grace as the political purge enforced by Mrs Mugabe cast the vice-president and her huge support base out of the Zanu-PF party. Now the man known as ngwenya, the crocodile, is back in the driving seat, 10 years after he suffered a similar fate. "The nickname of the crocodile is very appropriate for Mnangagwa as he has this reputation of lurking just below the surface and only striking when the moment is apposite," said Derek Matyszak, a senior researcher with the Research and Advocacy Unit in Harare. "The fact that he accepted… the vice-presidency would lead some people to think, well he thinks this is the right moment to be there." But what of Grace? Does the first lady have presidential ambitions? "Grace has been trying to increase her political capital in her own right, probably as a defence mechanism for when Mugabe does depart the scene," he said. "That, I think, has been misinterpreted to some extent to suggest that she has presidential ambition." After a period of growth during a government of national unity, Zimbabwe's economy, its currency pegged to the dollar, continues to fall as investors shy away. More than 80% of the government budget is spent on civil service salaries, and companies are laying off workers after a court ruling lifted the requirement to pay off sacked employees. President Mugabe publicly opposes the decision and used his speech to promise parliamentary action to put this right, but the party of the people knows the civil service expenditure is unsustainable and it's tempting to take advantage. In central Harare, the trading spaces are taken up with second-hand clothes and shoes. Among them are a former banker, who is just trying to make ends meet. "It keeps me going," she says. "Most industries are closing at the moment, so unemployment is a bit high, but if they open up industries, I'm sure things will improve." And a computer science student was optimistic she'd find work when she graduated. "You have to be creative enough," she said. "Like right now, selling these things - it's entrepreneurship - so for me it's cool." The government has threatened a ban on pavement thrift stores, and some traders were forced away to stalls outside town a few weeks ago. They've been labelled an eyesore, or unhygienic, but the informal economy doesn't generate tax receipts for the government, and with money short, people aren't spending in the shops. "It's rugged my friend. The economy… it's not going anywhere, it's stagnant," says a taxi tout in an American football shirt. "I'm a qualified accountant, but there's no jobs, you can't find employment anywhere, so I don't know what to do." In his speech to the nation, President Mugabe admitted: "We are still grappling with the task of transforming our economies," but he tried to reassure people things were on the up. There were certainly plenty of tourists at Victoria Falls and the Hwange National Park last week, and Zimbabwe still sits on precious metals and diamonds, but foreign investment is the key and confidence is low. The economic ideas of Emmerson Mnangagwa and his close ally, Finance Minister Patrick Chinamasa, are already impressing Western institutions and those too nervous to invest while the old man prevails. His ambitions for open democracy may not be as advanced, but the right-hand man may be someone the international community can do business with. But President Mugabe, leaning on his lectern as he delivers his speech, is a difficult man to read. After all these years, it's hard to see him settling on a successor and handing over power, unless he's thinking about his family and the political exposure they could face if he died in office. The opposition takes the purge of Joice Mujuru and the internal split in Zanu-PF as a sign of some hope, but it may have had the opposite effect and made a cleaner succession much easier. They are arguably even more divided and unprepared to challenge for power, after losing unfair elections and then failing to gain from a unity government. The cult of personality wins votes in Zimbabwe, which explains why Morgan Tsvangirai still leads the Movement for Democratic Change and holds hopes of one day being president. After 15 years of trying, he's still passionate in his words at least. "We are not waiting for him to die," he said. "We have always done what we believe every struggle should do - you mobilise the people, you re-energise the base. "You continue giving people the hope that a democratic alternative is a possibility." But the strength of those on the podium, alongside the huge golden statue of liberation heroes, still hold the future of this country in their hands.	The huge golden statue of three liberation soldiers - two men and a woman - form the centrepiece of Heroes' Acre, the monument to Zimbabwe's fallen.
Denny Solomona crossed for Castleford, but Wigan led at half-time against the run of play through Lewis Tierney's try and Matty Smith's penalty kick. Grant Millington's try put the visitors back in front, before John Bateman went over to restore Wigan's two-point lead. Nick Gregson got his first senior try and Bateman crossed again late on as Warriors climbed to third in the table. Having suffered their heaviest defeat in Super League since 2005 with a 62-0 loss to Wakefield in their previous fixture, Wigan started slowly but were good value for their win after the break. The hosts failed to take advantage when Luke Gale was sent to the sin-bin for dissent with the scores level in the first half, but Bateman's return to the side after two games out sparked the comeback. Shaun Wane's team also welcomed back Dom Crosby, who made his first Super League appearance of the season having recovered from a hip injury. Solomona moved clear as Super League's leading try-scorer with his 13th of the season, but Tigers were frustrated by improved Wigan defence in the second period as they suffered their fourth defeat in a row at the DW Stadium. Wigan coach Shaun Wane: "I don't want to keep going on about it. But, if you knew what we had gone through this week, there's so much toughness showed in that game against a really good Cas team. "The admiration I have got for my players, the desire to grind out the win with the circumstances that nobody knows about is unbelievable. "There were quite a few good performances, they are a good team and are well coached who know how to defend. "We're not the biggest team, but I thought the way we defended was outstanding." Castleford coach Daryl Powell: "That last try gave the score a bit of an easier look than it was. It was tight all the way through. "We lacked a little bit of quality in our play. I thought we defended awesome, they came at us in the second half with a game plan that put us under pressure. "They made minimal errors and kicked well and we couldn't find a spark to get us out of yardage and into good field position. "They deserved to win the game, they had more ball than us in decent field position and we had to work really hard to keep them out and that drained our energy reserves." Wigan: Sarginson; Tierney, Bateman, Gildart, Charnley; Gregson, Smith; Mossop, Powell, Clubb, Tomkins, Isa, Sutton. Replacements: Crosby, Tautai, Burke, Bretherton. Castleford: Hampshire; Monaghan, Minikin, Webster, Solomona; Holmes, Gale; Lynch, Milner, Jewitt, Holmes, McMeeken, Massey. Replacements: McShane, Millington, Maher, Cook. Referee: Phil Bentham.	Wigan moved level on points with Super League leaders Warrington by coming from behind to beat Castleford.
Media playback is not supported on this device Three people who know Armstrong well gave their thoughts. The wife of former professional road cyclist Frankie Andreu, she claimed, long before his public confession, that Armstrong took banned substances and bullied team-mates. "When the going gets tough, he turns on the charm. He thinks if he can show he's a changed man it might benefit him. The problem with that is that he has no credibility. His actions speak louder than his words." Andreu believes there should be no way back into cycling for Armstrong. "He should forget it. He's not going back into sport. He should go and enjoy something else, enjoy his family. Everyone deserves a second chance, but how many does he want? What is he? A cat." The Sunday Times journalist first raised questions about Armstrong in 1999. He wrote LA Confidential, a book containing evidence that Armstrong used performance-enhancing drugs. "When I see an interview like he's just done with Dan Roan, I just feel this guy hasn't changed one iota. When he's saying everyone was doing it (doping), he's being so unfair to the people who rode the 1999 Tour de France and tours over the following years clean - and plenty did." Walsh believes Armstrong is struggling with being out of the limelight. "This is a guy who would get called up by he president of the United States and asked to go on a mountain bike ride, this is a guy who had direct access to people like Bill Clinton and John Kerry... Bono was a big mate of his. Now, no-one really wants to be associated with him - and that's tough if you were once in the place that Lance Armstrong was in." A former French road cyclist, his career effectively ended when he spoke out against doping in the 1990s. "The fact that he says that he doesn't regret it and that if he went back to the same time, he'd do it again... I think that shows an honesty." Bassons, who clashed with Armstrong after making his doping claims, also thinks the American has changed - or been changed. "When I saw him last year, it wasn't the Armstrong that I knew in the '90s any more. Back then, he was strong, he was hard, he would stare you in the eyes, he was brutal, he was strong and he would never make a mistake. But when I saw him last year, he was alone, he was badly dressed, he avoided eye contact, he didn't seem happy."	In an interview with BBC Sports editor Dan Roan, shamed cyclist Lance Armstrong said he should be forgiven for doping and lying - but also admitted he would probably cheat again.
Helmut Oberlander says he was forced to act as a translator for the squad and did not participate in atrocities. He has fought three prior attempts by Canada to strip his citizenship and won. His lawyer says Mr Oberlander will also fight this latest citizenship revocation, calling it "persecution". A spokeswoman with Citizenship Canada said in a statement to the BBC that "we don't take citizenship revocation lightly, but it is necessary in cases of fraud and serious misrepresentation". Canada says that when Mr Oberlander  applied for entry to Canada in 1954, he obtained his citizenship by knowingly concealing that he had been an auxiliary of the Einsatzkommando, a force that operated behind the German army's front line in the Eastern occupied territories. The squad is responsible for killing more than two million people, many of them Jewish people. "We are determined to deny safe haven in Canada to war criminals and persons believed to have committed or been complicit in war crimes, crimes against humanity, or genocide," said Citizenship Canada's Lisa Filipps. Mr Oberlander has argued in court that he was conscripted, had no alternative than to work for the Germans, and would have been subject to the harshest penalties had he disobeyed. Canada has revoked his citizenship three times since 1995.  Each time it was overturned on appeal. In 2016, Canada's Supreme Court refused to hear the government's appeal of a lower court ruling that Ottawa should reconsider its decision to revoke Mr Oberlander's citizenship. His lawyer Ronald Poulton says Canada "appears prepared to hound Mr Oberlander and his family to his grave". "In order to find Mr. Oberlander complicit in war crimes, given his limited and forced participation with the German military, they had attempted to stretch fiction into fact and to rely on an outdated archaic principle known as guilt by association," he said. Mr. Oberlander was born in Halbstadt, Ukraine in 1924, and he obtained his Canadian citizenship in 1960. Shimon Koffler Fogel, with the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs, praised Canada for its "tireless" efforts to strip Mr Oberlander of his citizenship. "This latest development is an important milestone in bringing a measure of justice to his many victims and their families," he said in a statement. Mr Oberlander's case is expected to be back before a federal court within the next six months.	Canada has revoked the citizenship for the fourth time of a 93-year-old man who has admitted to being a former Nazi death squad member.
Citizens Advice Scotland (CAS) called for urgent government action as it revealed a 47% increase in food bank inquiries on its services. It said it provided advice on emergency food providers 7,400 times in 2014/15. The UK government said the report failed to recognise that poverty in Scotland was at a record low. A spokeswoman for the Department for Work and Pensions said it spends Â£90bn a year on working-age benefits to help the most vulnerable in society. The food bank statistics emerged in a new report - Living at the Sharp End - in which CAS researchers investigated the root cause of the trend. The report revealed clients often arrived at citizens' advice bureaux hungry, having not eaten for days, and with no money for essentials. A total of 71% told researchers they cut down on food when they were faced with a gap in their income. The report also found the service was increasingly seeing people who had exhausted all forms of government support and whose only option was to go to a food bank. The Scottish government is set to gain control of some aspects of welfare in September. Scottish Secretary David Mundell is expected to sign off the transfer and timetable later this week. The report's findings included a profile of the CAS clients who sought advice about food banks. It found that: CAS head of policy and public affairs Susan McPhee, called for urgent government action to prevent people slipping through the safety net of social security. "When reports like this have been published in the past, the standard reaction of the UK government has been to say that there is a support network in place that prevents people falling into destitution," she said. "Our evidence today shows beyond dispute that this is simply not the case. "If it were, there would be no need for food banks at all, yet Scottish CABs had to give food bank advice over 7,000 times last year, and our report shows that too many Scottish families are struggling in severe poverty." The report found changes to the benefits system, low pay, insecure work and the rising cost of living contributed to their clients' money problems. It also discovered that benefits problems - including administrative errors and sanctions - forced people to seek crisis support. The report makes a series of recommendations designed to increase people's resilience to "income shocks", prevent gaps in income and improve crisis assistance. Ms McPhee said: "As our new prime minister takes office, this report makes clear that the social security system is simply not working for the most vulnerable people in our society. "We make a number of recommendations in our report about how to improve this, and we want to work with both governments to make those changes happen. "But it is clear that action is needed now." The DWP said the report failed to take into account the latest statistics on poverty in Scotland. A spokeswoman said: "Work is the best route out of poverty and since 2010 there are 140,000 more people in work in Scotland. "We're also continuing to spend around Â£90bn a year on working-age benefits, supporting the most vulnerable in society."	The most vulnerable people in Scotland are falling into destitution because the benefits system is "simply not working", according to a charity.
The 32-year-old knows Coleman's side will be tough to beat having improved hugely since two defeats by Serbia in the last World Cup qualifying campaign. The Chelsea defender, who has led Serbia to the top of Group D, says they face a difficult match ahead of them. "This is the hardest game since we started qualification," he said. Ivanovic scored in the 6-1 thrashing of Wales in 2014 World Cup qualifying at Novi Sad, in September 2012 - the heaviest defeat in Coleman's reign. A year later he was part of the side which won 3-0 at the Cardiff City Stadium - the last time Wales lost a home qualifier. Set to earn his 91st cap for his country on Saturday, Ivanovic believes the scars of the past will provide extra motivation for Wales. "We know that and we have to be careful with that. We have to play much much better than last time to get something from the game because Wales is a completely different team from that moment," he continued. "Those kind of games happen may be once in 100 years. It's very difficult to win against one team three times in a row even when the opponent is not that strong and you cannot say that about Wales." Serbia go into the game topping the group as they edge the Republic of Ireland on goal difference while Wales are two points adrift in third. The visitors will be without the suspended Manchester City defender Aleksander Kolarov, who is suspended after collecting two bookings in the group. Wales will welcome the return of Arsenal midfielder Aaron Ramsey for the first time in this campaign after his recovery from a hamstring injury. Ivanovic believes they will be stronger for his inclusion, but inevitably the major threat will be Real Madrid star Gareth Bale. "I think he is the biggest name and biggest star in the Wales team. But I think Wales as a group have improved," Ivanovic said. "The team have played a couple of years together to bring results and will, of course, be very difficult to stop Gareth Bale and the rest of the guys." "Most important for us is we have a lot of new things - new coach, new shape of the team. We are still building. We have improved a lot from last summer and we are going in the right direction. "But the way to Russia is so long we have to be careful and we have to play every single game like a final.  We know this is our hardest game so far."	Branislav Ivanovic says Wales will want to avenge their previous two defeats against Serbia when they meet in Saturday's World Cup qualifier.
Radioactive cooling water was also mistakenly discharged into a submarine reactor compartment, the Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) reported. Reporting of safety incidents at the base, which refits Britain's nuclear submarines, was "below standard". Contractor Babcock International said safety was its "highest priority". The ONR issued a legal notice to improve after an incident last year in which a worker was contaminated with radiation. The ONR said the dose was "very small" but it "highlighted shortfalls" in health and safety at the yard. Babcock has been ordered "to bring the arrangements up to an acceptable standard" before the end of January 2016. The ONR said five other incidents broke safety rules between October and December last year. They were: The ONR also reported "shortfalls in the operation of the emergency monitoring vehicles" during a nuclear submarine accident exercise. Peter Burt, researcher at the anti-nuclear weapons pressure group Nuclear Information Service, said: "This is a worrying string of events in a short time at Devonport. "If the site operators are not able to improve performance rapidly the MoD should take steps to take the operating contract away from Babcock." Nuclear engineering consultant John Large, who has advised the government and environmental groups on nuclear issues, said: "These are not uncommon incidents in a complex operation like Devonport. "But the level of detail is not good enough. For instance what is the connection with the torpedo tubes and a radiological incident on the submarine?" The ONR declined to go into any more detail on the incidents, saying the reports were intended as summaries. Babcock said in a statement: "Improvements relating to the ONR enforcement notice and other recently reported incidents at Devonport Royal Dockyard are being addressed through a broader nuclear safety improvement programme to further enhance our current high levels of safety, in agreement with ONR." Plymouth City Council said it "takes the safety of nuclear operations at Devonport extremely seriously, as does the site operator. "It is protocol that we are informed immediately of any safety issues or incidents that are likely to be of concern to the wider public. "The operator also reports on its safety performance every six months at the local liaison committee." The Ministry of Defence (MoD) declined to comment.	Devonport naval base has been warned of legal action after a worker received a dose of radiation amid a series of safety breaches.
Mohammed Haji Sadiq denies committing 15 child sex offences over a 10-year period. Mr Sadiq, from the Cyncoed area of the city, taught Koran Studies at the Madina mosque between 1976 and 2006. Cardiff Crown Court heard he "took advantage of his position". He is accused of eight offences of sexual assault of a child under 13 by touching and seven offences of indecent assault. The allegations involve four girls and are said to have taken place between 1996 and 2006 at the mosque, then situated on Woodville Road in the city. The court heard the girls were aged between five and 11 at the time of the alleged offences. The jury heard Mr Sadiq would touch the girls in intimate places. Prosecuting barrister Susan Thomas said one of the alleged victims was told to lay face down on the defendant's lap, while he touched her bottom. When interviewed by police the defendant said the allegations were made for political reasons within the mosque and that other allegations were for "financial motivation". Mr Sadiq has had no involvement with the mosque since 2006. The trial is due to last up to 10 days.	An 81-year-old man who taught at a Cardiff mosque created a culture where physical punishment "was the norm", a court has heard.
Kat Merchant and Emily Scarratt scored early tries for England before Rawina Everitt crossed for New Zealand. Further tries from Merchant and Roz Crowley put England 24-10 up before Selica Winiata crossed on half-time. Jo Watmore added a fifth try and Scarratt's boot did the rest, Kendra Cocksedge's late try mere consolation. 23 Nov: England 16-13 New Zealand 27 Nov:  England 17-8 New Zealand 1 Dec: England 32-23 New Zealand England head coach Gary Street said: "Obviously we're hugely delighted to have won here at Twickenham and to wrap up the series in front of a big home crowd. The players, as a group, were once again outstanding and they showed tremendous mental strength to get through this series and win it 3-0. "There is a lot of trust in this group and that shows every time a squad member pulls on the England shirt. We may not have won a World Cup for many years but we are definitely the number one side in the world at the moment." England produced some superb flowing rugby at Twickenham, with the backs profiting from the good work of the forwards to run New Zealand ragged on occasions. The Black Ferns had the edge in the maul but they could not cope with England's pacy all-round game. New Zealand showed attacking intent from the off but after early pressure England broke out from their own 22 as Natasha Hunt took a quick tap penalty. Watmore made good ground, producing a couple of trademark hand-offs, and Merchant supported well to scorch over in the corner. Three minutes later Scarratt latched onto Katy McLean's neat chip and full-back Scarratt converted her own try to make it 12-0. 2010: New Zealand 13-10 England 2006: New Zealand 25-17 England 2002: New Zealand 19-9 England New Zealand hit back as Everitt crossed for a converted try but the hosts were soon back on the front foot, with Merchant beating three tacklers and taking another one over the line with her for an unconverted try. Kelly Brazier landed a penalty for New Zealand as the scoreboard continued to kick over but England had the upper hand and they added a fourth try, converted by Scarratt, as prop Crowley finished off another fine attack. New Zealand are not world champions for nothing though and, with England down to 14 after Heather Fisher was sin-binned, Winiata scored in the corner to make it 24-15 at half-time. The visitors cut the gap to six points soon after the restart as Brazier squeezed over a penalty, but that was as close as they would get. The Black Ferns lost Aroha Savage to the sin-bin and Watmore made them pay with a fine try after an arcing outside break, and Scarratt soon added a penalty to give England a 32-18 lead. Cocksedge cut the gap for the world champions but England ended the game on top and looked the more likely scorers at the final whistle.

Turner, who spent nine years as a player with Posh before winning back-to-back promotions as manager in the early 1990s, was diagnosed with frontal lobe dementia in 2006. His wife Lynne previously said doctors told her the illness was "caused by heading too many balls". Turner also played for Cambridge United, Luton, Swindon and Southend. He started his playing career at Peterborough in 1969 and made more than 300 appearances. His playing career also included time in the US. Turner retired as a player in 1984 and took over as boss at Cambridge United a year later, managing them until 1990. His successful reign at Peterborough ended in 1992, when he stood down to become chairman. Mick Halsall, who captained Peterborough to victory in the play-off final in 1992, said Turner was a "great, great leader". "He had a great ability to nurture," Halsall said. "[We were] a bunch of scallywags who achieved so much, and in my opinion wouldn't have achieved it under anyone else." Bob Symns, Peterborough chief executive, said Turner was "a legend who'll never be forgotten". John Beck, who was brought to Cambridge as a player by Turner in 1986 and went on to take the club to the brink of the Premier League as manager, said Turner was a "very lovable man". "I'd gone to meet the manager at Peterborough and I was going to sign, but then I got a phone call from Chris," he said. "I went down to the Abbey (Stadium) and knew instantly that this was the man I wanted to sign for. "He was just a wonderful person. Great warmth, great fun, great personality."	Former Peterborough United and Cambridge United manager Chris Turner has died, aged 64.
The search engine has also revealed we asked "Who is Banksy?" and "What is ALS?" more than anything else. The deaths of Peaches Geldof, Robin Williams and Rik Mayall also featured in the top 10 trending search list. Flappy Bird, the Grand National and Jennifer Lawrence appeared in the top searches as well. Ebola was the top news story of the year, followed by ALS - inspired by the ice bucket challenge which aimed to promote awareness of Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis - and Malaysia Airlines, which lost two passenger planes in separate incidents during 2014. Take our quiz to see how well you know your city Luis Suarez's bite on Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini during the World Cup was fourth, with the Scottish Independence vote fifth. Cliff Richard, the celebrity photo hack and Oscar Pistorius were also in the top 10. Google is often used to answer questions, with the most common this year being "Who is Banksy?" That was followed by "Who is Frenchy?" - the Celebrity Big Brother star - with rapper Dappy, Palestinian group Hamas and Isis also appearing on the list. Googlers in 2014 were also asking for tips on learning new skills, with the most popular being "How to draw", followed by "How to kiss" and "How to crochet". Kissing was the most popular "How To" search in Newcastle, Leeds, Glasgow, Liverpool, Brighton, Nottingham, London and Edinburgh. Finding out how to meditate, knit, twerk and squat were also among the most popular things Google users wanted to know. While there were a host of celebrity deaths in 2014, the loss of Peaches Geldof was the most searched for, followed by Robin Williams and Rik Mayall. Beyonce topped the most searched female celebrity list, beating the likes of Jennifer Lawrence and Katy Perry to the number one spot. Pop star Ariana Grande topped the rising female celebrity list, with British vlogger Zoella also making it into the top five. Ed Sheeran tops the male celebrity list with fellow singer Pharrell sitting at the top of the rising list, with Sherlock star Benedict Cumberbatch second. In sport, there was something of a surprise as Hull City were the fourth most searched for Premier League team, ahead of both Chelsea and Manchester City.

Christie - 'Every place in America is a target' 17:40 ET By the time the afternoon session of the Republican Jewish Coalition presidential forum was wrapping up, most of the participating candidates were all but certain as to the exact nature of the violence in San Bernardino. "I assure you it is an act of terror," said former Virginia Governor Jim Gilmore, later warning that this was just the beginning. "We have to be prepared because the world is breaking down." Carly Fiorina took aim at the likely Democratic nominee. "Hillary Clinton was tweeting about gun control while we learned that radical Islamic terrorists have been building pipe bombs," she said. And New Jersey Governor Chris Christie spent nearly his entire 30-minute speech talking about the implications of Wednesday's attacks. "For the first time since 9/11," he said, "we're going to have to confront the loss of American life on American soil to terrorist conduct." And he added some words of warning. "If a centre for the developmentally disabled in San Bernardino, California, can be a target for a terrorist attack, then every place in America is a target for a terrorist attack." The New Jersey governor is pinning what were once fading presidential hopes on national security. After the Paris attacks and the events on Wednesday, he feels the US public is giving him another look - and a recent poll of New Hampshire voters shows that he has gained some momentum, moving ahead of Ben Carson into fourth place. "The entire campaign changed a few weeks ago," he said. "We need to come to grips with the concept in America that we are in the midst of the next world war." He went on to attack fellow candidates Rand Paul by name and Ted Cruz by implication - both for voting in the Senate to support a rollback of National Security Agency surveillance operations that went into effect last weekend. "Every candidate who comes on this stage should be honest with you and tell you we need to do these things," he said. "And anyone who doesn't is putting American families at risk." 13:30 ET According to Donald Trump, the violence in San Bernardino on Wednesday "probably was related" to "radical Islamic terrorism". During remarks at the Republican Jewish Coalition, the New York real-estate mogul wondered why President Barack Obama won't use those words. "There is something going on with him that we don't know about," he said. Several years ago, Mr Trump - before he was a presidential front-runner - made the rounds on the political talk show circuit as one of the leading voices of the "birther" movement - that bit of the conservative fringe that questioned the validity of Mr Obama's birth certificate and his American bona fides. Old habits, it seems, die hard. Rubio - 'We live in a different world' 12:00ET "We certainly have learned some facts that are concerning and weigh on our minds,"  Marco Rubio said early in his speech before the Republican Jewish Coalition presidential forum. The Florida senator no doubt was referencing the possible Islamic ties of the assailants in the San Bernardino shooting - albeit in a much more oblique way than his fellow senator, Ted Cruz, did earlier Thursday morning. "We live in a very different world than the one I grew up in, the world that you grew up in and the world we had not long ago," Mr Rubio continued. While Mr Rubio's words were carefully, intentionally vague, Mr Cruz wasn't the only candidate to directly tie Wednesday's attacks to overseas terrorism. Inadequate gun-control laws are not to blame for the California shootings, South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham told reporters after his speech. "It's about two people who have bought into an ideology that's just absolutely insane." Former New York Governor George Pataki said we don't know for sure whether the shootings in San Bernardino "involved terror or not", but it was a "horrible, horrible planned assault". What we do know, he continued, was that the bombings at the Boston Marathon, the shooting at the US Army base at Fort Hood and the foiled assault at an art exhibit in Garland, Texas - all of which have happened during Barack Obama's presidency - were "carried out by radical jihadists here in America". The US should not let First Amendment protections of free speech stand in the way of confronting this "warped view of jihad", Pataki continued, comparing a ban on inflammatory Islamic rhetoric to prohibitions on yelling "fire in a crowded theatre". "Radicalisation in America isn't protected speech," he said. "It is a crime, and we should stop it." 10:43 ET Texas Senator Ted Cruz took the stage at the presidential forum hosted by the Republican Jewish Coalition and called for a moment of silence for the victims of the San Bernardino shootings. Then, while acknowledging "the details of what happened are still unclear", he said that he is "deeply concerned" that the events in California are "another manifestation of radical Islamic terrorism here at home". He said the San Bernardino shootings, along with the Paris attacks last month, "underscores that we are in a time of war". "Whether or not the current administration realises or wishes to acknowledge it," Mr Cruz continued. "Our enemies are at war with us. I believe this nation needs a wartime president to defend it." The Texas senator then pitched the audience of Republican Jewish activists and deep-pocketed conservative donors on why he's the man for the job. As he did in last month's Republican presidential debate, he chided President Barack Obama for not using the term "radical Islamic terrorism". A president, he said, must speak the truth. "When the president stands up and says the Islamic State isn't Islamic - that's just nutty," he said, calling Mr Obama an apologist for "radical Islamic terrorism". He said as president he would make sure the US does more to stand by its allies - Israel in particular - and defeat its enemies. "If you are voting for Hillary Clinton," he said, "you are voting for the Ayatollah Khamenei to have a nuclear device."	Republican presidential candidates speaking at a forum in Washington, DC, have responded to the mass shooting in California which left at least 14 dead.
The services will take place at 11:00 GMT on 7 January. The Church in Wales announced the move ahead of the consecration of the first woman bishop, Canon Joanna Penberthy, as Bishop of St Davids on 21 January. In January 1997, 62 women were ordained, with their names set to feature on a new logo. The services will take place at cathedrals in Llandaff in Cardiff, Newport, Bangor in Gwynedd, St Asaph in Denbighshire, Brecon in Powys and St Davids in Pembrokeshire. Canon Enid Morgan was among the first ordained, along with Canon Penberthy, and she will give an address at Bangor Cathedral. She described "frustration" after spending 12 years as a deacon, with a sense of "much energy wasted". But then "things seemed to happen very quickly" after a bill was passed in September 1996 allowing women priests, she said. Canon Morgan added: "A whole generation has grown up seeing women priests and their ministry as normal and we can start taking some things for granted."	The 20th anniversary of the ordination of Wales' first women priests will be celebrated with simultaneous services at every cathedral in the country.
The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it had identified 33 local areas where pubs would not face sufficient competition after the deal. Heineken, which already owns 1,100 pubs, must submit plans to the CMA by 20 June or face an in-depth inquiry. However, the brewing giant said it would address the CMA's concerns. "This decision by the CMA acknowledges that there are only a small number of local areas where competition may be diminished due to our acquisition of the pubs," said David Forde, managing director for Heineken UK. "We are confident we can offer the CMA suitable undertakings to satisfy their concerns." The preliminary CMA investigation concluded that the deal would not damage the chances of Heineken's competitors selling their own products, as the pubs being bought only make up 4% of the market. It also felt that it was unlikely Heineken would reduce the choice of beer and cider available in the Punch pubs, as this could lead it to lose business.	Heineken has been told to address fears that its purchase of around 1,900 pubs from Punch Taverns could affect competition in some areas.
The charred pine twigs date back 140 million years to a time when fires raged across large tracts of land. Pine trees now dominate the forests of the Northern Hemisphere. The research suggests the tree's evolution was shaped in the fiery landscape of the Cretaceous, where oxygen levels were much higher than today, fuelling intense and frequent wildfires. "Pines are well adapted to fire today," said Dr Howard Falcon-Lang of Royal Holloway, University of London, who discovered the fossils in Nova Scotia, Canada. "The fossils show that wildfires raged through the earliest pine forests and probably shaped the evolution of this important tree." The specimens, which are described in Geology journal, were preserved as charcoal within rocks from a quarry. "It was only when I digested [the samples] in acid that these beautiful fossils fell out," Dr Falcon-Lang told BBC News. "They were sitting in my cupboard for five years before I actually worked out what was there." The fossils are just a few mm long but probably came from trees resembling the Scots Pine that now cover large areas of Scotland. Pines are well adapted to fire, containing inflammable deadwood that makes them burn easily. They also produce cones that will only germinate after being scorched, ensuring a new generation of trees is seeded after the fire has passed by and other vegetation has been destroyed. Scientists have debated for many years why some trees seem to thrive on wildfires. "One of the oddities about pine trees today is that they are one of the most fire adapted species on our planet," explained Dr Falcon-Lang. "These oldest pine fossils are preserved as charcoal, the product of fire, suggesting that the co-occurrence of fire and pines is something that's very ancient, that goes back to the very origin of these first pine trees." Dr Falcon-Lang plans to return to the quarry this summer to recover more specimens. He hopes to find fossils of flowering plants, which were evolving at the same time as the ancient pines.

6 March 2017 Last updated at 14:51 GMT The window was smashed before accelerant was poured inside and it was set alight at 03:30 GMT on Sunday at the Park Regis Hotel in Broad Street, Birmingham. Mayweather was appearing in the city, meeting fans as part of a tour. An eyewitness who filmed the damaged vehicle but did not wish to be named said: "He [Mayweather] was actually outside when the van was set on fire, then he ran back in. More on this story and others around Birmingham and the Black Country. "There was panic inside the whole hotel. Nobody was allowed out of the hotel for a couple of hours. They had the whole hotel on lockdown." There is no sound on the video.	A van used by retired world champion boxer Floyd Mayweather has been set on fire, police said.

The three-week trial on the 23.4m long 'up' escalator at Holborn station is taking place during peak hours. Transport for London said the move will "increase the capacity" and prevent "queuing at the bottom" as people stand on both sides of the escalator. More than 56 million passengers use the station every year. Usually passengers stand to the right, leaving the left side free for people to walk up or down the escalators. Holborn Tube station, one of the busiest on the network, is set to get a new entrance and an enlarged ticket hall in order to increase its capacity by 80% by 2022. Peter McNaught, operations director for the Central line, said: "In the meantime, as part of a three-week trial to reduce queues and keep people moving through the station, we are encouraging customers to stand on both sides of the 'up' escalators during busy periods. "We believe this will increase the capacity of the escalators as more people will be able to board, preventing queuing at the bottom of the escalator."	Commuters are being asked to stand rather than walk on the left side of escalators at a central London Tube station to see if it can cut queues.
He was the only person nominated after the previous leader, Jamie Adams, pulled out of the contest. Mr Simpson left the council's cabinet and Independent Plus Political Group (IPPG) in 2014 over disagreements about the way the group was being run. The IPPG has led the council since 1996 but lost 20 councillors in the 4 May elections. Mr Simpson won the backing of the Labour, Liberal Democrat, Conservative and Plaid Cymru members in his leadership bid.	Unaffiliated councillor David Simpson has been elected as the new leader of Pembrokeshire council.
Coffins representing two men and two women who resisted the Nazis in World War Two were carried through the French capital before being interred. The coffins contained only soil from the fighters' graves as their relatives did not want their bodies disturbed. French President Francois Hollande said the group "embodied the spirit of the Resistance". A ceremony was held at the Pantheon alongside the coffins of Germaine Tillion, Genevieve de Gaulle-Anthonioz, Pierre Brossolette and Jean Zay. Tillion, who died in 2008, and de Gaulle-Anthonioz, a niece of former French leader Charles de Gaulle who died in 2002, were caught and deported to the Ravensbruck concentration camp in Germany. Brossolette, a radio journalist who broadcast on the BBC during the war, committed suicide after being arrested and tortured in 1944. Zay, who was minister of education before the war, was killed in 1944, having tried to set up a government-in-exile in north Africa. "Faced with the occupation, with submission, they gave the same response," Mr Hollande said. "They said 'no', immediately, firmly, clearly." Mr Hollande drew parallels with those who marched in French cities on January 11 this year, days after terror attacks on the Charlie Hebdo newspaper and a kosher supermarket. The induction now sees three women interred at the Pantheon, after the scientist Marie Curie. There are now 74 men interred at the mausoleum, the first being the writer Victor Hugo.	France has honoured four members of the French Resistance with a ceremony at the Pantheon mausoleum in Paris.
Fire, police and coastguard teams were called to Butley Creek near Orford, Suffolk, on Wednesday by a member of the public who had seen the supine figure of a man lying in the water. The "body" turned out to be a work of art called A Thousand Tides, which has been at the site for more than a year. A Suffolk Police spokesman described the work as "quite realistic". Read more Suffolk stories here The sculpture, by artist Laurence Edwards, was designed to only be seen at low tide and was intended to sink eventually. However, Mr Edwards said it had "stayed on the surface longer than it should". He said: "I've always been a bit worried that a helicopter would spot it and want to rescue it. "To convince someone it's a real person is a great achievement, although I would like to apologise to the poor person who called it in." The sculpture was a parting gift to the area from Mr Edwards, who had a studio and foundry works nearby for 15 years until spring 2016 before moving to Halesworth. Mr Edwards' website says his work "attempts to do justice to the locality and its history, by peopling it with large figures that have survived the ravages of the water and the elements." Suffolk Police confirmed they attended Butley Creek, saying: "Police received a call from a member of the public reporting what they believed to be a body in the river. "The fire service and coastguard were also called to assist, but a short while later this was actually confirmed to be a sculpture." A Thousand Tides is reminiscent of Antony Gormley's Another Place installation on Crosby beach in Merseyside, which depicts 100 bronze figures looking out over the Irish Sea.	Three different 999 services had to be stood down after a "body in the water" turned out to be a bronze sculpture.
It is part of a wider disposal of problem debt on both sides of the Irish border. Most of the loans - 86% - that are being sold off are in the Republic of Ireland. The rest relate to business in Northern Ireland. While the face value is about £15m, the actual value is now likely to be considerably less. The process starts next week and should be completed by the end of the year. It is understood the loans being disposed of have been under special management for a significant time. The sale is not connected to the squeeze on agricultural incomes linked to the current downturn.	Ulster Bank is to sell off agricultural loans in Northern Ireland with a face value of about £15m.
The Spanish-language TV network had cancelled its contract to broadcast the Miss USA pageant which is co-owned by Mr Trump. Univision had said last week it would not air the pageant because of what it called insulting remarks about Mexican immigrants. Mr Trump is running for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination. Mr Trump has accused Univision of stifling his freedom of speech in order to boost the Democratic Party frontrunner, Hilary Clinton. While announcing his candidacy earlier this month, he had accused Mexico of sending rapists and other criminals to the United States. He also pledged to build a "great wall" on the US border with Mexico and insisted it would be paid for by Mexicans. He later insisted he was criticising US lawmakers, not Mexican people. US TV network NBC has also said it would not be airing the Miss USA and the Miss Universe pageants both owned by Mr Trump. Responding to the announcement, Mr Trump said he would consider suing NBC.	The US presidential candidate Donald Trump has filed a multi-million dollar lawsuit against Univision.

Mr Cameron missed the weekly prime minister's questions to fly to be with his father in hospital. Downing Street said his father died shortly after the PM arrived at the hospital in the South of France. He told ITV in March his father was a "huge hero figure for me" who had a great sense of optimism. It is understood the prime minister will remain in France overnight. Mr Cameron was told on Wednesday morning his father was seriously ill after suffering a stroke and heart complications. After talking to doctors at the hospital, the PM decided to fly to be with his father and mother Mary. Downing Street said French President Nicolas Sarkozy had arranged a helicopter to take Mr Cameron to the hospital so he could see his father. Sources told the Press Association he was "incredibly grateful" as he may not otherwise have been able to get there in time and was "relieved" to have been at his bedside. By Ross HawkinsPolitical correspondent, BBC News To David Cameron his father was a hero, a man who never complained about his disability and a key inspiration behind the 'Big Society' theme that characterised the Conservative election campaign. In a newspaper interview he reflected: "I've never really heard him whinge about anything." After the election Ian Cameron said he always thought David had the capability to be prime minister, but added unlike his son, he was not a politician. He spent his professional life as a stockbroker, and sat on parish and church councils. David Cameron said his father and mother - who worked as a magistrate -  "wore their public service so lightly". David Cameron said he almost gave up politics after his six-year-old son Ivan died last year. Last week the Camerons brought their new-born daughter Florence home to Downing Street. Ian Cameron did not see his grand-daughter before he died. Nick Robinson: Painful times Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, who stood in for Mr Cameron at the first PMQs after the summer recess, sent his thoughts and condolences to Mr Cameron's family and said he was glad the PM was "able to be at his father's side at the end". Chancellor George Osborne told the BBC: "It's a very difficult day for David Cameron and his family. "I know David was very, very close to his father, and his father hasn't been well over recent years, but he's always been a really strong presence I know in David's life, and I'm sure he'll be missed by David and missed by all of us who knew him." BBC political correspondent Laura Kuenssberg said Mr Cameron had often spoken of the close bond between him and his parents, who lived in Peasemore, Berkshire. Ian Cameron, 77, was born with both legs deformed, and endured repeated operations in an attempt to straighten them and ease his pain. Despite his disability he forged a successful career as a stockbroker and is a former director of estate agent John D Wood. The prime minister said before the general election that his father was a "glass half-full" person with a "sense of optimism". He told ITV 1's Trevor McDonald: "My father is a huge hero figure for me, because he's an amazingly brave man.... "To have a disability in the 1930s and 1940s, a different age, was really tough, but  he never let it affect him in any way. " Giles Andreae, a friend of Mr Cameron's, told the BBC: "David adored his father and his mother. I think they both have a really seminal influence in the man he is now and in his politics actually." Mr Cameron's wife Samantha gave birth to their fourth child, Florence, last month. The couple's first child Ivan, who was born profoundly disabled and needed round the clock care, died in February 2009. Mr Cameron's biographer James Hanning told the BBC family was "hugely important" to the prime minister: "They are a very strong family but they have been through it." Labour leadership contender David Miliband said he was "very sorry" to hear the news: "My thoughts are with David and his family." A spokesman for Gordon Brown said the former prime minister had written to Mr Cameron to express his condolences.	Prime Minister David Cameron's father Ian has died after suffering a stroke and heart complications while on holiday in France.
"[President Barack] Obama must now start focusing on OUR COUNTRY, jobs, healthcare and all of our many problems," he tweeted. "Forget Syria and make America great again!" Two years ago Mr Trump built a winning presidential campaign around this very theme, sharply criticising Democrats and some fellow Republicans for what he viewed as their overly interventionist foreign policies. Just a week ago Secretary of State Rex Tillerson appeared to be following this new script when he downplayed calls for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's removal, saying his status "will be decided by the Syrian people". Then on Thursday night, two days after another chemical weapons attack, President Donald Trump ordered a guided missile strike on a Syrian government airfield. The move marks a dramatic turnaround from Mr Trump's prior rhetoric and the expectations of how he would conduct his foreign policy. In his remarks following the missile strike, the president explained that it was in the "vital national security interest of the United States to prevent and deter the spread and use of deadly chemical weapons". He even called on "civilised nations" to end the "bloodshed and slaughter" of the Syrian civil war and insisted that "peace and harmony" will prevail. The man who was thought to be a neo-isolationist now, just months into his presidency, is projecting US military force abroad to enforce international norms and punish human rights abuses. What changed? It seems clear that the graphic images of dead and dying Syrian civilians - including "beautiful babies", in Mr Trump's words - had a dramatic effect on the president's disposition. With a few notable exceptions, the strike is being praised by Washington politicians on the left and on the right. In the coming days, however, some serious questions will be posed. If the president's foreign policy outlook can shift so dramatically in just a few days, if not hours, will allies and adversaries interpret this as a sign of flexibility or incoherence? A cruise missile strike is a low-risk form of military action, but it also is of limited effectiveness. A White House official described this as a warning shot across Mr Assad's bow. If the Syrian president continues to use chemical weapons or conduct conventional attacks that result in significant civilian casualties, will the US escalate its military intervention or back down and risk appearing weak? When Mr Obama contemplated using force against the Syrian government, he decided that he would need congressional authorisation to do so. Will Mr Trump now seek approval from the lawmakers, on both sides of the aisle, who were reluctant to give the Democratic president such approval? Thursday night was Mr Trump's first significant foreign policy challenge, and it appears to have dramatically changed his outlook, his rhetoric and his resulting actions. The candidate who constantly spoke of putting America first ended his brief remarks on Thursday night by calling for God's blessings not just for his nation but for the "entire world". This strike - and this change of attitude - may simply be a one-off event. Or, perhaps, an unlikely globalist has been born.	Four years ago, after the Syrian government launched a brutal chemical attack on its own civilians, Donald Trump warned anyone who would listen that the US should refrain from launching retaliatory military strikes.
The 26-year-old victim had been standing at a bus stop in Wallacewell Quadrant in Glasgow at about 23:45 on Friday when a car pulled up beside him. A young man who was a passenger in the car got out and chased him with a hammer into a nearby park. The car was then driven at him and hit him before two other men jumped out and attacked him with weapons. The attackers then got back into the vehicle - a small silver car - before driving back onto Wallacewell Road. One of the men is described as being in his early 20s with blond hair. He was wearing a red top. The other two men are described as being in their late teens to early 20s. Their victim is being treated at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow. Det Con William Corkindale of Shettleston CID said: "This was a horrendous attack which has left the victim seriously injured and it is imperative that we trace the people responsible. "I would appeal to anyone who was in the area around the time the incident took place, who may have witnessed what happened or saw anything suspicious, to come forward. "We understand that the front passenger window of the small silver car involved was smashed and so I would also ask anyone who noticed a car matching this description to get in touch."	A man has been left in a "serious but stable" condition in an attack being treated by police as attempted murder.
The Â£230m development consists of 11 wind turbines. Mr Trump claims they would spoil the sea views for golfers on his course at Menie. He responded: "We will put our future plans in Aberdeen on hold, as will many others, until this ridiculous proposal is defeated." Mr Trump said: "We will be bringing a lawsuit within the allocated period of time to stop what will definitely be the destruction of Aberdeen and Scotland itself. "This was a purely political decision. "We will spend whatever monies are necessary to see to it that these huge and unsightly industrial wind turbines are never constructed." He had previously threatened not to build a hotel at the resort if it went ahead. Ministers said they were committed to a "successful and sustainable" offshore wind sector. The European Offshore Wind Deployment Centre (EOWDC) project is a joint venture by utility company Vattenfall, engineering firm Technip and Aberdeen Renewable Energy Group (Areg). The project is aimed at providing enough energy for more than 49,000 homes. The Scottish government said the centre would allow offshore wind developers and supply chain companies to test "cutting edge" wind technology before its commercial deployment. Energy Minister Fergus Ewing said: "Offshore renewables represent a huge opportunity for Scotland; an opportunity to build up new industries and to deliver on our ambitious renewable energy and carbon reduction targets. "The proposed European Offshore Wind Deployment Centre will give the industry the ability to test and demonstrate new technologies in order to accelerate its growth. "It secures Aberdeen's place as the energy capital of Europe." He added: "The EOWDC is the first offshore wind farm to pass through the new approvals process for offshore wind development and as such is a test case for the industry. The diligence and expertise of officials in Marine Scotland, among the statutory consultees and other interests should give confidence to the offshore wind industry and its supply chain that planning matters should not be a barrier to investment in Scotland." EOWDC project spokesman Iain Todd said: "The Scottish government's most welcome approval for the EOWDC is extremely positive news for both Scotland and the UK's offshore wind industry as it helps position Scotland, the UK and Europe at the global vanguard of the sector. "The project partners will assess the consent and associated conditions as part of the planning and programming for the next phase of the scheme." Alex Salmond, the MSP for Aberdeenshire East, said: "I welcome this decision. "The north east of Scotland is a world energy capital and in order to continue to prosper we have to be at the forefront of all forms of energy research - marine renewables, as well as oil and gas." Dr Sam Gardner, senior climate change policy officer at WWF Scotland, said: "Giving the go-ahead to this offshore wind test centre is the right decision, demonstrating that no amount of bluster from US billionaires such as Donald Trump will hold Scotland back from becoming a cleaner, greener, job-creating nation." Robert Collier, chief executive of Aberdeen and Grampian Chamber of Commerce, said: "The north east is already established as a global hub for the oil and gas industry. "The development of the EOWDC will enable the region to extend its reach with regard to offshore wind, further enhancing our renewable energy expertise and drawing upon our strong engineering and technology skills base. "This is an important development for the region."	Consent for a wind farm off Aberdeen which is opposed by Donald Trump has been granted by the Scottish government, angering the US tycoon.
The Tower Blocks - Our Blocks project has been described as a "Domesday Book" of the UK's post-war reconstruction. It will include images of towers which have been demolished over the past 30 years, as well as those which are still standing. It has been created by social and architectural historians from Edinburgh College of Art. The project is to receive a Â£52,900 grant of Heritage Lottery funding. This money will go towards digitising the 3,500 photographs, as well as supporting local outreach initiatives which the team hope will encourage high-rise residents to tell their stories. Glasgow's Red Road flats and Gorbals housing schemes will be among the multi-storey housing projects on show in the publically accessible digital catalogue. Other well know high rises to feature in the archive include the Everton flats in Liverpool, Birmingham's Chelmsley Wood, Manchester's Hulme redevelopment, and London estates such as Broadwater Farm, Thamesmead and Roehampton. The project is due to be completed by late 2017. Prof Miles Glendinning, head of the Scottish Centre for Conservation Studies at the college of art, said: "We hope this project will help contribute to the ongoing shift in public attitudes towards the post-war Modernist housing heritage, which is fast turning from an object of dislike and alienation into a force for potential community empowerment. "Council tower blocks were once the most prominent and dramatic legacy of the post-1945 reconstruction drive, but mass demolitions over the past 35 years, still continuing today, have depleted this vast heritage, leaving it obscured or incomprehensible to the public at a time when popular interest in post-war Modernist heritage is sharply increasing." Colin McLean, head of the Heritage Lottery Fund in Scotland, said: "Without archives, vast segments of our nation's history would be missing. "As the high rise towers that have dominated many towns' and city's skylines begin to disappear, it is important for us to capture this heritage and give voice to the experiences of those who live in these flats and communities." Glasgow 2014 chiefs faced criticism when they planned to demolish the Red Road flats as part of last summer's Commonwealth Games opening ceremony. They eventually ditched the proposal to blow down five of the six remaining 1960s blocks live on television amid fears of a public protest. Critics said it was insensitive to former residents and to the asylum seekers who still occupied the sixth block. When they were built between 1964 and 1969, the Red Road flats were the highest in Europe at 292ft (89 metres).

The birds, which are native to southern Europe, set up nests by burrowing tunnels in the banks of Low Gelt Quarry, near Brampton. An RSPB viewpoint on the perimeter of the quarry has attracted more than 1,000 people in two weeks. The RSPB said all chicks had hatched and would fledge in the next few weeks. The pairs were discovered by a foreman, who noticed the colourful birds flying among the site's colony of nesting sand martins. They are expected to leave the nest in about four weeks. Two pairs successfully raised chicks on the Isle of Wight last year and previously in County Durham in 2002. An RSPB spokesman said they were "delighted" the birds had bred in the UK for a second consecutive summer. Bee-eaters can burrow up to 10ft (3m) and usually lay clutches of four to nine eggs.	Visitors have flocked to Cumbria to see two pairs of rare bee-eater birds which set up their home at a quarry.
Justice Secretary Michael Matheson has directed Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary in Scotland to investigate the actions of undercover officers. A review is ongoing in England and Wales, but the UK government has refused to extend it to Scotland, leaving Mr Matheson "disappointed". Victims of police spying had called for a Scottish inquiry to be set up. Holyrood's parties had been united in calling for an extension to the Pitchford Inquiry, which was set up in England and Wales to investigate allegations of misconduct by undercover officers. There are allegations that undercover Metropolitan Police officers had fathered children and caused miscarriages of justice, with claims of this activity extending to Scotland. Mark Kennedy, one of five officers known to have had relationships with women while undercover, is alleged to have infiltrated environmental groups ahead of the G8 summit at Gleneagles in 2005. Labour MSP Neil Findlay wrote directly to the policing minister, Brandon Lewis, but was told that it was "not possible" to extend the probe north of the border for "a number of reasons". Mr Matheson said he was "firmly of the view" that extending Pitchford would be the "right thing to do", and said he was "disappointed" with the UK government's refusal. He said: "Given the operational extend of the units involved, the Scottish government believes that a single coherent inquiry is the most effective approach to provide a comprehensive investigation into these activities. "However, in light of the Home Office's decision I have today directed Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary in Scotland to undertake a strategic review of undercover policing in Scotland." The justice secretary said this investigation would cover "the extent and scale of undercover policing in Scotland" dating back to 2000, as well as operations carried out by the Met Police units under investigation by Pitchford. He added: "This review will also give independent assurance on the operation, procedures and safeguards in place by Police Scotland in relation to undercover policing." The Scottish Liberal Democrats welcomed the news, with Liam McArthur describing the probe as "nothing less than required". But Mr Findlay said it was "minor progress", calling it "the police reviewing the police" rather than the public inquiry he had called for. Victims who are participating in the Pitchford Inquiry had hit out at the decision not to extend it to Scotland, calling on Holyrood to order its own probe. A group of 17 victims issued a joint statement after Mr Lewis refused to extend the inquiry saying they were "extremely frustrated", saying it "sets the inquiry up to fail before it even begins". One of the group, Merrick Cork, added: "It's outrageous that Theresa May thinks victims of police abuse deserve justice in England but not in Scotland. "The police admit English officers committed human rights abuses against citizens on Scottish soil. It's absurd to expect public trust in police when abuses of power are swept under the carpet, and it's a snub to Scotland to say it doesn't matter there." Mr Lewis defended the limited scope of the inquiry, saying it was "extensive and complex" already, and needed to "proceed swiftly" without further delays. He added: "The Home Office is confident the inquiry can both gain an understanding of historical failings and make recommendations to ensure unacceptable practices are not repeated without a need to consider every instance of undercover policing, wherever it was taken."	The Scottish government has ordered an independent review of undercover policing in Scotland.
Richard McAuley, 42, from Townhill Road in Portglenone pleaded guilty to the murder of Denise Dunlop, aged 32. The fatal stabbing occurred in the living room of Ms Dunlop's Centuripe Avenue home in Ballymena last June. The court heard that as a result of the attack, the couple's daughter suffered a "complex and traumatic experience". McAuley was told by the judge, Mr Justice Weir, that he had caused "enormous and permanent harm" to his daughter. The court heard that prior to the attack, on the evening of 14  June,  Ms Dunlop and McAuley had gone to her father's house. As they made their way back home in a taxi accompanied by Ms Dunlop's step-mother, the taxi stopped at an off-licence where alcohol was bought. When the taxi arrived back at Centuripe Avenue, Ms Dunlop's seven-year old daughter returned home from the babysitter's and they watched football on the TV. A row between the couple then broke out - possibly over an ice cream that was given to the girl - which resulted in what Mr Justice Weir described as "mutual pushing and pulling". As Ms Dunlop sat on the sofa, McAuley went to the kitchen where he armed himself with a knife. He returned to the living room, where he stabbed his partner three times in the upper body in front of their daughter and Ms Dunlop's step-mother. A wound to her chest, which passed through her left lung and heart, proved to be the fatal injury. Mr Justice Weir said the killing was "senseless" and told McAuley his actions had deprived a young girl of her mother. Saying the row was "fuelled by drink and drugs", the judge said a young woman had died in a row which was "almost unbelievable in its triviality". Since murdering Ms Dunlop, the court heard McAuley had made the case that he acted as he did due to provocation. However, the judge said that while he accepted the couple's 13-year relationship was on and off - largely due to McAuley's substance abuse - there was no history of violence between the couple, and there was "no justification" for McAuley's actions. Mr Justice Weir told McAuley: "You are a powerfully built man of six feet one, while the deceased was a foot shorter. There was no excuse for bringing a knife into this silly domestic dispute. "The deceased was very drunk, and the prescription drugs she had taken would have made her intoxication worse. She was no threat to you." The judge also told McAuley he did not believe his claims that he did not intent to kill Ms Dunlop, and that the knife attack was carried out in front of their daughter and Mrs Dunlop "without a thought for the consequences for them." The court heard McAuley has 44 previous convictions.	A County Antrim man who stabbed his partner to death in front of their seven-year-old daughter has been given a minimum 12-year sentence.
Gwent Police was called to the incident near Raglan Services at about 11:30 BST on Sunday. The ambulance service said a patient had been taken to Bristol Royal Infirmary. The road was closed in both directions between Monmouth and Raglan for about four hours but police said traffic was now moving freely.	A person has been taken to hospital by air ambulance following a serious crash on a major road in Monmouthshire.
Australia centre-back Wright, 24, has been with Preston since 2009 and his existing contract expires in 2017. "We'd like to have him tied down, he's been good for us, but the football club has been very good to him as well," Grayson told BBC Radio Lancashire. "I'm sure there'll be some more talks. It's something we'll try and resolve." Wright has made 20 appearances in all competitions so far this season, helping Preston to their current position of 11th in the Championship. Grayson added: "I think Bailey owes the club a lot. But whatever outcome will be, will be. "If he leaves on a free, then so be it, because we've brought in some decent free transfers over the past few years as well who have turned out to be good signings for us. "But while he's here, he'll still be considered to play."	Preston North End manager Simon Grayson says defender Bailey Wright "owes the club a lot" and hopes he will agree a new deal with the Championship club.
The 58-year-old school principal from Dublin won 144 out of a possible 278 votes and was 98 ahead of his nearest rivals Sean Walsh and Frank Burke. Horan will take over from current president Aogan O Fearghail in 2018. "Aogan is the president for the next 12 months so I'll support him and learn from him as best I can," said Horan at Croke Park. The other candidates for the post were Martin Skelly with 22 votes while 20 went to Robert Frost. This weekend's annual congress will be dominated by new championship proposals in football and hurling. The plans put forward by GAA director general Paraic Duffy include completing the All-Ireland Senior Championships by the end of August. Also included is a new round-robin format for the All-Ireland SFC quarter-finals, which would mean more games. This proposal has proved particularly controversial in recent weeks. Both the Gaelic Players' Association and recently formed Club Players' Association have come out against Duffy's plans, although not necessarily for the same reasons. Ostensibly, the main reason for these mooted changes is to try and ensure more regular games for club players but there is a certain  amount of bafflement as to how this can be squared with the motion to have a round-robin stage in the All-Ireland Football quarter-finals. The new club players' body has been angered after the GAA's top brass refused to grant it a speaking platform at the Croke Park gathering. However, that may change at further annual gatherings of GAA delegates if a motion for the club players' body to be officially recognised is passed in Dublin. All the indications are that the votes on both the so-called new 'Super Eight football round' and the proposal to bring forward the All-Ireland finals will be exceptionally close, with a two-thirds' majority required for the format changes to be tried for a three-year period. To make matters even complicated, congress will also hear a number of motions calls from the two-thirds majority to be scrapped, with one call suggestion a simple majority and another calling for the figure to be lowered to 60%. Inevitably, those motions will require a two-thirds majority to be passed. Going into the weekend, Croke Park's desire for replays to be scrapped - in favour of extra-time - in all championship games bar provincial and All-Ireland finals looks likely to be comfortably passed. At last year's congress, motions to move All-Ireland Finals to earlier in the year and scrap replays were both defeated, although the finals proposal fell narrowly short after getting support from 60.8% of delegates.	John Horan easily won the vote at Congress on Friday night to become the GAA president-elect.
The government is currently negotiating with the Lib Dems and Greens to strike a deal to get its budget plans passed. Green co-convener Patrick Harvie has asked for concessions over tax, while Lib Dem Willie Rennie has targeted up to £400m of additional spending. Finance Secretary Derek Mackay has said he is "positive" about winning support. With the SNP a minority government, they will need at least one opposition party to help the budget pass, either by voting for it or by abstaining. Mr Mackay has indicated a budget deal with the Conservatives or Labour is unlikely, but said there was "room for manoeuvre" in talks with the Lib Dems and Greens. And while he has said no matters are "absolutely closed", he wants to "adhere as close to the [SNP] manifesto as possible" on tax, making a deal with the Lib Dems the more likely. The Lib Dems said they wanted "substantial changes" made, which would "set Scotland on a stronger, more liberal path". These focus on the party's manifesto pledges around education and mental health. Specific measures include: Mr Rennie said: "Liberal Democrats will not agree to the draft budget as it stands and will need these substantial changes. If we don't get what the country needs then we will walk away. "Our plan invests for a step change in mental health and a transformation in education that will help in the road to a liberal Scotland. A properly funded pupil premium and more money for colleges will create that opportunity and boost jobs and the economy. "New investment in mental health services will boost this Cinderella service and make the whole NHS more sustainable in the future. We have also included support for alcohol and drug services, a higher budget for the police and lower cost transport for the Northern Isles. "I have had a number of meetings and discussions with the finance secretary so far and I am looking forward to receiving his response to our plan." Mr Mackay has defended his tax and spending plans in two meetings of the finance committee, where he also took questions from the public over social media. The committee will submit its report on the budget on Friday 27 January, with the first chamber debate on the budget the following week. The final vote on the budget will follow a separate vote on Mr Mackay's tax proposals, in the week beginning 20 February. This is a decent snapshot of what the final budget deal is likely to look like. Willie Rennie probably won't get absolutely everything he is asking for - one would suspect Derek Mackay is too good a negotiator for that - but this is a far more palatable list of demands for the finance secretary than that put forward by the Greens, who want to see some movement over tax. While he says nothing is off the table, Mr Mackay isn't going to budge on tax. He sees his current proposals as well-balanced, and endorsed by the electorate last May. And with a deal with Labour or the Tories more or less dismissed in advance on political grounds, that leaves Mr Rennie as the clear favourite. He may well have beefed up his demands accordingly - minus any red lines, of course, over tax. There are plenty of talks still to come, but there is also plenty common ground here. Expect a SNP/Lib Dem coalition to usher an amended budget through come the end of February.	The Liberal Democrats have set out funding for education, mental health and transport links as their demands for backing the Scottish budget.
Adrian Brown, 38, experienced a "severe psychotic episode" when he stabbed Muhammed Ali on a London Overground train on 12 December 2016. Judge Deborah Taylor QC ordered that Brown should be detained indefinitely. She added he would only be released on the order of a judge or the government. Brown, of Brockley Rise, south-east London, appeared via video link from Broadmoor Hospital during the hearing. A jury found Brown not guilty following a two-day trial at Southwark Crown Court. He was also found not guilty, by reason of insanity, of possession of an offensive weapon and of assault by beating of Mr Ali. The trial heard Brown had been delusional in his belief he would "save humanity" and exorcise a Muslim demon haunting him by stabbing his victim. The court was told he was heard by other passengers to say "Where are all the Muslims? I am going to kill all the Muslims", before holding a knife to the throat of another woman, who was unhurt. Brown accepted carrying out the attack but pleaded not guilty to a charge of attempted murder on the grounds of insanity. Mr Ali had been travelling home with his wife when the assault took place between Honor Oak Park and Forest Hill, south London. He told court that the attack had left him too frightened to leave his house. "I struggle to sleep at the time because every time I shut my eyes I have flashbacks to the whole thing", he said. "I can only assume it was me because my wife was wearing a headscarf." Detaining Brown indefinitely under section 37 of the Mental Health Act, Judge Taylor said: "You have a long history of psychotic illness and on that day you were suffering and you continue to suffer from paranoid schizophrenia. "There's no doubt that if it had not been for the prompt intervention of an off-duty police officer and two medical practitioners that he he may well have died such were the severity of his injuries and the loss of blood."	A man with schizophrenia who repeatedly stabbed a train passenger after yelling "I want to kill all the Muslims" has been found not guilty of attempted murder by reason of insanity.
The Bournemouth striker, who has been included in a 27-man final squad, has yet to receive official clearance from Fifa to play for the country of his parents. The 23-year-old has represented England at youth level since 2005, having captained the Under-12s, won the Victory Shield with the U16s, and turned out for the U17s, U19s and U21s. Afobe is expected to join up with his prospective teammates next week in Kinshasa, but Fifa is yet to approve his application to switch nationality under world football's governing body regulations. According to the rules, players who have represented one country at junior level can play for another at senior level if they meet the qualifying stipulations. He holds dual nationality and has not played for England's senior side, making him eligible for the Leopards - once an application has been made to Fifa and approved. Afobe, who moved to Bournemouth from Wolves for £10m in January, has scored four goals in 10 appearances for the Cherries so far this season. The former Arsenal striker scored 23 goals in two seasons with Wolves. Meanwhile, the DR Congo squad will officially commence their preparations at Béatrice de la Gombe hotel in the capital on 20 March. They are currently third in Group B after a home win over Madagascar and a shock 2-0 defeat at Central African Republic in September. CHAN winner Florent Ibenge, who also guided DR Congo to third place at last year's Africa Cup of Nations in Equatorial Guinea, is desperate for positive results against group leaders Angola. Only group winners are guaranteed automatic qualification to the 2017 tournament in Gabon. The Leopards have also progressed to the final round of qualifying for the 2018 World Cup.	Ex-England youth international Benik Afobe will not play for DR Congo in next weekend's 2017 Africa Cup of Nations clash with Angola.
In a strongly worded letter to all teachers, Gavin Boyd also said they got better pay than their counterparts in England and Wales. Teaching unions are refusing to co-operate with school inspections in a dispute over pay and workload. Some are also taking occasional strike action. The National Association of Schoolmasters and Women Teachers (NASUWT) has reacted angrily to Mr Boyd's letter, accusing him of "fake news". Mr Boyd is chief executive of the Education Authority and represents the teaching employers in negotiations over the current pay dispute. He wrote that the industrial action was "seriously affecting the education of children and young people" and "the effective operation of schools". He also said teachers had been "confused by misinformation" on a number of issues. "The average teacher's pay in Northern Ireland is just over Â£40,000 per annum," he added. "This compares very favourably with other graduate professions locally and is actually higher than the average teacher's pay in England and Wales." He said that teaching unions had rejected an overall offer of 2.5% on pay in 2015-16. "There have been no reductions in teacher's pay," he said. Mr Boyd conceded that national insurance and pension contributions had risen, but said these were "part of a wider government strategy to ensure public sector pensions remain affordable and sustainable". "Public sector pensions remain attractive and in general offer much better terms than those available in the private sector." However, the NASUWT's general secretary Chris Keates said his letter would infuriate teachers. "Teachers will not be persuaded or intimidated by the fake news presented in the letter," she said. "The value of teachers' pay has fallen by around 20% since 2010. "The employers should start to devote more of their time to addressing the genuine concerns of teachers rather than peddling misinformation." The letter will not help to resolve disputes between teachers and their employers, said Heather Watson, the principal of Phoenix Integrated Primary School in Cookstown, County Tyrone. She was "shocked, confused and disappointed" when she received the letter. "It hasn't done anything to reassure teachers that they are respected and valued," said Ms Watson. "I understand that there are two sides to this, but I really want the two sides to get their act together and address the issues." Jim Clarke, the chief executive of the Council for Catholic Maintained Schools, which represents teachers' employers, said the information in the letter was "factually accurate". "It might not necessarily agree with everyone's perspective but all we can do is present the facts as they are," he added. In a related development, the Irish National Teachers' Organisation (INTO) has accused the Department of Education of "attempts at bullying" by writing to a Catholic archbishop about the ongoing industrial action. In a letter to members, INTO said that the Department of Education's permanent secretary Derek Baker had written to Archbishop Eamon Martin. They said Mr Baker had requested that Archbishop Martin ensures that school governors co-operate with school inspections. "Attempts at bullying, such as this, should be rejected as an unsubtle attempt to bring the action to an end," they wrote. However, in a statement to the BBC, the department responded by describing the claim as "utter nonsense". "The letter focuses exclusively on the statutory duty placed on governors in respect of safeguarding and promoting the welfare of pupils and seeks their cooperation with the ETI specifically in respect of child protection and safeguarding," they said. "The suggestion that the department's letter amounts to bullying is utter nonsense".	Northern Ireland's top education official has accused teachers of harming children's education by taking industrial action.
The move would reverse a long-held policy of not naming alleged war criminals in the Syrian conflict. Investigators said on Friday there had been an "exponential rise" in atrocities committed in Syria. UN figures show that more than 220,000 people have been killed during Syria's four-year civil conflict. The investigators - from the UN's Commission for Inquiry on Syria - said they had prepared five lists of names including "a variety of perpetrators from different groups". The Commission refused to say how many suspects were named, but diplomatic sources told the BBC there were approximately 200. The Syrian government has carried out innumerable air strikes on rebel-held territory throughout the conflict, and has been accused by human rights organisations of killing thousands of innocent civilians in the process. The UN's High Commissioner for Refugees says more than nine million Syrians have been displaced as a result of continuing fighting. Speaking after a briefing of the UN Security Council on Friday, a spokesperson for the Commission said that they were "weighing the pros and cons" of publishing the lists of suspects. The BBC understands that if they decide to publish the lists it will coincide with the UN Human Rights Council meeting in Geneva on 17 March. In a report published on Friday, the Commission stressed that both the Syrian regime and the main Islamist militant groups active in Syria - Islamic State (IS) and al-Nusra Front - had committed atrocities, as well as other smaller factions. The report warned that despite the Commission's "long-standing position" not to name suspects, maintaining that policy would "reinforce the impunity" of alleged war criminals. Speaking on Friday, investigators said that they had increasingly been sharing information with countries to enable them to prosecute their own citizens for crimes committed in Syria. They revealed that four of the lists of names of alleged war criminals had been passed to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and a fifth would be handed over in March. The five lists, compiled since the Commission began investigating in 2011, are understood to contain approximately 30 to 40 names each. The death toll for 2014 from the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights is just the latest grim statistic from years of war. Syria's refugee crisis Conflict in numbers Noting the rise in atrocities over the four-year conflict, the Commission's report said the scale of war crimes in Syria "raises questions about the inadequacy of the response of the international community". A spokeswoman for the Commission said that the UN Security Council "was not acting" despite damning evidence of human rights abuses. "We expect really after four years that something must be done," she said.	United Nations investigators are considering revealing the names of an estimated 200 individuals suspected of committing war crimes in Syria.
For the six months to June, net profit jumped to a record $1.1bn (Â£660m) from $873m one year ago. Revenue rose by 24% to a record $3.5bn, due to higher sales volumes. The company also benefitted from a new pricing regime at its Pluto LNG project off the Western Australian coast. The price for LNG from Woodside's Pluto facility increased by 36%, and this rise was reflected in its customer contracts during the six months to June. Woodside - Australia's biggest oil and gas producer - operates six out of the seven LNG "processing trains"- also known as purification facilities, that are available in Australia. In a statement released with the earnings, chief executive Peter Coleman said: "Our record production is a testament to our assets' ongoing reliability. Our half-year profit was up 27 per cent on the same period as last year, reflecting our record production, higher realised prices and increased sales volumes." The company did not offer any guidance for the rest of the year. But it did reaffirm its recently raised production target of 89 to 94 million barrels of oil equivalent (mmboe). Mr Coleman said the firm's international exploration strategy was also taking shape, with new acreage in Myanmar as well as entries into Morocco, Tanzania and Gabon. Woodside's international portfolio includes interests in Ireland, New Zealand, Canada and Timor-Leste.	Australia's Woodside Petroleum has seen a 27% jump in first half profit, mainly driven by higher prices for its key product - liquefied natural gas (LNG).
Naz Shah has apologised for sharing the graphic showing Israel's outline superimposed onto a map of the US with the comment "problem solved". It was shared in 2014, before she became Bradford West MP. The Board of Deputies said the post, highlighted by the Guido Fawkes political website, was "appalling". The graphic said relocating Israel would be a "solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict", and that it would allow Palestinians to "get their life and their land back". In a statement, Ms Shah said: "This post from two years ago was made before I was an MP, does not reflect my views and I apologise for any offence it has caused." Labour confirmed she had stepped down as Parliamentary Private Secretary - an unpaid backbench assistant - to shadow chancellor John McDonnell. In a second statement, the MP said: "I made these posts at the height of the Gaza conflict in 2014, when emotions were running high around the Middle East conflict. "But that is no excuse for the offence I have given, for which I unreservedly apologise." She said she would be expanding her "existing engagement and dialogue with Jewish community organisations and will be stepping up my efforts to combat all forms of racism, including anti-Semitism". The Board of Deputies of British Jews said the comments were "simply appalling", calling for an urgent meeting "for clarification of her views on Israel and the UK Jewish community".	A Labour MP has stepped down as an aide to the shadow chancellor over a Facebook post suggesting Israel should be moved to the United States.
The couple, who have been dating since 2011, wed in front of about 10 people in Mazan, Provence - close to where the bride's family has a holiday home. Mayor Aime Navello told the Associated Press he married them at the town hall. The short service was followed by a reception for family and friends, reported to have included Righton's bandmates and actress Sienna Miller. Knightley, 28, announced her engagement to Righton, 29, last year. "Keira was a charming bride, very modest and simple in her attitude, as was James," Mr Navello told the Daily Mail. "I got the impression that it was a very moving experience for both of them." The actress, who was Oscar-nominated for her performance in 2005's Pride and Prejudice, is the daughter of playwright Sharman Macdonald and actor Will Knightley. She rose to fame in the British hit Bend it like Beckham, becoming an international star in films including Love Actually and the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise. 'More interesting' Knightley also won critical acclaim for her performances in films such as Atonement, A Dangerous Method and, most recently, Anna Karenina. Later this year, she will be seen in Jack Ryan - a prequel to previous Tom Clancy adaptations - playing Cathy Ryan opposite Chris Pine. Singer and keyboard player Righton has performed with indie rock band the Klaxons since 2005. The group won a Mercury Music Prize in 2007 for their debut album Myths Of The Near Future. In an interview last month, Knightley said she did not want an extravagant wedding day. "We're not 'big wedding' types. I don't need to have all that. I'm just trying to enjoy the engagement bit. "My parents are together after 40 years. The fights are there but they love each other. "It's not like the first three months, the first two years... whatever it is, but I think it gets more interesting, or I hope so."	Actress Keira Knightley has married Klaxons star James Righton in the south of France.
Bertrand Traore, playing as a central striker, gave the Blues the lead when he took Nemanja Matic's pass, turned and fired home from 20 yards out. The Potters deservedly levelled when Xherdan Shaqiri's cross was punched by Chelsea keeper Thibaut Courtois to Diouf, who headed into an empty net. Bojan almost won it for the Potters in injury time but Courtois denied him. Stoke remain seventh in the table, with Chelsea 10th - three points behind them. The Blues named a team with Wednesday's Champions League game against Paris St-Germain in mind. Striker Diego Costa, who had a minor tendon injury, was not risked, while midfielder Cesc Fabregas was left on the bench. Burkina Faso forward Traore started centrally, with recognised strikers Loic Remy and Alexandre Pato on the bench, and his goal was the one real moment of quality in the game. He found space outside the box before firing a great shot past Jack Butland - his fourth goal in five games. However, he had a mixed game, failing to control the ball in the box on a couple of occasions and being caught offside needlessly. He was replaced after 68 minutes by Remy, who made little impact. Chelsea could have had a penalty when Marc Muniesa leaned on Oscar in the box but there were only muted appeals for a spot-kick. The Potters had won their previous three Premier League games and started the day five points off the Champions League places. Mark Hughes named an attacking line-up at the home of the soon-to-be dethroned champions, with Ibrahim Afellay, Shaqiri and Marko Arnautovic starting behind Diouf. When Bojan replaced Glenn Whelan, they had five forwards on the pitch. And just when it looked like their luck might be out - Courtois had done well to deny Shaqiri and Arnautovic - they got their reward. With Joselu waiting on the touchline to replace Diouf, the Senegal striker headed home after Courtois failed to adequately deal with Shaqiri's cross. That was his last touch. Hughes told BBC Sport: "That's the bit of luck you need. He put a great shift in. He was looking a bit tired so I thought I'd freshen it up. Luckily he scored just before I brought him off." Stoke boss Mark Hughes told BBC Sport: "We're grateful to equalise but we deserved more from the game. It was an excellent away performance - we took the game to Chelsea. We were encouraged by the team they picked. Media playback is not supported on this device "I was a bit surprised with their team. I thought they had a chance to get in the Champions League. "We're really pleased with the performance. Their goal came out of the blue, it was a great bit of individual skill. I felt we were a strong team and made things happen." Chelsea interim boss Guus Hiddink told BBC Sport: "Stoke play well and creatively and they pushed us back. The first goal we got after a sloppy start, it was a beautiful goal. "We should have got a penalty for a foul on Oscar. Any referee would have given a free-kick if it was outside the box. That was a key point. Stoke got some encouragement after that. Media playback is not supported on this device "We have rested one or two players but it's good to see the players who came in, especially the young ones, like Traore and Ruben Loftus-Cheek, do well. "Everyone knows in December we were one point off the relegation zone. There was a little bit of panic. Through a lot of draws at the beginning, we moved away and then we had to make the next step with victories, which we did." Chelsea's next two games will have more of an impact on their chances of winning a trophy than the Stoke fixture. On Wednesday, they try to overhaul a 2-1 first-leg deficit against PSG in the Champions League last 16, while next Saturday they go to Everton in the FA Cup quarter-finals. Stoke's next game is at home to Southampton next Saturday. Match ends, Chelsea 1, Stoke City 1. Second Half ends, Chelsea 1, Stoke City 1. Attempt missed.

Mr Tohti is an economics scholar who has criticised Beijing's policies towards the Uighur minority. He has been detained since January, after he condemned the government's response to a suicide car attack in Tiananmen Square. The United Nations, the EU and US have all called for Mr Tohti's release. He denies the charges against him. Mr Tohti, 44, is being tried at the Intermediate People's Court in Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang. Prosecutors presented evidence alleging that Mr Tohti advocated that Xinjiang should be made independent. Their evidence included testimony from his former students. Mr Tohti was teaching at Beijing's Minzu University. Mr Tohti has rejected the evidence, and his lawyers say that his students' testimony were made under duress. One of his lawyers, Li Fangping, told Reuters news agency: "Most of the students said Professor Tohti had separatist goals or intentions... We believe they weren't trustworthy statements, that they were made under pressure." Seven of his students, said to have been working on an Uighur website which Mr Tohti managed, were arrested shortly after he was detained. Guzaili Nu'er, Tohti's wife, attended the trial with several of his brothers and appeared distraught, according to AFP news agency. "He has never opposed the country or any ethnic group," she was quoted as saying. "He has never done anything like that." Human Rights Watch, in a statement, said Mr Tohti had "consistently, courageously and unambiguously advocated peacefully for greater understanding and dialogue between various communities, and with the state". "If this is Beijing's definition of 'separatist' activities, it's hard to see tensions in Xinjiang and between the communities decreasing," said its China director, Sophie Richardson. Reports said the court building and surrounding streets were sealed off, with dozens of police officers standing guard, some in riot gear. Foreign journalists were not allowed inside and while some courts release details of proceedings via official microblog accounts, the Urumqi court has stayed silent. The Associated Press reported that several Western diplomats were prevented from entering and witnessing the trial. Police blocked views of the court building with tall panels promoting an upcoming trade event in Xinjiang. The trial is set to continue on Thursday. Xinjiang, which borders Central Asia, is home to the Muslim Uighur minority group. In recent years the region has seen rising tensions between Uighurs and Han Chinese migrants. Violence has increased in recent months, with deadly attacks on civilians in Urumqi and the southern city of Kunming. Last year, three Uighurs drove a car into pedestrians in Tiananmen Square, killing two people and themselves. China blames these attacks on Uighur separatists inspired by overseas terror groups. But Uighur activists say increasingly repressive Chinese rule is stoking tensions and fuelling violence. The most recent violence took place in July in Yarkant, killing 96 people. State media say police shot 59 attackers after an armed group stormed government offices, killing 37 civilians. Activists say police opened fire on people protesting against a Ramadan crackdown on Muslims. Critics say that the prosecution of Mr Tohti risks silencing moderate voices and will make the situation in Xinjiang worse rather than better, reports the BBC's Martin Patience in Beijing.	Prominent Uighur academic Ilham Tohti has gone on trial for separatism in China's far western region of Xinjiang.
Stac Lee rises to 172m (564ft) above the North Atlantic and Stac an Armin to 196m (643ft). St Kildans harvested gannets and great auks from the cliffs of Stac an Armin. St Kilda's last 36 residents left the islands in the 1930s. At the weekend, Assynt Mountain Rescue Team members Bob Kerr, of Portskerra, and Tim Hamlet, of Achiltibuie, climbed to the summits of both sea stacks. The pair, who were among 12 climbers working together, managed to make their climbs during a spell of fine autumn weather. Mr Kerr said the dry conditions made negotiating droppings left by thousands of seabirds on Stac Lee a little easier. He said: "The ascent up and along the exposed ledges and the summit slope involved stepping on and moving up through abandoned gannet nests. "Thankfully there had been a period of relatively dry warm weather in the days before this trip and this resulted in the guano in the nesting areas being fairly dry and stable. "We would not enjoy ascending these slopes if the guano had been wet as it would have been excessively slippery." Once on the top of Stac an Armin, the two climbers were able to take in clear views of St Kilda and the Western Isles. Mr Kerr said: "The views across the entire St Kilda archipelago were awe inspiring as Boreary, Stac Lee, Stac Levenish, An Dun, Hirta and Soay could all be seen from the one spot. "The hills of Harris were also visible on the far horizon."	The remote archipelago of St Kilda is home to the UK's highest sea stacks.
George Verrier was treated by officers who were called to an altercation involving about 20 people in Bromley in the early hours of Sunday. He did not want to be taken to hospital, said police, but was found unconscious several hours later in nearby Ferndale. He died in hospital. A 17-year-old arrested on suspicion of murder has been released on bail. The Met said it had voluntarily referred the actions of officers who went to the scene to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) for assessment. A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: "At this early stage it appears the victim suffered a head injury as a result of the altercation. "Inquiries continue to establish the full circumstances of the incident." George, a trainee electrician, was injured in Southborough Road at about 00:45 BST, while on his way home from the party in adjacent Blenheim Road. Police were called at about 09:30 BST to a home in Ferndale - about a mile away - after he fell unconscious. He was taken by air ambulance to hospital where he died at about 18:00 BST. He had been due to have his first driving lesson on Tuesday. Cornelius Moran, whose 16-year-old daughter was having the party, said: "He was a good friend of my daughter's. A lovely boy from what she tells me. "My thoughts are with the family." A woman who lives near the party venue, but did not wish to be named, said: "It looked like a very well-organised party - it was noisy, that's all. "The family who had the party are such a nice family." Another neighbour said some partygoers had been turned away from the house. He said: "We were very much aware of the noise. That stopped at about 12.30am when the music stopped. "My wife was looking out of the window and she could see three large adults leading a group of youngsters up the road, turning them away from the party."	A 17-year-old boy has died of head injuries following a fight after a party in south-east London.
Michael Tovey, 27, formerly of Lakes Road, Erdington, Birmingham is accused of using two drones to fly contraband into HMP Birmingham last year. In the first charges of their type brought by West Midlands Police, Mr Tovey faces 13 counts of conveying banned items into a prison. He is set to appear at Birmingham Magistrates' Court on 7 June. Read more news for Birmingham and the Black Country Mr Tovey is accused of using two drones to drop contraband into the prison's exercise yard on 29 October and 6 November. He attempted to drop a consignment near N and P wings containing four phones, SIM cards, Black Mamba, steroids and cannabis, it is alleged. It is claimed he was also responsible for a drone that crashed into the same yard eight days later, carrying two phones and further quantities of the same banned drugs.	A man has been charged with using drones to smuggle cannabis, steroids and mobile phones into prison.
Cpl James Dunsby's body appeared to be "shutting down" on the Brecon Beacons in July 2013. The 31-year-old's temperature was 40.4C (104.7F) - well above a normal 37C. He was one of three reservists to die from overheating on the 16-mile (26km) march on a "boiling hot" day. Cpl Dunsby, from Trowbridge, Wiltshire, died at Birmingham's Queen Elizabeth Hospital 17 days later. L/Cpl Craig Roberts, from Penrhyn Bay, Conwy county, died at the scene and L/Cpl Edward Maher died about three hours later at Prince Charles Hospital in Merthyr Tydfil. The hearing has previously been told the exercise took place on one of the hottest days of the year, with temperatures expected to hit 27C (80.6F). In a statement on the seventh day of the hearing, Welsh Ambulance clinical team leader Damon James said he did not think L/Cpl Dunsby would survive. He said he was initially told on arrival there were three people "on the hill" in cardiac arrest. Mr James added he was approached by an Army officer who told him he was in charge. Mr James said: "He told me the male (Cpl Dunsby) had been on a four-day exercise and was half-an-hour from the finish. "He said the male had collapsed about 100 yards up the track. He said they had carried plenty of water but were pushing themselves to the limit." The hearing in the Solihull, West Midlands, was also told an unnamed walker was earlier asked by an Army officer to fan down Cpl Dunsby, hold his head and watch his breathing while four other soldiers carried him on a stretcher from the hillside. The inquest continues.	A paramedic with 23 years experience said a heat-stricken Army reservist who collapsed on an SAS test march had the highest temperature he had seen, an inquest has heard.
The final stretch of the $3.8bn (Â£3bn) pipeline is being built under a North Dakota reservoir. The Standing Rock Sioux and Cheyenne River Sioux tribes have filed a lawsuit against the pipeline, saying it endangers their drinking water. They also say the pipeline will damage sacred burial sites. The pipeline, when complete, is expected to transport about 470,000 barrels of crude oil a day from North Dakota to a terminal in Illinois, where it can be shipped to refineries. The developer, Energy Transfer Partners (ETP) has completed most of the pipeline, and began work on the final section after the army gave it permission to proceed on Wednesday. The Standing Rock and Cheyenne River tribes asked for a temporary injunction against construction, pending a lawsuit against the pipeline. They argued that the pipeline would hurt their water supply, and prevent them from practicing religious ceremonies at the lake. However, developer ETP and the army argued against an emergency injunction, saying there was time for the lawsuit to be heard before oil began to flow through the pipeline. Construction on the pipeline had stalled for months due to opposition from protesters. Thousands of predominantly Native American protesters have demonstrated against the pipeline's construction and set up camps along the final stretch. Nearly 700 people have been arrested since protests first began last year, according to law enforcement officials. The Obama administration announced in September that it would not allow the project to proceed, but Donald Trump overturned the decision in one of his first acts as US president.	A US judge has rejected a request from two Native American tribes to halt construction on the controversial Dakota Access oil pipeline.
The 22-year-old was born in Edinburgh but has not been involved in the Scotland set-up before now. Jones plays for Cape Town-based Stormers in Super Rugby and his preferred position is centre. He comes into Vern Cotter's 27-man squad after Glasgow Warriors fly-half Finn Russell pulled out after suffering a head injury. Jones said: "I'm delighted to get this opportunity to play for Scotland. It's a dream come true. "I didn't go out to South Africa with the intention of becoming a professional rugby player, but, as my career progressed, it become more of a realistic goal to play for Scotland. "The call came as a bit of a surprise, but I'm thrilled and can't wait to get to Edinburgh next month and play my part in an exciting squad." The Scotland newcomer was educated in Somerset, but his rugby career took off on a gap-year trip to South Africa in 2012. He stayed on and helped the University of Cape Town win the Varsity Cup in 2014, scoring in the final, before being called up for Western Province Under-21s. Jones progressed to the senior team before being called up by the Stormers, for whom he has made 21 appearances. Scotland play two Tests against Japan on 18 and 25 June, with BBC Scotland providing live television, online and radio coverage.	Scotland have called up South Africa-based back Huw Jones for their June tour of Japan.
The Australian singer, 48, and English actor Joshua Sasse, 28, announced their engagement earlier this year. The couple have been vocal supporters of the "Say I Do Down Under" marriage equality campaign. The government has proposed holding a public vote on same-sex marriage in February 2017. Mr Sasse, who helped launch the "yes" campaign at the weekend, said the pair would like a wedding in Melbourne, "but we will not get married until this law has passed in Australia". "When I found out that gay marriage was illegal in Australia, I was astounded," he told Australia's Seven Network. "I simply can't fathom on any level, whether it's moral or religious or anything, that I have the right to get married and to marry the person that I love and that somebody else doesn't because of their sexual orientation."	Kylie Minogue's British fiance has said the couple won't get married until same-sex marriage becomes legal in Australia.
Pre-tax profit fell 49.7% to Â£27.7m in the first half of the year ending 30th June, The firm said its focus for the period had been operational improvements, which meant its "financial performance would inevitably lag behind". Ladbrokes boss Richard Glynn said it was now "well positioned for growth". "We have made substantial progress. We now have the products, the platforms, the people and the brand in place to deliver," he added. Ladbrokes formed a tie-up with software developer Playtech last year and as a result switched its gaming products to a new system. The firm admitted the switch over had caused more disruption than expected, but said it was now complete. Ladbrokes said it had also completed the replacement of 9,000 of its gaming machines with more sophisticated models. It also closed 46 of its "under performing" shops in the first half, nearing its target of 50 for the year. It said further shop closures beyond this were "inevitable", but it was too early to specify the number. The firm said its performance in the UK was hit by "industry-wide customer friendly results" in both the January football and horse racing in June. And it said its adherence to the The Association of British Bookmakers (ABB) voluntary industry code of conduct had also had "a clear impact on revenues". The code, which enables players to set spend and time limits on gaming machines, aims to promote responsible gambling. However, it said its World Cup performance had been "strong" with bets on mobiles up 1,100%. "The board remains confident of the outlook for the business and in delivering a result in line with its expectations for the current year," it added. Shares in Ladbrokes rose 3% in early trading. Peel Hunt analyst Nick Batram said the fall in profit was in line with expectations. "The results are unquestionably poor but they are in line with forecasts. It's also a positive narrative from Ladbrokes in that it has focused on all the things it is implementing to put it right," he added.	Bookmaker Ladbrokes has reported a sharp fall in profit, despite saying it had had a "good World Cup" performance.
Payments have been stopped to the West London Vocational Training College and its students in the Welsh capital. Education Minister Huw Lewis said there were concerns over "unusual student recruitment trends". The college said as far as it is concerned, all of its students are genuine. The Cardiff branch runs various IT and business courses and has been designated as suitable to offer HND business courses, which attract tuition fees of Â£6,000 per student, funded by the Welsh government. Students on those courses can also apply for Student Finance Wales loans and grants. Week In Week Out has been investigating offers made by a local agent recruiting for the college. Some students have been told by him they can use faked documents to access those loans and grants and they do not have to attend regularly to get the cash. He also said if they do not go on to earn more than Â£21,000, they will not have to repay the money - which is true. The college has denied any knowledge of that scam. In a statement to AMs on Friday, Mr Lewis said: "Allegations have since come to light to suggest that one or more individuals within the college may have colluded with prospective students deliberately to defraud the student finance system by falsifying academic records and records of attendance at the college. "I would expect any allegations of criminal activity to be referred to the police so that they may be investigated fully." Pearson UK - which validates colleges - carried out a review of the Cardiff campus, visiting the site on 21 October. The education minister said that "no substantive concerns came to light at that time".	Payments to a college's Cardiff campus have been suspended after a BBC Wales' Week in Week Out investigation into fraud allegations.
In Dublin, a military ceremonial event was held at the War Memorial Gardens at Islandbridge. A military service was also held at the Mall in Cork. Irish President Michael D Higgins travelled to Thiepval in France to pay tribute to the Irishmen who died while serving in the British, Commonwealth or US armies. He was accompanied by the the Irish minister for arts, heritage and the Gaeltacht, Heather Humphreys. The village of Thiepval in France is close to where the 36th Ulster Division began their attack on German lines on 1 July 1916 and is now the site of the Ulster Memorial Tower, a 70ft (21m) monument which commemorates their sacrifice. Men from all over the island of Ireland fought at the Somme, and the service in France will also be attended by representatives from the British and French governments also. Many people from the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, including relatives of Somme veterans, have travelled to Thiepval for the commemoration event. The ceremony in Dublin began at 07:28 local time - the time the battle started 100 years ago. It was attended by members of the Irish Defence Forces and the Royal British Legion.	The centenary of the Battle of the Somme has been marked with ceremonies in the Republic of Ireland.
Newport's win over Accrington sees the Exiles leapfrog Pools, putting them two points in front with two games remaining. Victory for Barnet, under caretaker boss Rossi Eames, was only their second win in 13 games. But they controlled the match throughout against a side lacking in confidence, belief and ability. John Akinde was denied an opener after 12 minutes when his angled header was tipped over for a corner. From the set-piece Michael Nelson, the Barnet skipper, fired a shot against a post, while Jack Taylor's goal-bound shot was deflected wide. Nathan Thomas got Pools' first shot on target after 64 minutes, failing to test goalkeeper Josh Vickers. And the Bees went ahead in the 66th minute when Akinde turned and powerfully fired an angled drive past goalkeeper Joe Fryer. Simeon Akinola made it two five minutes later, the Bees racing away down the left side and Jamal Campbell-Ryce setting up the substitute. Akinde also missed a penalty, Fryer saving his weak spot kick with nine minutes remaining. Match report supplied by the Press Association. Match ends, Hartlepool United 0, Barnet 2.

The reaction to Taylor's death on Thursday at the age of 72, and the affection expressed for him, was the true measure of his standing inside and outside football. Born in Worksop in Nottinghamshire, Taylor was the son of a journalist and rose to prominence in the game as a manager after retiring as a player with Lincoln City in 1972. He became manager and coach at the club, winning the Fourth Division title with them before moving to Watford in 1977. It was here, in tandem with his chairman Sir Elton John, that he produced arguably his finest work, taking the club from the Fourth Division to the top flight in the space of five exhilarating years. Media playback is not supported on this device Taylor nurtured Watford legends such as Luther Blissett and John Barnes, remarkably finishing second behind Liverpool in their first season at that elite level and reaching the FA Cup final in 1984, where they lost 2-0 to Everton. Not so long ago he joked with me, with his usual broad smile: "You know I have never watched any of that game from that day to this - but I don't need to see it again to know that second goal from Andy Gray was a bloody foul on our goalkeeper Steve Sherwood." Taylor's unlikely partnership with the flamboyant rock star worked against the odds, the manager's down-to-earth approach dovetailing with his chairman's lavish lifestyle. They remained friends for life, as demonstrated by Sir Elton's heartfelt tribute. On trips abroad when he worked as a BBC Sport pundit, Taylor would gladly tell stories of that partnership, always with a laugh and underlining the genuine affection they shared. Taylor's brilliance inevitably attracted attention from elsewhere and, perhaps feeling he had achieved all he could at Vicarage Road, he left for Aston Villa in May 1987. Villa were in reduced circumstances having been relegated to the second flight. Taylor soon put that right by winning promotion in his first season - and, not content with that, rebuilt the club with such success and shrewd management that he took them to second place behind Liverpool in 1990. Taylor's methods were tried and trusted and yet he often received criticism for what his detractors perceived as "long ball" football. He, with much justification, pointed out his willingness to use wingers and flair players such as Barnes and the young Mo Johnston, whom he brought to England from Partick Thistle. England inevitably looked in Taylor's direction after Sir Bobby Robson left following the 1990 World Cup in Italy, where his side lost to West Germany on penalties in the semi-final. Media playback is not supported on this device This was, without doubt, the darkest and most frustrating period of Taylor's career and is one of the reasons his other work has been so criminally underrated over the years. Taylor took over at a tough time after the loss of England mainstays such as goalkeeper Peter Shilton and past captains such as Terry Butcher and Bryan Robson. He gave players like Alan Shearer and Martin Keown their first England caps - but he drew criticism for selecting players many simply felt were not international class, such as Carlton Palmer. England reached Euro 92 in Sweden under Taylor but produced a series of disappointing performances, going out at the group stage after losing 2-1 to Sweden in Stockholm. Taylor courted controversy and criticism in that decisive game by substituting England captain and main marksman Gary Lineker for Arsenal striker Alan Smith with a goal still needed - it never arrived and Lineker never played for England again. The manager was vilified and lampooned as a "turnip" in the Sun newspaper. The campaign to qualify for the World Cup in the United States in 1994 also ended in failure, and was brutally chronicled in the fly-on-the-wall documentary 'The Impossible Job', which gave an intimate insight into the pressures Taylor was under. Those struggles were illustrated starkly in the game that effectively sealed his fate, the 2-0 loss to the Netherlands in Rotterdam. He may have operated at the highest level but he never talked down to supporters and was always interested in how they viewed the game The tortured Taylor is seen on the sidelines pleading with officials after Ronald Koeman somehow escaped a red card for a foul on England's David Platt, only to be reprieved and score the brilliant free-kick that sent the Dutch on the way to victory. He resigned the following month and stayed out of the game until returning at Wolves in March 1994. During his spell in charge he took them into the second-tier play-offs in 1994-95, where they lost to Bolton Wanderers. Taylor left in November 1995 before returning to revisit old glories. Sir Elton John was back at the helm at Watford so it was no surprise when he turned to Taylor to come back to Vicarage Road as general manager in February 1996. It was once more the perfect fit and he was back as manager a year later, winning the third-tier title in 1998 before putting Watford in the Premier League at the end of the following season after a play-off final victory over Bolton. Media playback is not supported on this device Watford, despite an early win at Liverpool, were relegated and the following season Taylor decided to retire - only to change his mind and make a comeback at Villa in February 2002. He retired for a second and final time after they struggled the following season. It was the end of one chapter and the start of another as Taylor became a respected pundit on BBC Radio 5 live, a role he performed with total assurance and perception. Taylor was part of the radio team that covered England. It was a sign of the esteem in which he was held by fans as well as players that whenever he encountered supporters abroad, he was treated with complete respect. There was barely a reference from England followers to any of his struggles in charge of the national team. To them, Taylor was a true gentleman, to be given his due not just for his work but for his warm personality and willingness to discuss football matters with anyone he met. He may have operated at the highest level but he never talked down to supporters and was always interested in how they viewed the game. As a BBC Sport colleague, Taylor was unfailingly co-operative and the consummate professional, willing to take a call at any time, even when he was meant to be spending time with his beloved wife Rita. And as well as a fount of knowledge and a man with strong opinions, Taylor was also an endless source of entertainment and stories, just as happy to poke fun at himself as everyone else. Graham Taylor was a top-class manager at club level and a true gentleman inside and outside of football. He will be greatly missed and perhaps now his work in management, viewed through the prism of this sad news, will finally get the credit it fully deserves.	Graham Taylor will be remembered by many for his unfulfilling spell in charge of England - but by plenty more as an outstanding club manager at Watford and Aston Villa and one of the nicest, most genuine men in the game.
A group of about 400 people, made up of the 15-year-old's friends, relatives and neighbours, took part in the Wear Pink for Paige walk on Saturday. The walkers stopped at the spot in Clydebank where Paige's body was found and a single balloon was released. John Leathem, 31, has appeared in court charged with murdering Paige. He was fully committed for trial at Dumbarton Sheriff Court on Friday. He made no plea or declaration and was returned to custody. Paige's body was found in a wooded area just off Great Western Road in Clydebank at lunchtime on 21 March. The teenager was last seen near a deli in the town before setting off for her part-time hairdressing job. Hundreds of people gathered for a memorial event a Clydebank park on Saturday 26 March. The Titan Crane in Clydebank was also illuminated pink in memory of the teenager.	Hundreds of people have paid their respects to schoolgirl Paige Doherty by walking through the streets of her home town wearing pink.
Residents and an official said the victims were travelling in a pick-up truck that was targeted in the Hiran district of Hajja province. They had been heading to a local market, according to the residents. There was no immediate comment from the coalition, which is fighting the Houthi rebel movement in a bid to restore the internationally recognised government. The coalition says it does not target civilians, but the UN says air strikes have caused the majority of the more than 4,125 civilian deaths recorded since the conflict in Yemen escalated in March 2015. Wednesday's incident comes two days after a 48-hour cessation of hostilities ended. Both sides accused each other of repeated violations of the truce, which brought a brief respite from air strikes for residents of the rebel-controlled capital, Sanaa. Fighting continued in and around the south-western city of Taiz throughout the weekend, however, and on Tuesday clashes there reportedly left 11 people dead. Military officials said pro-government forces had repelled an attack on Taiz's western outskirts by Houthis and allied security personnel loyal to former President Ali Abdullah Saleh. The International Committee of the Red Cross expressed alarm on Tuesday at the situation in Taiz, where some 300,000 people have been under siege by rebel forces for more than a year. "Sniper fire and indiscriminate shelling has trapped civilians. Dead bodies are in the streets and people are unable to attend to their most basic needs. The situation is desperate," said the ICRC's head of delegation in Yemen, Alexandre Faite. Mr Faite added that the main hospitals in Taiz had reported receiving an average of 200 wounded in three days. Many patients were suffering from blast injuries and had to have limbs amputated.	Twelve civilians are reported to have been killed in a Saudi-led coalition air strike in north-western Yemen.
The 8ft guitar statue has been erected in East Park, where he worked as an attendant before gaining musical fame working with David Bowie in the 1970s. Ronson led Bowie's backing band, Spiders From Mars. He died in 1993, aged 46, after developing liver cancer. His sister Maggie Ronson said: "He absolutely loved his gardening job so this couldn't be more perfect. "We're very, very happy and I'm sure he'd be very proud." More on this and other stories from East Yorkshire and North Lincolnshire Councillor Mary Glew, who unveiled the sculpture at a ceremony, said it was "a fitting tribute" to the musician who "left an enduring legacy to the world of contemporary music". The sculpture was designed by 18-year-old Hull College student Janis Skodins, whose artwork was chosen in a competition. It has been installed in the Michael Ronson Garden of Reflection, near the park's pavilion. The sculpture is among 100 plaques and memorials honouring notable people across Hull for its City of Culture celebrations. Fellow musician Trevor Bolder is also due to be honoured. As well as working with Bowie, Ronson recorded several solo albums, the most successful of which was Slaughter on 10th Avenue, which reached number nine in the UK album chart. He also played on, produced or arranged songs for artists including Lou Reed, Bob Dylan, and Morrissey.	A sculpture honouring Spiders From Mars guitarist Mick Ronson has been unveiled in his home town of Hull.
Yorkshire, Lancashire and Derbyshire have been worst affected, after 2-5cm fell overnight, with 10cm reported on higher ground. Passengers waiting to depart Manchester Airport have reported being stuck on the runway for hours due to a lack of de-icers. Leeds Bradford Airport suspended all morning flights but has since reopened. Manchester Airport reported "minor delays to departing aircraft" -  but passengers told the BBC they had been stuck on board outbound flights. Shirley Hale said her Jet2 flight to Tenerife had been waiting to depart for over four hours. "We have been told that there are not enough de-icers at the airport," she said. The airport apologised and said de-icing was the responsibility of airlines and their ground teams. More than 100 schools were closed across East Lancashire and Oldham, with 80 shut in West Yorkshire. BBC Weather said Buxton in Derbyshire saw up to 17cm of snow, the deepest measured on Friday. The avalanche risk in the Peak District was currently extremely high, Buxton Mountain Rescue Team said. Parts of Staffordshire have been affected, with several centimetres of snow reported in Flash, England's highest village. Commuters have been urged to allow extra journey time, and the Met Office has issued snow and ice warnings. More on the snow and other stories in West Yorkshire Weather updates for Lancashire and Greater Manchester BBC Weather presenter Kay Crewdson said conditions were due to slowly improve into Saturday. Molly Greenwood reported 10cm of snow in the Huddersfield area. "Don't think I'm going anywhere," she said. Zulfi Hussain said the snow was causing "traffic chaos" in Woodhall Road, Calverley, near Leeds. Elliott Hudson, another West Yorkshire resident, said: "Looks like I have woken up in Narnia." West Yorkshire's Liversedge FC, who have had to cancel every home game for the last four months due to bad weather, tweeted a picture of snow with the caption: "It's not looking good for Liversedge FC's home game with Worksop Town tomorrow." The A628 Woodhead, A57 Snake Pass and A537 Cat and Fiddle roads are all affected, with delays reported on the M65 motorway. Highways England said the A57 eastbound in Great Manchester is closed between M67/A560 and B6174  due to severe weather conditions. It said teams were working to clear the road. Tony Hallwood, from Leeds Bradford Airport, said it reopened at about 09:00 GMT after crews used ploughs to clear snow from the runway. He said: "We are asking passengers to make their way to the airport as early as they can given the difficult conditions." Bus operators are also reporting delays to all services across West Yorkshire. Oldham Council has said 48 schools had closed this morning as a result of the snow and severe weather. Drivers are also being asked to take extra care after snow fell overnight in some parts of Northern Ireland. A Met Office yellow warning for ice and snow in northern England and Wales ended at 15:00.	Heavy snowfall has caused travel disruption in parts of northern England.
The screenplay has been written by Eric Roth - who won an Oscar for Forrest Gump. Leakey is former head of the Kenya Wildlife Service and was key to stemming the trade in illegal ivory. "I've felt a deep connection to Africa and its culture for much of my life," said Jolie. Leakey's extreme measures to tackle poachers, including sending helicopter gunships into the national park, have helped Kenya's elephant and rhino populations recover from the brink of disaster. He made international headlines in 1989, when a stockpile of 12 tonnes of ivory was burned in Nairobi National Park. Jolie said Africa is about "a man drawn into the violent conflict with elephant poachers, who emerged with a deeper understanding of man's footprint and a profound sense of responsibility for the world around him". Producer David Ellison - whose company Skydance co-produced films including True Grit and Jack Reacher - called Leakey "inspirational," adding, "Africa is a story that deserves to be told". Jolie's next movie, Unbroken, starring British actor Jack O'Connell is due in cinemas later this year. She is currently directing and starring opposite her husband Brad Pitt in the film By The Sea, based on her own screenplay.	Angelina Jolie has signed up to direct Africa, a film about celebrated conservationist Richard Leakey's battles with ivory poachers.
The caves have been digitally reproduced as part of the city's first Festival of Caves. The tour will take in Mortimer's Hole under Nottingham Castle and King David's Dungeon - caves some people would not be able to access. The city has more than 500 man-made sandstone caves which have been used for dwellings and jail cells. Nottingham City councillor, Dave Trimble, said: "There are plenty of local people who don't know about the hidden world beneath their feet." He said the new virtual reality tour would allow visitors who were unable to descend the steep steps into the caves to experience them. Andrew Whitney of Hot Knife Digital Media, which developed the tour, said: "We've taken very accurate data to digitally reproduce the caves in a gaming environment. "We're excited to bring the caves into the 21st Century using the latest gaming and virtual reality technology, increasing the accessibility of these sites to everyone." A series of caves has been found in the past six years due to funded projects such the Nottingham Caves Survey, which mapped and laser-scanned many of them. The festival runs until 23 October.	Nottingham's network of caves has been turned into a virtual reality tour, to open them up to a wider audience.
Media playback is not supported on this device Malan targeted South Africa's seamers, striking 12 fours and two sixes in a 44-ball knock as England posted 181-8. Chris Jordan took 3-31 and Tom Curran - in only his second game - 2-22 to restrict the Proteas in their chase. AB de Villiers made 39 and Mangaliso Mosehle 36 off 22 balls but South Africa could manage only 162-7. England, returning to the venue of their Champions Trophy semi-final defeat by Pakistan, put in a professional performance to wrap up the series. Middlesex left-hander Malan, 29, made the highest score by an England player on T20 debut, beating Paul Collingwood's 46 in England's maiden match in this format in 2005. England, whose next white-ball series is not until September against West Indies, begin a four-Test series against South Africa on 6 July. It was a polished performance from England's bowlers, using the short ball to discomfort South Africa, and they were backed up by some strong fielding. Hampshire leg-spinner Mason Crane, who played in the opening T20 at Southampton, was put under pressure as de Villiers struck him for consecutive sixes. However, the 20-year-old showed admirable confidence as he continued to toss the ball up and was rewarded when he drew an error out of the tourists' skipper, who slapped the ball to Alex Hales on the deep square leg boundary. Crane rounded off his spell with a superb over, conceding only two runs as England turned the screw. The Proteas were lacklustre. Of the top six, only De Villiers and opener JJ Smuts (29) reached double figures and it took some big hitting from wicketkeeper Mosehle to push their total up. England's seamers were excellent, with Curran in particular showing a maturity at the end of the innings as he bowled full and straight. The result means the visitors have won only two of their six limited-overs matches on this tour. England captain Eoin Morgan chose to rest himself for the match, a decision that initially drew criticism given this was a must-win game for England, but big-hitting Malan adapted quickly to international cricket. Arriving at the crease after Jason Roy fell for eight, Malan left his first delivery but pulled the second ferociously into the stands for six. On a pitch tinged with green, he took on the short ball against the seamers. He did not let up against a change of pace, nonchalantly flicking leg-spinner Imran Tahir over his shoulder to bring up his half-century from 31 deliveries. Malan and Hales, who was struggling to run after edging the ball on to his knee, put on 105 in 10.3 overs. When Malan finally fell, caught at long-on off Tahir, stand-in captain Jos Buttler struck two flat sixes to push England above 180. Media playback is not supported on this device The manner in which England went about such a calm and assured victory will be more heartening giving the changes they made to their side. As well as Morgan being rested, England gave Crane another opportunity, as well as Curran. For South Africa, it was a disappointing return, given how strong they were in the closing stages at Taunton. They were sloppy in the field to begin with. Andile Phehlukwayo's drop to reprieve Hales on 13 was so surprising the batsman had turned to walk back to the pavilion. South Africa will take some comfort in the performance of right-armer Paterson, who was twice on a hat-trick in the final overs thanks to his mixture of yorkers and slower balls. However, it was England who controlled the majority of the game. England stand-in captain Jos Buttler: "Dawid Malan was fantastic on debut. It is not easy to come in and show that much composure under pressure. On debut it was a fantastic effort. "Mason Crane, for a 20-year-old, has got great character. He was bowling at one of the best players that have ever played the game on a ground with a short boundary. "It was very tough on him but all credit for having the bravery and guts to keep going and get the wicket. I am sure he will remember it for a long time. "We have found some really great players. You find out a lot about players - international cricket is different and those guys have stepped up. Tom Curran was brilliant for his two games. "Taunton is not an easy place to make your debut and he took three wickets and two today. He looks a real find." South Africa captain AB de Villiers: "We were outplayed in both of these series. Well done to England and Eoin Morgan in the majority of the games, and Jos Buttler today, for leading them. "England put in an all-round better performance today. We were not far off but it was disappointing. "England do have some really good youngsters. They have good depth and all round are a really good team. "They seem to be going through a good patch and have a lot of talent. They have a bright five to 10 years ahead of them." On Mason Crane: "I was always going to go after him. Well done to him for sticking to his guns." Dawid Malan, who was named man of the match: "It is a fantastic experience to play for your country and to contribute in a win like that on debut is fantastic. "I thought this day might never come. I had a chat with Adam Voges, who played later for Australia. "I asked what he did and how he kept motivated when you keep getting overlooked for younger and younger players. He gave me some advice and fortunately I had a good Lions series and got picked when players were rested."	Dawid Malan hit an aggressive 78 on debut to help England beat South Africa by 19 runs and complete a Twenty20 series victory in Cardiff.
Finance ministers have endorsed the move, which is to be completed by the end of the summer. The European Commission says nations on the tax blacklist should be sanctioned if appeals for change go unheeded. The leak of millions of files from Panama law firm Mossack Fonseca revealed how the rich and powerful use tax havens to hide their wealth. Full coverage: Panama Papers Plans for a single EU list of "non-cooperative jurisdictions" have been blocked in the past by conflicting national interests. Currently the 28 EU states have different national lists of tax havens and can decide individually whether to impose restrictive measures. Negotiations on the new common list are expected to be complex and the number of jurisdictions to be included remains unclear. Ministers have also agreed to exchange information on the beneficial owners of companies and the EU is planning a crackdown on banks and tax advisers who help clients hide money offshore.	EU nations have agreed to draw up a blacklist of tax havens in the wake of the Panama Papers leaks.
The new deal will see the 20-year-old striker stay at the club until 2019. Mead has netted 11 times in WSL 1 so far this season, including a hat-trick against leaders Chelsea, to help put her side in contention for the title. Despite being tipped for a first senior England call-up, she was not included in the squad to face Estonia in a Euro 2017 qualifier on 21 September. Sunderland have reportedly turned down a bid from Arsenal Ladies for Mead. "We're delighted that Beth has signed a new deal - she is one of the best young players in the country," Sunderland manager Carlton Fairweather told the club website. "Naturally, with a player like Beth, there has been interest from other top-flight clubs. So for us to secure this signing shows exactly where we want this club to be."	Beth Mead, the leading scorer in Women's Super League One, has signed a new four-year contract with Sunderland.
Her job brought her into close contact with Goebbels - one of the worst war criminals of the 20th century. She was one of the last surviving members of staff from the Nazi hierarchy, who only spoke about her experience later in life. In a recent documentary, she said she had known nothing of the murder of six million Jews during the Holocaust. In "A German Life", which was released last year, she said she felt no guilt - "unless you end up blaming the entire German population". Born in January 1911, Ms Pomsel worked as a writer for a Jewish insurance broker for a number of years during her late teenage years, before taking a similar job with a right-wing writer. Although she claimed that she had always been apolitical, she joined the Nazi party when they took power in 1933, in order to take a government job with German national radio. Her skill as a typist, she said, brought her to the role of Joseph Goebbels' secretary in 1942, during the war, when he was minister of "public enlightenment and propaganda". She described Goebbels as "a good looking man ... a bit short", who was always well-groomed and well-dressed - but arrogant. She said she was simply a secretary and knew little of the Nazi's brutal actions during the Holocaust. "The people who today say they would have done more for those poor, persecuted Jewsâ€¦ I really believe that they sincerely mean it," she said in interviews for A German Life. "But they wouldn't have done it either." But she always maintained that she did not share in the blame for the actions of her superiors. "I wouldn't see myself as being guilty," she said. "Unless you end up blaming the entire German population for ultimately enabling that government to take control. That was all of us. Including me." Her Jewish friend, Eva Lowenthal, disappeared in November 1943. Sixty years later, Ms Pomsel discovered she had died in the Auschwitz concentration camp. Ms Pomsel was captured by Soviet troops at the end of World War Two - and spent the following five years in detention camps, before rejoining German broadcasting in 1950, where she worked for the next 20 years. She would not speak openly about her time serving the senior Nazi official until a 2011 newspaper interview, and more extensively in the 2016 documentary. She passed away in Munich a few weeks after her 106th birthday.	Brunhilde Pomsel, the former secretary to Nazi Germany's propaganda boss Joseph Goebbels, has died aged 106.
The analysis of applications also shows big differences within the UK, with Northern Ireland youngsters the most likely to aspire to university. Within England, teenagers in London are the most likely to seek places. There are "eye-catching regional variations in demand", says Ucas chief Mary Curnock Cook. The big picture shows an across-the-board, long-term rise in young people seeking places on undergraduate courses, which seems to be recovering from a dip following the increase in tuition fees. But the figures from Ucas, based on 20 million applications between 2004 and 2013, show sharp differences behind the overall upward trend. About half of young people now apply for university places - in England this rose from 36% to 44% between 2006 and 2010. But whether a young person applies to university is heavily influenced by a number of factors, including social background, gender, ethnicity and where they live. There has been a big increase in applications from ethnic minority youngsters in England, particularly black teenagers, rising from 20% to 34% between 2006 and 2013. Chinese teenagers are the most likely to apply, followed by other Asian youngsters, with white teenagers the least likely to apply, with 29% seeking places. "Our new analysis of demand by ethnic group shows that white pupils at English schools now have the lowest application rate of any ethnic group. There has been significant growth in demand from black pupils," says Ms Curnock Cook, the Ucas chief executive. Nicola Dandridge, head of Universities UK, said the figures raised questions about "why young white men from disadvantaged backgrounds are increasingly unlikely to apply to university". "It is critical that universities continue their outreach work to ensure that anyone who has the ability and potential to benefit from a university education should have the opportunity to do so," she said. These figures show the proportion of young people in these ethnic groups who are applying - rather than the absolute numbers. Most applicants will still be white students, because it's a much larger group. For instance, Ucas says the Chinese figure is based on about 2,000 youngsters, compared with about 500,000 white youngsters. More youngsters from the poorest income groups are applying, but there are still significant gaps in terms of social background. Teenagers from the richest areas are more than four times as likely to apply to the most selective universities than youngsters from the poorest areas. Youngsters who were on free school meals are only half as likely to apply to university compared with the rest of their cohort. There are big geographical divides. In England, 42% of 18-year-olds in London apply to university, compared with 31% in the north east. London state schools have been commended for having the best results in England. Across the UK, Northern Ireland has a significantly higher level of applications than elsewhere, with 48% of 18-year-olds applying, compared with 31% in Wales. Gender remains one of the biggest factors in application rates, with females remaining substantially more likely to apply. In 2012 in England, 49% of women applied compared with 38% of men. All of these factors overlap, so that a woman from Northern Ireland is much more likely to seek a university place than a man from Wales and a white youngster from the north east of England is less likely to apply than a black teenager in London. Les Ebdon, director of the Office of Fair Access, welcomed the fact that the gap in applications between richest and poorest was narrowing. But Universities UK warned that the figures did not show applications from mature and part-time students, which have been hit by the increase in tuition fees. "Numbers of mature and part-time students have decreased considerably since 2010 and any further drop may have significant implications for potential students and the country as a whole," said Universities UK chief, Nicola Dandridge. A Department for Business, Innovation and Skills spokeswoman said: "These figures confirm that the desire to study at university remains strong, with application rates for 18-year-olds at near record levels. "Some challenges remain but no one should be put off going to university for financial reasons. Our reforms mean students do not have to pay fees upfront, there is more financial support for those from poorer families and everyone faces lower loan repayments once they are in well-paid jobs."	Black and Asian teenagers are more likely to apply to university than white youngsters in England, according to the Ucas admissions service.
The Hatters, a top-flight side 22 years ago, are 14 points clear at the top of the Conference Premier, a league they have been in since 2009 after 89 years in the Football League. Sweet told Late Kick Off East: "If you compare us to clubs that have been at a low level but are now in the Premier League and Championship - there are no boundaries for what we can achieve." Late Kick Off East will be assessing the impact of dropping out of the Football League and the difficulty of getting back up. The team will take a close look at Luton and Cambridge United, as well as the difficulties facing Northampton Town should they fail in their bid to survive in League Two. Watch Late Kick Off in the East of England on BBC One on Monday, 10 March at 23:20 GMT or on the iPlayer for seven days after Championship clubs Yeovil and Doncaster were playing non-league football as recently as 2002-03, while Premier League sides Swansea and Hull have played in League Two in the past decade. The Hatters have been a prime example of how difficult it is to come straight back up after dropping into the Conference. Their Football League status ended five seasons ago, brought on by a 30-point deduction for paying agents through a third party and failing to come out of administration. It was a third relegation in as many seasons for the stricken club. A consortium, fronted by TV presenter Nick Owen, who is now Hatters chairman, and with Sweet on board, took over the club in 2008 and have eradicated the mismanagement that exacerbated the team's swift decline. But while progress has been made in off-field affairs, four managers have tried and failed to win that elusive promotion. The Hatters are playing down the near-inevitability of succeeding this time around, but boss John Still would have to surrender a 14-point lead at the top of the table if the Bedfordshire club are not to go up automatically. "It means an awful lot more than just one league to us," said Sweet. "We feel it is the beginning of a resurgence. "We've done everything we possibly can, all the preparation is there, we just want to keep winning matches and for that green light to go. We think we can actually spin on a bit. "League Two is not the destiny of course, without appearing to be arrogant. "We took over the club in 2008 with the vision that we had 12 years to put it back into a position where we would be comfortable, where we feel our natural position in the pyramid would be. "That's not League Two - and that's no disrespect to League Two. We've served our time and I just think when we get back into League Two it will give us a bit more of an ambition." Late Kick Off will be on every Monday until the end of the season, covering the teams in your region. Get involved on Twitter @latekickoffeast	Promotion from the Conference Premier could start Luton Town's resurgence to the Premier League, says managing director Gary Sweet.

For weeks he has come under pressure to step down as investigations continue into allegations that his wife was paid large sums of public money for a job she did not do. But having won a battle with his centre-right party, what now are Mr Fillon's chances in the fight for the Elysee Palace? He will have his work cut out if he is to claw back the lead he once held in France's presidential race. The latest opinion poll on Tuesday placed him third, on 19%, several points behind centrist Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen of the far-right National Front. Mr Fillon has stuck fast to his hard-core base for the past six weeks, as an investigation into his wife's employment whipped up a storm around his campaign. As centrist supporters deserted him in droves, he barely blinked. When his campaign manager and senior spokesman quit, Mr Fillon brushed it aside. When dozens of MPs deserted him, he retorted that he would do without them all. When polls suggested that he would struggle to reach the second round run-off, Mr Fillon ploughed on, determined to show that he retained the support of his most loyal followers. In that sense, his management of the scandal seems to have been a success. Tens of thousands of people turned out in the rain to rally around him on Sunday. But his handling of the allegations against him, and the media attention surrounding them, have also marked a sharp change in tone for France's most establishment presidential candidate, with new tactics borrowed from the populist playbook. Sunday's rally was initially described by Mr Fillon as a protest against political interference in the judiciary. He has complained of an "institutional coup d'etat", suggesting that the Socialist government is behind the allegations currently being investigated. At press conferences recently he has presented himself as the victim a "political assassination", of a "lynching" by the media, and he has accused investigators of leaking only one side of the evidence in his case. Mr Fillon has said he will leave it up to the voters to judge him, not a "biased [judicial] process". But attacking the nation's institutions while running for office has not gone down well with some party colleagues. Former Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin, on French radio, called it "dangerous" and "irresponsible". The man Mr Fillon beat to become Republican candidate, Alain Juppe, accused him of leading the campaign into an impasse. "He had a wide open road before him," he said. "What a waste." There was a sceptical response, too, to the claim by Mr Fillon's team that Sunday's rally had drawn 200,000 people to the Trocadero in Paris. Several journalists remarked that the plaza only held around 35,000 people when full. The claim of 200,000 is still prominently featured on Mr Fillon's campaign website. There is now talk of a "Trumpisation" of the centre-right candidate, with several commentators and news outlets comparing him to the US president. It is a very different side of a politician many saw as calm, unruffled and rather phlegmatic; "impervious to demagoguery and exaggeration", as Le Monde put it. But will the same tactics work to win back the broader votes he needs in the election itself? Mr Fillon might claim legitimacy from the people, but he is still a risk for his party. He is due to appear before a judge on 15 March and says he expects to be placed under formal investigation. Attacking the media, government and judiciary might work with his most loyal supporters, but it has driven many other voters away. If this is the new face of Francois Fillon, some might wonder what that says about the future of French politics itself.	French presidential candidate Francois Fillon has avoided an abrupt end to his campaign by securing the support of his divided Republican Party.
Mr Walsh, on a visit to Ulster University in Belfast, said: "Without question, it will be an advantage." He would prefer that the UK abolishes Air Passenger Duty (APD). But, in its absence, he said carriers within his International Airlines Group (IAG) would "certainly look at what is on offer" from Stormont. Economy Minister Jonathan Bell has promised a decision on an air route development fund by the end of next month. Potentially, it could be a Â£4m incentive package to help fund important business and tourism connections. The Northern Ireland Executive could, on its own, scrap all APD, but it would cost it at least Â£55m to repay the Treasury in lost tax revenue. Mr Walsh - a long-standing critic of APD - said it was "unfair to ask Stormont to make up the gap", adding "the chancellor should pay for it." He also expressed potential interest in Bombardier's new C-Series aircraft, which has struggled for orders and put the company under huge financial strain. He said the smaller version - the CS100 - "is possibly an option" for his airlines operating at London City Airport. "People will watch its introduction into service (later this year)," he said. "If it can demonstrate it is not just a good aircraft on paper then it will get more interest."	A Stormont fund to attract new air routes has the backing of Willie Walsh, the boss of British Airways and Aer Lingus.
Born at Alltnacaillich, Strathmore in 1714, Rob Donn could not read or write and dictated his poetry from memory in later life. A wall hanging depicting scenes from his life and work is to be created in a project led by Strathnaver Museum and Mackay Country Community Trust. People living in and around Strathnaver are to be invited to help make the piece of craftwork. Donn's poetry continues to be celebrated and studied today. Some of his work has turned into music and performed at Glasgow's Celtic Connections Festival. Strathnaver Museum has been awarded Â£5,400 from the Heritage Lottery Fund's Stories, Stones and Bones programme towards the project.	A Gaelic bard is to be remembered in needlework.
Christian, 33, captained the side during this year's tournament and will be one of their two overseas players for the competition in 2017. He averaged 41, with a strike-rate of 159.51, as Notts Outlaws won nine matches in a row in 2016. "Dan is an explosive player who hits the ball miles and played really well for us," said head coach Peter Moores. "He's also been around the T20 scene and around cricket for a long time. He brings all that experience to us, as well as a real calmness under pressure." Christian has played 174 Twenty20 matches during his career, scoring 2,549 runs and taking 130 wickets. He made three half-centuries for Notts last summer and equalled Alex Hales' record for the county's fastest half-century in T20 cricket by reaching fifty off 16 balls against Leicestershire. "Anybody who has met Dan will know he's a brilliant team-man. He gives everything and expects the same from his team-mates," Moores added. "He likes to get on the front foot, to be aggressive and to play attacking cricket, which is exactly what we want in that form of the game."	Australia all-rounder Dan Christian will return to Nottinghamshire for next summer's T20 Blast.
Rakhmat Akilov reportedly ran from the scene still covered in blood and glass, and was arrested hours later in a northern suburb of Stockholm. He has yet to be identified by police, who have only said that the man in custody is a 39-year-old Uzbek national. Even so, a picture of the man allegedly behind the attack has started to emerge: someone who had failed in his bid to get residency, lost his job and was hiding from police who wanted to deport him. Bumping into a former colleague earlier this year, he revealed he was spending his days "sleeping and smoking". According to reports, he had left a wife and four children behind in Uzbekistan in order to earn money to send home. He had applied for residency in 2014, but had been informed in December 2016 that "he had four weeks to leave the country", police official Jonas Hysing said. He did not leave and, in February, was officially put on a wanted list. A few months earlier, it is claimed he had lost his job after falling asleep at work. He had been working in construction, and was employed by Pierre Svensson for several weeks late last year, helping on an asbestos removal project. Mr Akilov was, he said, "a reserved person". "He didn't stick out. He did his job. You can't say he was very sociable, we just told him what to do and he did it. He didn't speak much Swedish," he told news agency AFP. Mr Akilov was also described as not being particularly religious. One has suggested he "partied and drank", which goes against strict Islamic doctrine. "He never talked about politics or religion," one friend told Swedish daily Aftonbladet. "He didn't pray five times a day from what I know." A co-worker agreed, telling news agency Reuters: "He was like any normal guy." Online, it seems, it was a different story. His Facebook page - which has since been taken down - is linked to a number of extremists through friends and featured at least two propaganda videos linked to IS, one reportedly showing the aftermath of the Boston bombing. He also liked a page called "Friends of Libya and Syria", which says it aims to expose "terrorism of the imperialistic financial capitals" of the US, British and Arab "dictatorships". However, he was also a fan of pages dedicated to Playboy magazine and Russian tennis player Maria Sharapova. Despite all this, Mr Akilov was not considered a threat by Swedish security services, who dismissed him as a "marginal character", apparently on the fringes of larger extremist movements.	The main suspect of ploughing a truck into a department store in central Stockholm, killing four people, had been denied residency in Sweden and had expressed sympathy for so-called Islamic State (IS), police and reports said.

A chronology of key events:
The oil giant said the majority of the staff and contractor posts would go this year, with the rest expected to be lost by the end of next year. The job losses amount to about a fifth of BP's North Sea workforce. BP said it was taking the step in the face of "toughening market conditions" but added that it remained committed to the North Sea. The cuts are among 4,000 posts BP plans to shed from its global oil exploration and drilling business. The announcement comes a day after oil firm Petrofac said up to 160 UK jobs could go under a restructuring plan. Mark Thomas, regional president for BP North Sea, said: "We are committed to the North Sea and see a long-term future for our business here. "For example, in 2016, we are continuing to invest around $2bn of capital into North Sea projects and a further $2bn in running our North Sea operations. "This will sustain many hundreds of jobs both in BP North Sea and our supply chain going forward. "However, in toughening market conditions and given the well-documented challenges of operating in this maturing region, we need to take specific steps to ensure our business remains competitive and robust. "An inevitable outcome of this will be an impact on headcount and we expect a reduction of around 600 staff and agency contractor roles by the end of 2017, with the majority of these taking place this year. "We are speaking to our staff and agency contractor management and will work with those affected over the coming months." The UK government's Scottish Secretary, David Mundell, is expected to hold talks soon with the Scottish government's energy minister, Fergus Ewing, over the announcement. Mr Mundell said: "The UK government will work with the Scottish government to ensure help is provided to those affected, including through the Job Centre Plus network. "The UK government recognises the huge importance of the North Sea, to Scotland and the whole of the UK." First Minister job Nicola Sturgeon described the job losses in the North Sea as a "crisis" for those affected but insisted that the sector had a "strong future ahead". She said: "I think it is important to note and to welcome BP's continued commitment to the North Sea. "BP has reiterated today its investment plans, both in capital investment and operational investment in the North Sea this year and has said that it sees a long-term future for its business." She said she would ensure the taskforce, which was set up last year and is chaired by Lena Wilson from Scottish Enterprise, was doing everything it could for individuals facing the prospect of redundancy and the industry as a whole. Lewis Macdonald, Scottish Labour MSP for the North East of Scotland, said the job cuts were "another huge blow" for Scotland's oil industry. He added: "With so many jobs being lost in the north east, and no sign of a recovery any time soon, it is time to reconvene the oil summit held just under a year ago and for the SNP government to spell out what their strategy is for dealing with this major crisis." Scottish Liberal Democrat MSP for North East Scotland, Alison McInnes, said "real support" was needed from the UK government if the North Sea oil and gas industry were to overcome the challenges it faced. Maggie Chapman, Scottish Greens spokeswoman on social justice, said the "need for a plan to transition the Scottish economy away from dependence on fossil fuels" had become "ever more important". John Boland, from trade union Unite, said: "This morning's announcement shows the crisis which has gripped our oil and gas sector for over a year now is far from over.  It's another hammer blow for jobs and skills. "We need an emergency convention of all the industry stakeholders - government, employers and trade unions - to tackle this crisis so we have a safe and sustainable industry for the next generation." Aberdeen City Council leader Jenny Laing said: "This is very disappointing news and a sign of the continued difficulties facing the sector, but we welcome the commitment from BP that the company still sees a long-term future in this area and is continuing to invest heavily in the North Sea." Industry body Oil and Gas UK said the plummeting oil price had impacted heavily on activity across the UK Continental Shelf. Chief executive Deirdre Michie said: "While Oil and Gas UK cannot comment on the commercial decisions made by its members, companies are having to take very difficult decisions in what continues to be a challenging time, and we, as an industry, must be thoughtful and supportive of our colleagues who are being made redundant or facing uncertainty."	BP has announced plans to shed about 600 jobs from its operations in the North Sea.
Police said they were called to Wingfield Road, Alfreton, at about 03:55 BST on Monday, where the body was discovered. Detectives said the man had suffered head injuries and has not yet been formally identified. The road was closed in both directions and police have appealed for people who were in the area between 03:00 and 04:00 to contact them. Officers also want to hear from anyone who have noticed any damage to a car that could have happened overnight.	A man has been found dead in a road in Derbyshire.
If you wanted to know what was what in the on-going shambles at Dundee United then get yourself to the Phoenix in Nethergate, that was the message. The oracle would be there in his usual spot, left-hand side of the bar, stick, maybe a dog. You'll hear him before you see him; gushing with insight and invective on the downfall of his beloved Arabs. On Thursday lunchtime we arrived at the Phoenix; a Derek-free zone. "He's not about," says the barman, who neither knows nor cares about the travails at Tannadice. All of it goes in one ear and out the other when Del is in full flight. "He's away in Iceland," says a regular. "That's where he had his accident. Skied into a tree while dressed as Santa." There's black comedy in the tale of the mysterious Blind Derek and that's fitting given why we're in town. United fans are beleaguered as never before, but they're not beyond a bit of dark humour. Theirs is a miserable plight, but they can laugh at it, too. Walking down Nethergate there's a man who turns out to be a United fan waiting to cross the road. Is he going to Dens Park on Monday night to witness the possible humiliation of his team by their city rivals? "No," he says, deadpan. "I'm going into jail for the evening. I'll get more peace in there." Thursday was a dank day in Dundee; rain and a touch of sleet. Outside St Mary's parish church, there's a man herding people into his drop-in centre. A Dundee fan, as it turns out. A grandson of John Petrie who, as an 18-year-old, scored 13 goals in Arbroath's historic 36-0 Scottish Cup victory over Bon Accord in 1885. "United could do with him," he smiles. "I'm half expecting to see some of them coming in for divine intervention. Maybe it's too late for them now. Ah, you don't like to see it. I mean that. I don't want United to be relegated." The fatalism is everywhere. There are no dreamers knocking around in the Tannadice support. Nobody has even the faintest hope of a great escape for Mixu Paatelainen's side, who will be relegated if they do not win on Monday. Fans talk about the past, which was not always glorious, that's true, but it was better than the dreadful place the club is in now. There was a connection, a feeling of togetherness, but the bond has been lost. As you go about the city and talk to the supporters the message of the shattered link between the club and its fans repeats over and over again. There's refuge from the rain in the back of Groucho's Record Shop, owned by Alastair Brodie and managed by Frank Mills - a pair of United fans since they were kids. Frank is just back in the door from Tannadice. He went to buy his early-bird season ticket and did so with a heavy heart. He's going on Monday, too. He fears he'll see his team relegated, but he's going anyway. He remembers his grandfather bringing him to watch United play back in 1962 and since the 1970s he reckons he's missed half-a-dozen home games, tops. "When you think about it; 54 years a fan," he says. "What do I feel now? I felt real anger on Sunday when we lost to Hamilton. Today, it's just resignation. So many mistakes have been made, so many disgraceful performances. "We were relegated in 1995, but it wasn't like this. That team was 10 times the side this lot are. I look at them and it's baffling. No tactics, no heart. "Jackie McNamara had to go and Mixu's been a disaster after him. I've sat in the stand and thought, 'If only we'd paid the money for Tommy Wright'. Tommy Wright would have kept us up." United fans can pin-point the moment it all started to go wrong - February 2015, when Stuart Armstrong and Gary Mackay-Steven were sold to Celtic. Their last game for United was a 2-1 victory over Aberdeen in the League Cup semi-final. They were sitting fourth in the Premiership at the time, three points behind Inverness but with a game in hand. They'd put 10 goals on Dundee in two games. No side, Celtic included, had scored as many in the league as United had at that point - 46 in 23 games then as opposed to 34 in 34 games now. Everything unravelled quickly. "From the minute the two boys walked out the door you could see it go down the way," says Frank in Groucho's. "Other players in that team raised their game when those two were in the side and when they weren't there anymore they just went back to being ordinary." Jim Spence has been a beat reporter in Dundee for a quarter of a century and he agrees with the timeline. "Absolutely, that was the moment, that was the killer," he says. "When those two went, it ripped the heart out of the side." United sell, as most clubs sell. John Souttar and Nadir Ciftci; Ryan Gauld and Andrew Robertson; Armstrong and Mackay-Steven; Johnny Russell, Scott Allan and David Goodwillie. There comes a time, though, when you've got little left to sell, when you burgle your bank of youth once too often. The more people you talk to about United's demise the more one name pops up. It's not McNamara or any of his players. It's not Paatelainen or any of his. It's not the failed, almost slapstick, signings of recent times, though many of them come in for heavy flak, not so much for their lack of ability but their lack of spirit. No. Stephen Thompson, the chairman, is very much at the centre of the cross-hairs. We have to be balanced about Thompson, but you'll struggle to find anybody in Dundee who'll provide it. There's been some heady times on his watch, some wonderful football, some footballers that were the envy of the country, some cup finals. Thompson reduced the debt from around £7m to just a shade over £1m now - a soft loan. He has done good work, but perception is reality and the perception of the United fans is that Thompson has fallen asleep at the wheel and has to go. There's unanimity on this. Whether it's fair or unfair is a moot point, but the United fans see no future with him. Thompson has been in America this week, looking for investors, maybe even a buyer. He's prepared to sell up, but here again there is cynicism among the support. "Up to now I've been sat on the fence a wee bit on Thompson," says Frank at Groucho's. "But the last few weeks have been so dire that you have to question everything. We need change now. The impression we get is that he's lost interest in the club. He wants to sell? He'll not get the money he's looking for. No chance." Frank says a trip to Tannadice is in order. Go to the club shop, he says. A disabled fan called Andy arrives in the shop, hands over his £150 for his season book and starts talking. "Stephen doesn't communicate with us," says Andy. "The board of the club don't know us. The link that was there is broken. It was never like this before." Mike Barile, of the ArabTRUST, is also in the shop, collecting tickets for Monday night. Barile says his mates are reluctant to go to the game for fear of witnessing the ultimate embarrassment. He'll be there, though, and, with a laugh, he says he'll be singing the anniversary song, the ditty about the Dens Park massacre of 1965 - the 5-0 drubbing that United inflicted on their city rivals when Mike was only a kid. Barile is one of Thompson's biggest critics. He, and many others, want the entire board to go. "It's totally beyond redemption," he says. "I'm critical of him because I helped get Stephen's father [Eddie] in the door and I know what a decent man his father was. The support was split then between Eddie and wee Jim McLean, but they're not split now. Nobody is backing Stephen or [director] Mike Martin or any of them. "Look at the wall there. That's a picture of Finn Dossing. He scored the hat-trick when we beat Dundee 5-0. September 11, 1965. I was only eight. That was a lifetime ago. I've never known an atmosphere as bad as we have now. Even when we didn't have a particularly good team we still had a spirit. "Everybody was in it together back then and that spirit took us through the 1960s and into the 1970s when we had wee Jim's ambition and he made us believe that we could take anybody on. And that's gone now. Gone in the last couple of years under Stephen's custodianship. Since the Celtic two went, it's been one mistake after another." Barile picks his phone out of his pocket and dials a number, hands over the mobile and tells me to talk to the woman at the other end. It's a lady called Sundie Cabrelli, wife of the late Peter Cabrelli, a one-time United player of the 1940s. Sundie is 93 years young and is still a season-ticket holder. She's going on Monday. "Oh yes, you have to go," she says. She was a fan of Eddie Thompson - "a gentleman" - but not a supporter of Stephen - "I just find him distant". Sundie doesn't like to say a bad word about anybody, but she thinks that Stephen should move on for the good of the club. "It's as bad as it's been in my time," says Jim Spence. "You have a chairman who has lost the faith of the fans and you have directors who are now coming under scrutiny and they don't like it. "I know the chairman well, I knew his father well. I told Stephen what I'm telling you. He's got a war on his hands with the fans. A deep dark hole exists. "There are constant rumours about people who are interested in buying the club, but there's always a Walter Mitty-type living in a caravan in Penicuik who claims to be putting together a consortium. "Stephen wants money to get out, but I can't imagine that any big hitter will give it to him. The club has operating losses of nearly £1m and probably more than £1m next season. Where does it go from there?" It's a question that occupies the mind of every United fan. They know how it all went wrong. What they don't know is how and when - and if - it's all going to come right again. In the meantime, for some of them, there's the slow walk to Dens, like folk heading to the footballing gallows.	Word had it that Blind Derek had all the answers.
Steven Maclean bundled home the opener five minutes before half-time. The hosts, slacker after the break, had beleaguered striker Larnell Cole sent-off after he confronted the referee. Liam Craig sealed the win from the penalty spot with two minutes to play, before Graham Cummins finished a sumptuous stoppage-time move. And things got worse still for Caley Thistle after the match, with captain Gary Warren shown a red card in the tunnel. Saints remain five points clear of Hearts in fourth place, and closed the gap on third-placed Rangers, who play Aberdeen on Sunday, to three points. With game after game ticking past, Inverness' position looks increasingly perilous. Next weekend's trip to Motherwell, second-bottom on goal difference, is now seismic. This contest turned nightmarish for the hosts after a bright opening, but the truth is, given their predicament, Caley Thistle did not threaten St Johnstone's goal enough. Billy Mckay sent a shot over from close range. Alex Fisher nodded a diving header wide. Carl Tremarco miscued a volley. Greg Tansey did draw a save from Alan Mannus when he rasped in an effort from outside the box, but Richie Foran's side never looked likely to find the net. Their best opportunity came immediately after the Saints went ahead, when Tansey fed Cole, who seemed to panic in a terrific position and shot straight at Mannus. Cole's dismissal ended the contest when he appeared to be cautioned twice for challenging referee Stephen Finnie's decision not to award a foul. St Johnstone were merciless and could have had more. With just one win from their last 21 league games, Inverness look deep in trouble. Tommy Wright's side deserve so much credit. Saints were tactically brilliant, so strong defensively and ruthlessly capitalised on their man advantage. They took one of their few first-half chances when Michael Coulson broke down the left and sent a dangerous ball across the six-yard box. Owain Fon Williams could only parry into the danger area, Cummins' shot was blocked but Maclean followed up to force it home. They should have had another when Craig's superb curling corner flew all the way to the back post where Cummins slid in and somehow knocked it over from two yards. Craig, in his 300th appearance for the club, coolly converted a spot-kick after Cummins was tripped to seal the points. Cummins then slammed home after Miller danced around the area to tee him up, before Craig cracked the bar amid the late flurry. With a tendency to finish the season strongly, and just a three-point gap to Rangers, the Perth side look capable of something special this term. Inverness CT manager Richie Foran: "It is a tough time of the season to be sitting bottom, and I need real men to stand up to that, but not enough of them did that today. "It is pure luck we are still in it and it is only four points. I sound like a broken record but one win changes it - that is the truth. But I need braver players with more passion and desire. We controlled aspects of the game without having that ruthless edge to it. I don't think we believed today. "The main person who is not good enough is me. I am obviously not doing my job right and big apologies to the supporters. I believe we let them down today. Media playback is not supported on this device "It is not good enough. I pick the team, I pick the shape, I will take 90% of the blame for that but the players need to stand up as well." St Johnstone manager Tommy Wright: "We went in 1-0 at half-time without playing particularly well but looked a threat. We looked comfortable enough and then after the sending-off, we were ruthless. We scored two and maybe could have scored two or three more. "The attitude to go and kick on and make sure we got that second goal, to make sure we weren't having any problems in the last few minutes, was excellent. "It's been a week that didn't start so well that's ended absolutely magnificently for us. We enjoy defending. We don't panic when we're under pressure. We're a good side that can do both sides of the game. "There's a better chance tonight (of finishing third) but we're not going to get carried away. We'll just keep working away. It keeps us five ahead of Hearts. It was an important result." Match ends, Inverness CT 0, St. Johnstone 3. Second Half ends, Inverness CT 0, St. Johnstone 3. Attempt missed.

The package includes a Â£250 Carer's Bonus for those looking after others for 35 hours a week or more. Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood called for a northern powerhouse for Wales in a speech at Bangor University. Meanwhile, Defence Secretary Michael Fallon visited Wales to meet business leaders. Also on Thursday, Wales Green leader Pippa Bartolotti called for the legalisation of cannabis for medical use in a speech in Cardiff. Speaking of the Lib Dems' plans, Mr Clegg said: "Our new Carer's Package will ensure society pays back the service that carers give to their loved ones and the community, easing the pressure they are under, and providing the support needed to live happier, more fulfilling lives." As for Plaid Cymru's call for a northern powerhouse, Ms Wood told students: "Devolution from London cannot stop at Cardiff Bay - there must be a devolution dividend for all Wales, for all communities. "This is especially the case for those furthest away from the capital. Wales is a community of communities."	Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg has unveiled measures to help people providing unpaid care for family and friends as he campaigns in mid Wales.
The body will also be responsible for the registration and regulation of youth support workers and work-based learning practitioners. They join more than 75,000 school and further education teachers and learning support staff on the national register. The council's chief executive Hayden Llewellyn said regulating all these groups was a "world-first for Wales". He added it was "a bold and welcome step". "By bringing non-formal and in-work education in line with formal education, we are enhancing the status of the often overlooked professions of youth work and work-based learning and the increasingly important role they play in young people's wellbeing and education," Mr Llewellyn said. Keith Towler, chairman of CWVYS (Council for Wales of Voluntary Youth Services), said good quality youth work "saves young lives". "The trusted relationship between young people and youth workers and youth support workers is vital for the development of resilience, self-esteem and delivery of professional responses to a huge range of issues," Mr Towler said. "Recognition of informal and non-formal learning in a wider educational context is important and this will support the development of quality youth work provision." Julie James, minister for skills and science, said the new registration system "supports our ambition to achieve the highest possible professional standards throughout the whole education sector and it will provide a vital component in ensuring the people of Wales receive high quality learning throughout their lives".	Wales' youth workers will be regulated by the Education Workforce Council for the first time from 1 April.
The world number two won 6-2 6-0 in 66 minutes and will next play Rafael Nadal, who beat Stan Wawrinka 6-1 6-4. It was a much improved performance from Murray, who broke 10th seed Raonic's serve five times. Jo-Wilfried Tsonga beat Roger Federer 6-3 2-6 7-5, and fellow Frenchman Gael Monfils beat Marcel Granollers 6-2 6-4. "It's the most challenging surface for me every year," said Murray. "It normally takes me a few weeks to remember what I need to do, how to move, the way to build up the points and making sure you don't rush." Murray needed almost three hours to beat Benoit Paire on Thursday and had struggled for form since the Australian Open in January - but he was close to his best against Raonic. The Scot, 28, dominated all aspects of the game but was especially aggressive on the return, denying the big-serving Raonic a single ace and breaking five times. "The two most important shots in tennis I did really well," added Murray. "I was getting a good read on the serve and, when he missed the first serve, I was being very offensive on the second serve return and putting him under pressure. "The serve and the return for me were the best they've been for a while and I'm glad, because they weren't so strong the last couple of matches." Jamie Murray boosted his hopes of hanging on to the doubles world number one spot for a while longer as he and Brazil's Bruno Soares reached the semi-finals. The pair beat sixth seeds Rohan Bopanna and Florin Mergea 6-2 6-3, despite Murray requiring treatment on his thigh at one stage. Murray leads Marcelo Melo by just five points in the rankings and will face the Brazilian, and partner Ivan Dodig of Croatia, in the last four on Saturday. Andy Murray and Dom Inglot had a match point but could not convert as they lost 6-4 3-6 12-10 to France's in-form Nicolas Mahut and Pierre-Hugues. Never want to miss the latest tennis news?

Alexander Young crashed his Iveco Daily van into Andrew Nisbet's parked car on 25 November 2015. Mr Nisbet, 58, suffered fatal injuries when he was struck by his own vehicle Young pled guilty to a careless driving charge at Livingston Sheriff Court. The collision happened on the B7066 Whitburn Link Road near Polkemmet Country Park. The court was told that Mr Nisbet's car was parked with its hazard warning lights flashing when the accident happened. Young, 62, of Airdrie, North Lanarkshire, admitted failing to observe Mr Nisbet's car and colliding with it. Police said at the time that the van driver had suffered only minor injuries in the crash. Mr Nisbet, from Sauchie, Alloa, was married with a family. He was described him as "a much loved husband and father" who would be sorely missed.	A van driver who crashed into a stationary car, fatally injuring its driver, has admitted careless driving.
Some argue that Africans have never had so much artistic freedom, with a proliferation of books, paintings and films since the advent of multi-party democracy in the 1990s, and the huge advance in technology which has allowed anyone with a smartphone to publish their views across the world. But critics say artists are still subject to tight censorship, pointing out that a South African gallery was forced to remove a painting of President Jacob Zuma under political pressure, while in Uganda a play about gay rights was banned. So, just how free are Africa's artists - in film, literature and music- to tell their own stories? Here are some of their experiences: Having been born and raised in Uganda, it was the best place to be. It was my home and my everything. I remember joining the film industry in 1999 - everything was still good. You didn't need a licence to shoot a film, no censor body to look at your script. All you had to do was get a camera, run to the streets, shoot something and lock yourself in the edit suite - and later put your work out there for the world to see. Today, I have grown to understand that not all stories can be told and not just any film can be done here. There are topics you have to think twice before tackling or which, for your safety, are better left untold. Topics that will get even actors saying: "I think I am not the right person for that role" even when you know they can pull it off. Here, you don't just wake up to say you are doing a film about the gay community, a film about the political situation, or a film that paints a bad picture of Uganda. One day I had to drop a story that was inspired by the practice of female genital mutilation amongst some communities in Uganda. I had strong interviews and had done thorough research, but everyone kept telling me it was not safe to go ahead. But it is still my home, my Uganda, my everything. I don't think anyone is free to exercise their art. And that includes artists. There is a cost for this freedom. Artists are no different to the entrepreneur in that financial resources are required for the capital outlay of the "work" or manuscript. Just to be in a position to indulge in the work is time spent creating a product without the immediate benefit of financial return. Then the work needs to be produced depending upon the format and genre, requiring additional resources. In the case of a writer, it is then given to a publisher, who spends even more resources to fine-tune the manuscript with an editor, proof reader, type setter, graphic designer etc. which could take considerable time before it is placed on the retail shelf. Since the work now becomes a joint investment, compromise is inevitable. So, I guess artists are free to tell their story if they have the resources to indulge in this freedom. There is a preconceived notion and expectations regarding African films. Only in recent years have young filmmakers begun to break the mould and make more experimental films. Funders have a clear idea of the African films they want. In most instances, those that depict African people in an unconventional light are not the stories funders and international festivals want to see. They are content to see Africa as a struggling continent, which is corrupt and disease-ridden. Many urban African stories don't ever reach beyond Africa because of the question: "Are those really African stories?". The image and perception of African film is still very narrow. I want to tell African fantasy and surreal films, but the reaction is: "Why? Don't you have more important issues that you need to address in your films?" Each African film-maker has his own story to tell and we need to allow the "strange for Africa" films to co-exist with those that speak of identity, cultural and moral injustices, war, HIV/Aids etc. But things have changed slightly and filmmakers are finding alternative sources of funding - for instance, private investors - to tell stories they are passionate about. Are artists free to tell their own stories? This is a conscious choice each artist has to make. However, in the developing world, with most artists relying solely on their practice for their livelihood, they are forced to compromise their genuine stories with some "fabricated reality" that is sellable. This is further fuelled by the common perception that sales equal success, which leaves us caught up in creating fairy tales for sale. In oppressive environments, artists are intimidated and live in fear of censorship or consequences of defiance. In Kenya, having recently switched from the stereotypical African dictatorship that clamped down on creatives (mostly writers) to a more liberal government, artists whose work was inspired by bad governance, stemming from from semi-illiterate leadership, now have trouble remaining relevant. Tune in to the BBC World Service at 1900 GMT on Friday 1 March to listen to the BBC Africa Debate - Are artists free to tell their stories? - broadcast from Ouagadougou. Or take part in Twitter - using #bbcafricadebate -  Facebook or Google+ Africa Debate The whole funding situation further complicates the scenario. There's a big chunk of "development" aid and "human rights" funding channelled through non-governmental organisations. A handful of very prolific artists have gone mercenary. They've stopped making good art and have started championing the causes of civil society groups because the money is good. Artists are very free to tell their stories. A lot of factors may determine whether they do but in spaces with rampant poverty, very few can resist the temptation of a fistful of dollars to tell someone else's story. Artists just have to believe that their own stories are good enough. Filmmakers, unlike other artists such as painters and dancers, need money to practice their craft. And African filmmakers are especially burdened by a lack of money because our societies are financially strapped and they historically undervalue art. Our governments have different priorities and our businessmen see no financial value in supporting art. So African artists often find it impossible to tell their own stories. One way around that difficulty, I find, is crowd-funding. With many people making small donations, an artist can raise enough money to see through a vision that would otherwise be impossible to realise. That is how I completed my debut feature, Ninah's Dowry. But the lack of a speedy internet structure and limited access to credit cards still make crowd-funding a challenge on the continent. Another not-so-obvious deterrent to an artist's freedom is the requirement by some governments that artists submit scripts for approval before filming permits are granted. It is understandable for my beloved Cameroon, for example, to be touchy about military sites appearing onscreen. That is a credible national security issue. But, what happens if the artist's screenplay is critical of his government or country? Belonging to a very traditional society with conservative cultural values, I always have to make sure that what I say or what I do does not offend certain sensitivities. Which is not easy when you realise that the Festival in the Desert, while looking outward to the modern world, is organised by an indigenous people from a very traditionalist milieu. With the occupation of a large part of Mali and the prohibition of any form of artistic expression such as music, things became much more difficult. Expression itself was extremely risky because you exposed yourself to various punishments from the occupiers - including imprisonment. Even on the international level, to denounce what was happening could bring you trouble. At first you may be labelled as "an enemy of Islam" with all that implies in consequences for your daily life. However, this does not intimidate us because we are convinced that what we do is not against Islam. Our struggle is to show the values that are held by the majority of Muslims in the world, values of sharing and of tolerance. In its comparatively short history, African cinema has been viewed with considerable apathy and condescension both at home and abroad. No post-colonial African state in the continent has attempted to develop a cultural or film policy that incorporates critical debates, political and the poetic, since former Senegalese President Leopold Senghor's 1960s attempt with his idea of "Negritude". With funding intertwined in various governmental departments and international development resources, film-makers are often forced to avoid making films dealing with their immediate surroundings. Instead, they produce films that are neither critical of social problems and national politics nor entertaining. That said, digital storytelling has presented film-makers with essential tools to battle for the freedom to create and distribute their work. In the last 10 years, young Africans have brought amazing energy to drama by embracing digital technology and therefore producing work that has been able to reach its audience across multiple platforms providing film-makers the freedom to imagine and free from the global hegemony.	Fespaco, Africa's premiere film festival, is taking place in Burkina Faso this week, amid debate about artistic freedom on the continent.

Chasing 273, England collapsed from 100-0 to 164 all out, with Mehedi Hasan taking 6-77 and Shakib Al Hasan 4-49. They earlier dismissed the hosts for 296 after dropping four catches. Bangladesh had only beaten Zimbabwe and a weakened West Indies team in 95 previous Tests, but the 108-run win means the series finished 1-1. England needed their highest successful run chase in Asia and looked well set after a century opening partnership between Alastair Cook and Ben Duckett. But they lost all 10 wickets in 22.5 overs in the final session as Bangladesh secured the biggest win in their history. Bangladesh had lost 72 of their previous Tests and last played in August 2015 because of security concerns in the country. Duckett (56) scored his first Test half-century but was bowled by 19-year-old off-spinner Mehedi with the first ball after tea, prompting the stunning collapse - the third worst in history by a team who had been 100 without loss. Joe Root was lbw in the following over to Shakib, before Gary Ballance and Moeen Ali were dismissed in the same Mehedi over shortly afterwards. Cook made 59 but, despite successfully overturning one dismissal, the England captain was caught off Mehedi by Mominul Haque at silly point. Shakib then dismissed Ben Stokes, Adil Rashid and Zafar Ansari in quick succession. Fittingly, Mehedi took the final wicket of Steven Finn to finish with six in the innings, 12 in the match and 19 in the series. Openers Cook and Duckett, who batted together for the first time in the first Test in Chittagong, had only managed a best partnership of 26 in their previous three innings. Duckett, 22, impressed with an aggressive 56, hitting seven fours and a six, and played a number of reverse sweeps and pull shots. Bangladesh bowled all four spinners in the session leading up to tea but they took no wickets in helpful conditions. Cook had scored four, 12 and 14 in the series but also batted fluently in a period that seemed to swing the game in England's favour. England will rue their failure to take early wickets as Bangladesh added 116 runs in the morning session and Cook's side dropped four catches. Imrul Kayes scored 78 but was dropped at leg slip by Cook off Ansari, and then by Root off Moeen in the first 10 overs of the day. Both were difficult catches but Duckett dropped a simple chance at deep mid-wicket later in the session with Shakib the batsman to benefit. Finn also put down a difficult diving chance, while England chose not to review the umpire's decision on two occasions when replays showed the batsman would have been given out had they done so. Kayes' innings and 41 from Shakib helped Bangladesh to 268-7 at lunch, but Stokes (3-52) and Rashid (4-52) helped England knock over the tail in 26 balls after lunch. Media playback is not supported on this device Former England spinner Vic Marks on BBC Test Match Special That was extraordinary. I don't think I've seen a series where it's been impossible to know who's winning. At tea time we were praising Duckett and Cook, but less than two hours later the match was over. I've not seen the mood change between sessions like that before. Ex-England batter Ebony Rainford-Brent I feel emotional for Bangladesh. There were all these issues about security and there were doubts about the series taking place. The people here were all so happy that England came. This is unbelievable. Former Bangladesh all-rounder Athar Ali Khan That was a very special win for Bangladesh. I think 160 million people in Bangladesh will have been glued to the TVs, radios and phones. I feel privileged to be here to have seen it.	Bangladesh claimed their first Test win over England as the tourists lost 10 wickets for 64 runs after tea on day three of the second Test in Dhaka.
He suffered a stroke two weeks ago and his condition improved before a sudden deterioration on Tuesday. Mr Peres, who was one of the last of a generation of Israeli politicians present at the new nation's birth in 1948, served twice as the country's prime minister and once as president. He won the Nobel Peace prize in 1994 for his role negotiating peace accords with the Palestinians a year earlier. He once said the Palestinians were Israel's "closest neighbours" and might become its "closest friends". Obituary: Shimon Peres, Israeli founding father Long legacy of Israel's elder statesman Mr Peres died in a hospital near Tel Aviv early on Wednesday, with his family at his bedside. He had been in the intensive care unit of the Sheba Medical Centre after suffering a major stroke on 13 September. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed his "deep personal grief on the passing of the beloved of the nation". Meanwhile US President Barack Obama called Mr Peres his "dear friend" in a statement, and said: "He was guided by a vision of the human dignity and progress that he knew people of goodwill could advance together." Mr Peres shared his Nobel Peace Prize with Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who was later assassinated, and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. At the start of his long political career, he was put in charge of personnel and arms purchases for the Haganah, the predecessor of the Israel Defense Forces. He secured a deal with France to supply the new Israeli nation with Mirage jet fighters. He also set up Israel's secret nuclear facility. He was the defence minister in 1976, when Palestinian hijackers diverted a plane from Israel to Entebbe in Uganda. He oversaw the successful rescue of more than 100 hostages. Once an advocate of Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank, Mr Peres later became a leading political dove. He often spoke of the need for compromise over territorial demands in Palestinian areas. He maintained an active public schedule into old age, mostly through his non-governmental Peres Centre for Peace, which promotes closer ties between Israel and the Palestinians. In 2013 he said: "There is no alternative to peace. There is no sense to go to war." He retired from his role as president in 2014.	The former Israeli PM and president, Shimon Peres, has died aged 93.
Work was due to begin this week on demolishing Prestatyn Community Hospital which closed two years ago. But now National Resources Wales has ruled that because seagulls are nesting on the roof, the demolition must be put on hold until the chicks have  flown. Developers Pure Residential and Commercial have bought the site and lodged plans for apartments and houses.	Seagulls have come to the aid of campaigners fighting to save a former hospital from immediate demolition.
The firm said that it was working to boost capacity at telephone exchanges in the worst hit areas. The news coincided with the launch of Sky Go Extra - a service allowing users to download movies and TV shows so they can be watched offline. One expert said the product might add to the strain. Sky Go Extra still works at slow internet speeds - however, Sky's other streaming services rely on the user having a 2 megabit per second connection. Some subscribers have complained their download speeds have fallen below this level at peak times. A Sky spokeswoman apologised for the problems. "Following a combination of an underlying increase in network traffic as well as a high rate of new customer additions, we are aware of capacity issues in a small number of exchanges," she said. "We are working on adding new capacity to those exchanges as quickly as we can. We apologise to all customers who have been impacted by this issue." She confirmed a report by The Register that users in Doncaster, North Wales and Bristol were among those affected, but declined to be more specific or name other locations. However, the firm has provided an online postcode checking facility for its subscribers to check if their local exchange has been flagged as having an issue. Sky also indicated that less than 5% of its broadband customer base used the affected exchanges. Andrew Ferguson, editor of the Thinkbroadband news site noted that Sky had recently run a major promotion highlighting the fact it did not place "fair use" caps on the amount of data its customers use. As a result, he said, the firm had probably attracted subscribers who downloaded significantly more than the average 23 gigabytes per month consumed by the average UK broadband user. "Sky had this problem last year in some of its exchanges, and it's definitely not the only service provider to have experienced this problem," he told the BBC. "It's very much related to the firms' promotional activities. Sky has also been pushing its fibre products recently - they offer higher speeds and people who sign up generally use more data afterwards."	Sky has acknowledged that some of its customers are experiencing slow internet speeds as a consequence of it signing up new subscribers.
Ineos wants to conduct seismic surveys at Clumber Park in Nottinghamshire to see if there is potential for fracking. The firm said the charity had blocked any contact for almost a year and it was considering seeking a court order. The National Trust said it opposed any activities leading to the extraction of fossil fuels, so rejected requests. Moves to look for shale gas in the Sherwood Forest area have proved controversial due to environmental concerns over extraction - known as fracking - and expansion of fossil fuel use. Ineos said it already had permission from nearby landowners for the the non-invasive survey and its ability to extract gas would be "significantly limited" if it could not get on to Clumber Park. "If the National Trust refuses to change its position, Ineos will have no choice but to write to the Oil and Gas Authority, asking for permission to seek a court order enforcing its rights to carry out these surveys on National Trust land," it said in a statement. The company said government licences gave it a legal obligation to investigate shale gas deposits around the country and criticised the charity's position as "overtly political" as shale gas had lower carbon emissions than either oil and gas. A National Trust spokesman said: "The National Trust is opposed to fracking on its land and will reject any fracking requests or inquiries. "Consistent with this, we say no to surveying on our land for fracking purposes."	A petrochemical company is threatening legal action over the National Trust's refusal to allow testing for shale gas on its land.
The huts, made of chalk and straw daub and wheat-thatched roofing, have been based on archaeological remains found at Durrington Walls, near Stonehenge. Project leader Luke Winter said: "What we're trying to do is get a sense of what these buildings looked like above-ground." The hope is to re-build the huts at Stonehenge visitor centre next year. "What makes the buildings interesting is that they were dated to about the same time as the large sarsen stones were being erected at Stonehenge," Mr Winter said. "One of the theories is that these may have housed the people that were helping with construction of that monument." Inside, the project team has used a variety of different daubs, made of pig soil [dung] or chalk and straw and construction techniques that would have been used by  Neolithic people. "We've been trying a completely different way of thatching a roof. Nothing is tied onto the roof, as you would in a modern thatched building but the wheat straw that we've used is knotted and then tucked into a woven framework. "Often people think 4,500 years ago is a long time ago, which of course to us as modern people it is, but it's well into beginnings of agriculture. "We're looking at people that were farming, keeping cows and domesticating cereal crops, and of course houses were an important thing." The Neolithic huts will be kept for another two months and will open to the public during the two May bank holidays.	Three Neolithic-style huts have been built at Old Sarum to offer an insight into how Stonehenge's builders lived.
He made more than 40 feature films in a career spanning 60 years. Many of his films - including Kanal, Man of Marble, Man of Iron and Katyn - were inspired by Poland's turbulent wartime and communist history. In 2000, Wajda was awarded an honorary Oscar for his contribution to world cinema. Wajda had been recently taken to hospital. Unconfirmed reports say he died of lung failure. Wajda's last film Powidoki (Afterimage) tells the life story of the avant-garde painter Wladyslaw Strzeminski, who suffered under the post-war Stalinist government in Poland. The director said he wanted to "warn against state intervention in art". The film was recently chosen as Poland's official entry for the best foreign language film at the 2017 Oscars. Four of Wajda's earlier works had been nominated for that category. Man of Iron won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival in 1981. Wajda once said that "the good Lord gave the director two eyes - one to look into the camera, the other to be alert to everything that is going on around him." Wajda was born in 1926 in the north-eastern Polish town of Suwalki. His father was among the victims of the Katyn massacre of Polish army officers by the Soviet Union in 1940. Wajda tried to follow in his father's footsteps, but was rejected by a military academy, and joined the Polish resistance in World War Two. During World War Two, Wajda joined the Polish resistance. He later studied to be a painter, before entering the Lodz Film School. In 1955, he made his feature film debut with Generation, set during the German occupation of Warsaw in World War Two.  It was followed by Kanal, and Ashes and Diamonds, which form a trilogy about life in wartime Poland. Some of his films found disfavour with the communist rulers of Poland because of their trenchant portraits of the wartime Warsaw Uprising and the suppression of the Solidarity movement in the 1980s. It was only after the fall of communism in 1989 that he was able to make his film about Katyn. "I never thought I would live to see the moment when Poland would be a free country," Wajda said in a 2007 interview with the Associated Press. "I thought I would die in that system. It was so surprising and so extraordinary that I lived to see freedom." Following Poland's first free elections in 1990, he served for two years as a senator in the upper house of parliament.	Oscar-winning Polish film director Andrzej Wajda has died aged 90, the Polish Filmmakers' Association has confirmed.
Ukrainian officials said inventory work began on Saturday morning with the actual pullback to start in the afternoon. The rebels in the Luhansk region said they were withdrawing tanks. Both sides have committed to pulling out materiel carrying weapons with less than 100mm (4in) calibre. The rebels in the Donetsk region were quoted as saying that they would start pulling out their weapons on 18 October. The withdrawal process is yet to be verified by international monitors from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE). The pullout date was announced at a meeting of leaders from Ukraine, Russia, France and Germany on Friday. Moscow denies sending troops and heavy weapons to the pro-Russian separatists. However, the Kremlin admits that Russian "volunteers" are fighting alongside the rebels in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. In a separate development, OSCE monitors said in a statement on Friday they spotted the powerful TOS-1 Buratino multiple rocket launcher in Luhansk. A spokesman for the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission (SMM) to Ukraine told the BBC the discovery was particularly significant because of the damage the rockets could cause. The rebels have not commented on the OSCE report. Ukraine crisis: Russia tests new weapons Ukraine 'can't stop Russian armour' In Paris, Russian President Vladimir Putin met Ukraine's Petro Poroshenko, France's Francois Hollande and German Chancellor Angela Merkel for the first time since they agreed a peace deal for Ukraine in Minsk in February. The so-called Normandy Four meeting assessed all elements of the deal, including the staging of local elections in the rebel-held regions and the withdrawal of heavy weapons from the line of contact. After the meeting, Mr Hollande said the pullout would start on Saturday, with Mr Poroshenko later confirming this in a statement (in Ukrainian). Mr Poroshenko said this process would then continue in stages and should be completed within 41 days. He said the 100m calibre pullout would include not just artillery pieces "but also tanks and mortars". Regarding the elections in the rebel-held areas, the French leader said they must be held according to Ukrainian law, as envisaged in the Minsk peace deal. Mr Poroshenko said the four leaders had supported the idea of the elections based exclusively on Ukrainian legislation and in the presence of OSCE observers, who should be granted full access. However, the rebels said before the Paris talks that they still intended to proceed with staging local elections on their terms. Kiev says such elections - to be held on different dates from the rest of Ukraine and not according to Ukrainian law - would be "fake". A ceasefire in eastern Ukraine has been holding since September, although there have been reports of occasional shelling. The clashes in the Luhansk and Donetsk region began in April 2014, a month after Russia annexed Ukraine's southern Crimea peninsula.	Ukraine's government forces and pro-Russian rebels say they have begun withdrawing weapons from the line of contact in the east of the country.
Wales wing Hallam Amos scored two fine tries in the second half while Dorian Jones kicked five points for the hosts. But Hamish Watson's touchdown, plus eight points from Sam Hidalgo-Clyne and a penalty from Blair Kinghorn, proved enough for the visitors. Edinburgh move to within four points of rivals Glasgow in sixth, though the Warriors have a game in hand. The Dragons had 20-year-old Wales centre Tyler Morgan and fly-half Dorian Jones back from long-term injuries, while Taulupe Faletau returned from Wales duties. Edinburgh scrum-half Hidalgo-Clyne was making his 50th appearance while the visitors also paraded their Scotland front row. On a muddy surface, the first half produced only penalties, with two from Hidalgo-Clyne and one from Kinghorn on target for the visitors, while Jones kicked one for the Dragons. Flanker Watson wasted a golden chance for the Scots after 24 minutes as he went for the line rather than using the men free outside. The Dragons started the second half at a higher tempo and after barely a minute, Amos sprinted through a gap to score with Jones' conversion giving them the lead. But Edinburgh struck back in their next attack as Watson wrestled his way over from a line-out drive and Hidalgo-Clyne put over the angled kick. Amos then produced a superb finish from 30 metres out when given an overlap from man-of-the-match Faletau's pass. But that unconverted score after 53 minutes proved to be the last of the match. Edinburgh kept the Dragons pinned in their own half in the final quarter but Hidalgo-Clyne was off target with two more penalty attempts as they failed to make their pressure pay. It was the Welsh side's ninth losing bonus point of the season, including five in the last six matches. Dragons host Ospreys on Friday in their final game at Rodney Parade this season, before their European Challenge Cup quarter-final at Gloucester on 9 April, while Edinburgh host Zebre on Friday.

An invoice for £170 was sent to subscribers to the Scotland Supporters Club mailing list just after 09:00. The email - addressed "Dear Customer" - provided a link for payment, which was a disguised website address. The SFA said a third-party email database had been compromised and urged recipients to delete the email. Its statement said: "We would like to apologise to those who have received a spoof email this morning purporting to be from the Scottish FA." It recommended that anyone who may have opened it run a security check on their computer to ensure no malware had been installed. It said: "We would like to assure all supporters that no bank or credit card details have been shared. "We have moved to delete this account and the issue has been raised with our suppliers. "We will provide an update in early course." Fans on message boards suggested that clicking on the link within the scam email could infect computers with a virus and leave them out of pocket. The email contained links identical to those sent on official communications to supporters and were signed off as being from the "Accounts Department" of the Scotland Supporters Club. The group - which gives members access to away tickets for Scotland matches - currently has 29,231 members.	Thousands of football fans were sent a scam email asking them to pay a bill after a Scottish Football Association database was apparently hacked.
The builder said it would construct 139 homes at Duddingston Park South, Duddingston, and 165 at Newcraighall Village. Barratt Homes will also build a total of 102 affordable homes between the two developments. Newcraighall Village and Duddingston Park South are both set to launch later this year. Anne Ross, sales director at Barratt Homes for the East of Scotland, said: "2014 has been buoyant year for new homes sales and we are pleased to be launching these two new developments in the Edinburgh area, to allow us to keep up with demand. "With a wide selection of modern homes on offer and in sought-after locations, we hope these developments will be extremely popular."	Barratt Homes has confirmed it is pressing ahead with plans to build 400 new homes in the east of Scotland.
Michael Gunn, a retired chartered accountant, wants to spend some of it on a new roof for the church hall. But in defiance of experts, he also wants to use the money for a transatlantic cruise. The changes take effect on Bank Holiday Monday, so Mr Gunn will receive the payment on Tuesday morning. "I had no idea they'd whisk me into the limelight, and say I am the first," he told the BBC. "But I don't mind that." Initially he wants to donate cash to the fund for the church hall roof - in the village of Newton Poppleford - after it burnt down in a fire. But later in the year he is planning to take his wife across the Atlantic on board the Queen Mary Two. Mr Gunn was not prepared to say how much he would be taking out of his pension pot, but he has taken care to heed warnings about tax bills. "What I like about this is that you are totally in charge of how much tax you are exposed to - to stay within a lower tax band," he said. Last week the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said thousands of people withdrawing money might find themselves paying much more tax than they needed to. Other experts have pointed out that, in any case, people taking out cash will have to pay what is called "emergency tax". Unless individuals can show a P45 tax form, HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) will treat any payments as if they are a new monthly salary. In other words, they will charge tax on the basis that the new income is repeated every month for a year. So anyone cashing in a pension of Â£18,000 - assuming nothing is taken tax-free- would be charged an immediate tax bill of Â£6,592. Those in that position will have to reclaim the tax using forms P50 or P53. However HMRC has promised they will get the money back within a month. Meanwhile, hundreds of staff from Citizens Advice - and Citizens Advice Scotland - are preparing to offer free face-to-face interviews with anyone who needs help, from Tuesday. Those aged 55 or over can go to one of 500 offices in England and Wales, or 90 in Scotland. Those living in very remote areas of Scotland can arrange home visits. But customers will only receive "guidance", not advice. "What we don't do is provide any details of which companies people can go to for pensions - or which particular products," said Richard Chilton, one of those who will be conducting the interviews. "But we provide guidance on what the options are," he said. Anyone wanting to book an interview, or receive telephone guidance, should call the Pension Wise service, on 030 0330 1001.

Scrum-half Murray took a heavy blow to the head in a tackle but was allowed to return to the field after belatedly being sent for an assessment. However, Munster say Murray showed no signs of concussion. Recently, Northampton were found to have breached rules by allowing George North to play on after a head injury. Sale are currently being investigated for an incident involving TJ Ioane. European Cup organisers confirmed to BBC Sport that an Untoward Incident Review Group will convene early this week to decide whether Munster had broken concussion management protocols. Munster insist Murray was assessed at the time of the incident and did not appear to be concussed. The club said upon further review of the footage by Munster medics, he was removed for a head-injury assessment as a precaution. He passed that and returned to the field of play and subsequently passed a second head-injury assessment after the match. The 14-12 victory over Glasgow means Munster are now guaranteed to top Pool One, sealing a quarter-final place in Europe's elite tournament for the 16th time in 22 seasons.	Munster will be investigated over their management of Conor Murray's head injury in the European Champions Cup victory over Glasgow on Saturday.
Captcha checks typically ask people to complete a puzzle that a computer would struggle to complete correctly. They are designed to stop automated bots accessing and using websites. Google's new system tracks how a person interacts with a website to prove they are real, so the puzzles are no longer necessary for most people. Captcha checks are often deployed by concert ticket websites to stop people setting up automated bots to buy all the best tickets. They also appear when somebody is trying to log in to a website with the wrong password, to spot automated attempts. The puzzles present challenges that people find simple but computers can find more difficult, such as: The puzzles also benefit companies such as Google by helping train artificial intelligence algorithms. For example, if Google's AI can not recognise a house number in a photograph taken by a Streetview car, it may add the photo to its Captcha system to get human input. However, genuine users can find the interruption by puzzles a nuisance. Google's reCaptcha system has already simplified the process by asking users to tick a check box on the website they are using. The box monitors how each person has interacted with it, to separate natural human clicks from bots. For example, an automated script might take just a second to fill in a form on a website, and may not move the mouse at all during the process. Google's latest development removes the check box as well, and instead analyses how people have interacted with other elements on a website such as the "submit form" button. However, in some cases "suspicious" activity will still trigger a puzzle.	Website security checks that challenge people to prove they are human are likely to "disappear" in favour of a new system developed by Google.
Burberry rose 2.81% on speculation that the company could be takeover target for a US private equity firm. Mining shares were hit by a number of broker downgrades following recent falls in commodity prices. At close of trade in London the FTSE 100  index of leading blue chip stocks was ahead by 77.95 points, or 1.12%, at 7015.36. Anglo American shares fell 0.24% after Credit Suisse cut its rating on the company to "neutral" from "outperform". Downgrades also hit BHP Billiton, which fell 1.09%. Credit Suisse cut its rating for BHP to "underperform" from "neutral", while Investec downgraded to "sell" from "hold". On the currency markets, the pound fell 0.83% against the dollar to $1.4743 but was up 0.17% against the euro to ???1.3813. Sterling was weakened by the latest UK trade figures, which showed the trade deficit widening by more than expected in February. The Bank of England kept UK interest rates on hold at 0.5% - as expected - following its latest meeting.	(Close): Fashion house Burberry led the market higher following speculation that it could be a bid target.
President Thein Sein said the deal had opened up the "road to future peace" in Myanmar, also known as Burma. But the most active of rebel groups have not signed the agreement, which comes after two years of negotiations. Myanmar has been engaged in armed conflict with various ethnic and other groups seeking greater autonomy since independence from the British in 1948. The violence has left tens of thousands dead over the years, displaced hundreds of thousands more and has been used by the military to justify its long hold on political power. Resolving the conflicts is seen as central to Myanmar's attempts to reform after decades of military rule. The government hopes Thursday's deal - which comes weeks ahead of general elections - will be the first step on a path to a lasting political settlement. Speaking at the lavish signing ceremony in the capital, Nay Pyi Taw, Thein Sein said it was a "historic day for Myanmar". "We have been able to launch a new road to a peaceful future of our country." The chairman of one of the armed groups, the Karen National Union (KNU), called it "a new page in history and a product of brave and energetic negotiations". The agreement is neither truly nationwide nor strictly speaking a ceasefire. In order to take part in this collective agreement the armed groups had to have previously signed a bilateral ceasefire with the government. So it is not actually halting any conflicts. This at times tortuous process has been about trying to get everyone to the start line before the next phase, political dialogue, gets under way. With only about half the groups having made it to the start line, the way forward from here will be ever more complex. Read more: Ceasefire marks milestone for Myanmar But seven of the armed groups which have been involved in the talks did not sign the final deal. Among them is the largest, the United Wa State Army (UWSA), which has some 25,000 members operating on the border with China, and has largely remained on the sidelines of the talks. Also not signing was the Kachin Independence Organisation (KIO), whose Independence Army (KIA) controls large areas of north-eastern Kachin state and has regularly clashed with the Burmese army since a ceasefire collapsed in 2011. Thein Sein said the government would "continue with our efforts to bring the remaining organisations into the process". "The door is open for them," he said. Political discussions are now due to begin within months on the structure of a new, and probably more federal, system of government, says our correspondent. But there are still concerns that peace with the groups signing Thursday's agreement could be short lived, if the Burmese army ignores the ceasefire, as it has with others. Earlier this week, all of the groups signing were removed from the government's list of "unlawful associations", a step towards bringing them into mainstream politics. Opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who has previously urged rebel groups to focus more on a lasting deal than a quick one, was not at the signing ceremony. Representatives from the United Nations, the European Union, India and China and others witnessed the signing.	Myanmar has signed a ceasefire deal with eight armed rebel groups, in the hope of ending decades of conflict.
They say the arrests happened when protesters refused to leave land owned by the pipeline company. A spokesman said the latest arrests brought the number detained since August to almost 700. They came after the US Army was ordered to allow the construction of the final section of the Dakota Access Pipeline. Native Americans and their supporters have protested against the project for months, and have vowed to fight on. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe say the final section - under Lake Oahe, a reservoir on the Missouri River - would contaminate drinking water on their land and damage sacred burial sites. Morton County Sheriff's Office spokesman Rob Keller said the latest arrests were made after demonstrators moved from their existing camp on flood-prone ground to land owned by the pipeline company, Energy Transfer Partners. He said no injuries had been reported during the operation. Protest leaders could not be reached for comment. The $3.7bn (Â£2.8bn) pipeline is designed to transport about 470,000 barrels of crude oil a day across four states, from North Dakota to a terminal in Illinois, where it can be shipped to refineries. The US Army Corps of Engineers, which has approval authority, decided last year to explore other routes for the pipeline amid huge protests by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. But earlier this week, acting Secretary of the Army Robert Speer ordered the corps to allow the work to go ahead. President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order signalling his support for the pipeline.	Police in the US state of North Dakota say they have arrested 76 people protesting against a controversial oil pipeline.
Sandra Bland was arrested during a heated traffic stop captured on film. She was found dead three days later. The 28-year-old's death and the video footage of her arrest sparked outrage. The arresting officer, Brian Encinia, has been charged with allegedly lying about it, a prosecutor announced after a day of grand jury discussions. Hours later, he was fired from his job. The grand jury had picked out the officer's affidavit as behind their decision, said special prosecutor Shawn McDonald. In that affidavit, Mr Encinia had claimed that Ms Bland was "combative and uncooperative" after he pulled her over. The argument began after she was asked to put out her cigarette and he demanded she get out of her car. Video footage showed the police officer drawing his stun gun and threatening Ms Bland with the words: "I will light you up!" After the argument moved off-camera, she was heard screaming that he was about to break her wrists and she complained that her head knocked against the ground. Mr McDonald said grand jurors found Mr Encinia's statement that he had "removed her from her vehicle to further conduct a safer traffic investigation" to be false. Soon after the indictment, the Texas Department of Public Safety said "termination proceedings" would start immediately. Ms Bland's death three days after her arrest was ruled a suicide and the sheriff's officials and jailers were cleared of any crime. But it sparked national headlines for days amid a debate about the police use of force against African Americans. The perjury charge carries a maximum sentence of one year in jail and a $4,000 fine.	A Texas police officer has been charged with perjury over his confrontation with a woman who died in jail shortly after being arrested.
Judge Aaron Persky has been heavily criticised for giving student Brock Turner six months for assaulting an unconscious woman last year. Two other petitions have reached 115,000 and 175,000 signatures each. The petitions have no legal force but organisers hope they will increase pressure on politicians to act. Mr Persky, a Superior Court judge in Santa Clara County, California, has reportedly received death threats in the wake of the case. The jail sentence he handed down to Turner has been widely criticised as too lenient. Prosecutors had called for six years. Turner was seen by two other students sexually assaulting his victim, now 23, behind an outdoor rubbish bin. He tried to flee the scene but was caught and later admitted to the assault in court. Rights activists and members of the general public have accused Mr Persky of being influenced by Turner's upbringing in a wealthy, white family, and his achievements as a college swimmer. The petition, posted on Change.org, says that Mr Persky had "failed to send the message that sexual assault is against the law regardless of social class, race, gender or other factors". The judge said in his remarks that he was concerned about the "severe impact" a longer sentence would have on Turner's life. Turner's father was also criticised after issuing a statement to the court saying his son was paying a steep price for only "20 minutes of action". Turner, who was a promising swimmer expected to compete for the US at Olympic level, has been banned for life by USA Swimming, the governing body for professional swimming in the US. The victim, who has not been named by the press, read an impact statement in court which was later read by millions. US Vice-President Joe Biden, who is involved in a campaign against campus assaults, wrote her an open letter praising her for her courage and saying he was "filled with furious anger" at the course of events. The cast of the TV show Girls have also made a video backing the woman and other victims of sexual assault.	More than a million people have signed a petition calling for the judge in the controversial Stanford University sexual assault case to be sacked.
Dressed in a suit, he handed out currencies in exchange for sterling to customers at the Asda in Trafford Park, police said. He then emptied the safe into a bag before walking out of the store at 15:45 BST on 29 July. Police said they were still searching for the man, described as in his mid 20s or 30s, Asian and of slim build. A 22-year-old woman has been arrested and bailed on suspicion of conspiracy to defraud.	A man has walked away with £40,000 from a superstore in Manchester after posing as a manager at the Bureau de Change.
The operation foiled a plan to smuggle drugs and weapons from South America to the port of Gioia Tauro in Calabria, officials said. The raids targeted two mafia crime families, the Gambino of New York and the Ndrangheta from Calabria. FBI agents travelled to Italy to take part in the raids. Police said the two-year investigation prevented the delivery to Italy of hundreds of kilograms of cocaine hidden in coconuts and pineapples, as well as heroin and marijuana. Gioia Tauro, the intended destination of the drugs, is one of Europe's largest shipping ports. Eight of the arrests were made in New York, and are linked with the Gambino crime family which is believed to have negotiated the deal. The other 18 people were arrested in Italy are believed to have been involved with the Ndrangheta clan.	Police in the US and Italy say they have arrested 26 people in a joint raid against a new mafia-operated drug trafficking route.
When the nozzle releasing a stream of molten glass is raised above a certain level, that thread begins to wobble. It traces out waves or loops - which the team found could be controlled by adjusting the speed of the nozzle. Those shapes then become the building blocks for intricate, 3D objects. Engineers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology pioneered a method for glass 3D printing in 2015. They then started to work with mathematician Pierre-Thomas Brun, who has studied the fluid dynamics of liquid "ropes". The results are documented in a video, which the team presented in the American Physical Society's "Gallery of Fluid Motion" in November. It all started with a collaboration between two labs at MIT, Dr Brun told the BBC - one specialising in glass and the other in "mediated matter". Runny honey "Normally when you 3D print, the nozzle is very close to the piece that you're printing - that's the conventional method. But what they started working with was having a large offset. "And in that case, instead of having a thread that falls down and moves straight, you can create coil-like patterns like honey on toast." That coiling process, as it happens, is exactly what Dr Brun studied during his PhD. "I came up with a reduced model that explained the dynamics of these things," he said. "So I have a way to rationalise the patterns they observed, and we started working together in order to create some structures that take those patterns as building blocks." Suddenly, instead of being a potential flaw in the system, the wobbling of the liquid glass became a tunable design feature. And what is more, some of the tiny loops are smaller than anything that could be created by moving the nozzle itself around. The physics of the dribbling glass itself was now a precision instrument. What most impressed Dr Brun was how simple it was to control that instrument. For a given nozzle height, he explained, everything boils down to how fast the glass is being poured, relative to how fast the nozzle is moving forward. "These coils may seem complex, but you can rationalise them in a very simple way. And to do that you need one number: how fast is the glass falling onto the surface?" If the dribbling of the glass starts to outstrip the forward progress of the nozzle, the thread will trace out a meandering, wavy line instead of a straight one. Then if the forward motion gets even slower, the glass will start to trace small, alternating loops. Even slower, and the loops become one big coil. It was a surprise, Dr Brun said, that this simple ratio produced such a variety of shapes. "This is a very complex system, but you can forget about all the other properties. That's a big statement, which has no reason to be true - but it is, in this case." Following the lead of other researchers, studying the dynamics of viscous liquid threads nearly 10 years ago, Dr Brun and his colleagues called their system a "sewing machine". "It does exactly what a sewing machine does," he observed. "You go from a thread, to patterns which are tied to each other like stitching patterns - but this time they're made out of glass." Many of his collaborators at MIT are interested in potential applications for architecture, and the design may also prove useful in sculpture and in 3D printing - or "additive manufacturing" - more widely. "There are many possibilities, but for now this is just a proof of concept," Dr Brun said. Follow Jonathan on Twitter	US researchers have developed what they call a "molten glass sewing machine" by combining 3D printing of glass with a mathematical model of how a liquid thread forms different types of loop.
The 23-year-old made 116 as Tim Groenewald and Lewis Gregory rattled through the rest of the hosts line-up. Jennings, who hit 15 fours, finally fell top-edging Josh Davey to gully before Durham were bowled out for 256. Tom Abell and Davey fell lbw to Rushworth, then Onions bowled Marcus Trescothick as Somerset closed on 30-3. Durham batsmen Mark Stoneman and Scott Borthwick both fell cheaply as Somerset started brightly before Jack Burnham (33) helped repair the innings in a 79-run third-wicket partnership with Jennings. Burnham eventually fell when he was bowled by Davey. Gregory then claimed two wicket in two balls, including uprooting Paul Collingwood's middle stump first ball, as Somerset looked to gain some momentum. Rushworth became Gregory's fourth victim of the day, departing to an exceptional slip catch from Jim Allenby it left the visitors with 12 overs to face. And last year's Division One leading wicket-taker struck in his fourth when Abell was trapped playing across the line before nightwatchman Davey was caught out in the next over when the ball nipped back. Onions' inswinging yorker then dismissed the Somerset captain as the away side limped to the close, trailing by 226 runs.	Keaton Jennings' century and three quick wickets from opening pair Chris Rushworth and Graham Onions gave Durham the edge against Somerset on day one.
Footage showed the workers rescued through a hole cut in one of the glass windows of One World Trade Center. The Fire Department of New York earlier told the BBC the two people were uninjured and tethered. The call came in at 12:42 EST (17:42 GMT) and firefighters were on the scene in less than four minutes, it said. The window cleaners were pulled inside at around 14:15 EST. The rescued men were identified as Juan Lopez, who has been a window cleaner for five years, and Juan Lizama, who has been on the job for 14 years, Gerard McEneaney, a labour union official, told Reuters. The 1,776ft (541m) tower opened for business last week as the first of 3,000 employees of publishing giant Conde Nast moved into their new offices there. A police official said the partially collapsed cradle was hanging at "a 75-degree angle". The cable on the cradle apparently broke as it retracted towards the roof of the building. People on the ground were moved back in case glass fell from One World Trade Center, the country's tallest skyscraper. Gary Hansen, an architect who worked on the building, happened to be across the street during the incident. Mr Hansen told Reuters the building was designed with three cranes on top, two to suspend platforms and one for emergencies. "These are the kind of emergencies architects plan for," he said.	New York firefighters have rescued two window cleaners who were trapped on a collapsed cradle 69 storeys above the ground at the World Trade Center site.
Entries for all candidates in England, Northern Ireland and Wales are down 0.7% on last year to 5,240,796, according to official figures. By contrast, in England the overall entry for GCSEs in England increased slightly from 4,916,000 in 2015 to 4,929,000 this year. Early entries (for students in Year 10 or below) fell for the second year running in England to 300,000 - a 13% drop on 2015. This follows a 32% fall from 504,000 in 2014 to 344,000 in 2015 and reflects government moves to discourage schools from entering pupils early. But more older students were entered this year, reflecting the raising of the participation age in education to 17 in 2013 and then to 18 last year. The government is also encouraging older pupils to resit English and maths if they do not achieve good grades (A* to C) in Year 11 This year there were 355,000 GCSE entries for post-Year 11 students, up 26% on last year's figure of 282,000. By subject, Ofqual noted 2016 increases for Year 11 students in English literature, biology, chemistry, physics, geography, history, science, additional science Spanish and computing. But entries fell in English and English language, German and French. In England this year's GCSEs will be the last to be marked under the existing system, graded A* to G. Last September new "more demanding" courses were introduced in English and maths for the current Year 10 - but this change will not have any affect on this year's results as the new courses are linear and will be examined next summer at the end of two years. In England students who started GCSE courses last September in maths, English and English literature will be graded 1-9 in these subjects when they get their results in summer 2017. The new grades will come in for most other GCSEs the following year. These include biology, chemistry, physics, computer science, languages, religious education, geography, music and history, which will be taught from September 2016, with exams in 2018. A third wave of 1-9 graded GCSEs will be taught from September 2017 with exams in 2019. These include psychology, ancient history, business, information and communications technology (ICT) and media studies. Ofqual has also said that it expects broadly the same proportion of students who currently received a grade C and above under the current system to achieve a grade 4 and above under the new system. The new courses will include far less coursework, with grades in almost all subjects depending on exams. These courses are designed to be more rigorous with exams taken after two years of study rather than in modules with exams along the way. Foundation and higher-tier papers for students in different ability ranges will be phased out. A GCSE reform programme is also under way in Wales with new courses from the WJEC board taught in Welsh schools from last September in six key subjects. These are English language, Welsh language, English literature, Welsh literature, mathematics and numeracy and mathematics. The November 2017 and summer 2017 exams will reflect these new qualifications and the results will no longer be comparable with their equivalents in England, says the Welsh government. Northern Ireland is also developing new GCSE specifications for first teaching from September 2017 and will retain A*-G grades rather than adopt England's new numeric grading system. Some schools offer courses from English exam boards alongside those from the Northern Ireland board, CCEA. You may get your results by text, email or in the post, but it's still a good idea to go to your school or college on results day. By doing this, you can get help and advice from your teachers. If you live in England, yes. This summer's GCSE cohort in England (born between 1 September 1999 and 31 August 2000) is the second to have to stay in education or employment with training until 18. In Scotland, if you turn 16 between 1 March and 30 September, you can leave school after 31 May of that year. If you turn 16 between 1 October and the end of February, you can leave at the start of the Christmas holidays in that school year. In Wales, you can leave school on the last Friday in June, as long as you will be 16 by the end of that school year's summer holidays. In Northern Ireland, if you turn 16 during the school year (between 1 September and 1 July), you can leave school after 30 June. If you turn 16 between 2 July and 31 August, you cannot leave school until 30 June the following year. Try not to panic. If you don't get the grades asked for by the sixth-form or college of your choice, approach the staff there and see if they are prepared to be flexible. It's possible they will still give you a place or they might be prepared to take you on for different courses. Alternatively, approach other schools or colleges - you might find they will accept you. Resits will be complicated by the course changes, with the current set of GCSEs in English and maths being phased out. Ofqual has required the boards to offer resits in the current English, English and maths exams in November and next summer and in science subjects no later than summer 2018. For other current GCSE courses, boards will also be allowed to offer a single resit opportunity in the year following the last scheduled sitting. Students will have to resit all the exams for the qualification and there is an expectation that candidates will be at least 16. If you feel strongly that your grades are wrong and do not reflect your ability, you can ask for a re-mark of your papers. Requests for re-marking can only be done through your school or college. Make sure someone there is dealing with the matter. There is a fee for this service, which is reimbursed only if there is a grade change. The Joint Council for Qualifications has guidelines on the post-results service available to schools. You can call the national exam results helpline on 0808 100 8000 or the National Careers Service on 0800 100 900.	Pupils in England, Wales and Northern Ireland are receiving their GCSE results - just over two weeks after teenagers in Scotland received the results of their equivalent National 4s and 5s.
The 33-year-old goalkeeper was busy in a 3-3 draw, his first taste of the Champions League group stage. Having been the number one choice for the past two seasons, Gordon was playing after Dorus de Vries picked up an injury at the weekend. "I was happy with how I played - that's all I can do," he said. "Everybody wants to be a part of nights like that. There is no bigger incentive to play well and keep your place." Former Hearts and Sunderland keeper Gordon started the first nine matches of the season but lost his place to summer recruit De Vries in mid-August. Gordon was a half-time replacement in Saturday's win over Kilmarnock, with the 35-year-old Dutchman suffering a chest injury. De Vries was fit enough to be among the substitutes in a thriller with Manchester City in which Gordon made two good stops to deny Ilkay Gundogan, one late in the game from a deflected strike. "This is the highest level of club football and to finally manage that at the age of 33 is a special moment for me," said Gordon. "We'd have liked to get the three points but it was an incredible effort against a top quality side." Asked how the match ranked in his long career, he replied: "It's right up there. The atmosphere was just incredible. "The noise was unbelievable. There was a couple of times when I was absolutely screaming at Kolo [Toure] to leave the ball and he just couldn't hear me. I couldn't have shouted any louder." Gordon, capped 44 times for Scotland, insists his self-belief has not wavered since dropping to the bench and is hoping manager Brendan Rodgers will find it difficult to reinstate De Vries. "I've always been confident in what I'm able to do," he added. "It was other people saying my confidence was gone. "If I've not been selected, that's the manager's decision and I fully respect that. "The other side of that is that I want to play every game. "I think I've done pretty well in stages this season and if I can get a run in the team then hopefully I can go from strength to strength."	Craig Gordon hopes an impressive display against Manchester City can help him retain a regular starting position at Celtic.
All 108 MLAs met to sign the roll of membership, with 29 newly-elected members doing so for the first time. The Ulster Unionists announced they will form an opposition. UUP leader Mike Nesbitt said "let battle commence". Mr Nesbitt, said the first and deputy first minister would not have the support of his party at the executive table, as the "Ulster Unionist MLA group have unanimously decided to form the first official opposition of this Northern Ireland Assembly". He said: "This is a big and bold move to bring a better and a more normal democracy to the people of Northern Ireland - let battle commence!". Mr McGuinness said Mr Nesbitt's move was "deeply disappointing" and a "huge mistake". "It will be seen as a lack of leadership," he added. SDLP (Social Democratic and Labour Party) leader Colum Eastwood said they have some work to do before making any decisions. Alliance party leader David Ford congratulated Mr Nesbitt on the "sound bite of the day". "Some of us recognise that government is a bit more substantial than the sound bite of the day" he said. The DUP's Robin Newton has been elected as the new speaker, replacing Mitchel McLaughlin, who announced his retirement before the election. Mr Newton said he wants to "uphold the standards that his predecessors have set". "The people of Northern Ireland are looking to us," he added. "I want to prove to them that we are moving forward." Sinn Féin's Caitríona Ruane, the SDLP's Patsy McGlone and the UUP's Danny Kennedy have been elected as deputy speakers. Ms Ruane has been elected as the principal deputy speaker. People Before Profit Alliance MLAs Eamonn McCann and Gerry Carroll were among the newly-elected members signing the roll. Mr Carroll revealed via social media that when they were asked to designate as "unionist, nationalist or other", he and Mr McCann wrote "socialist". "We will be put in the 'other' camp, but we are clear where we stand," he said. "This isn't the Alliance Party. This is the new socialist alternative." MLAs also undertook to support the rule of law, challenge paramilitary activity and accept no authority but a democratic mandate. Live coverage of proceedings at the new NI assembly The full Northern Ireland Executive will be formed when a programme for government has been agreed. The parties, who were given an outline of a framework for government programme on Tuesday, have until Thursday to make a response. Negotiations on the framework could go on for two weeks. In last week's election, the Democratic Unionist Party maintained the 38 seats it held in the last assembly, while Sinn Féin lost one and now holds 28. The Ulster Unionists have 16 seats, while the Social Democratic and Labour Party lost two and now have 12. The Alliance Party secured eight seats during the election, meaning it does not have enough seats to automatically qualify for a ministerial department.	The DUP's Arlene Foster has been reappointed as Northern Ireland first minister and Sinn Féin's Martin McGuinness as deputy first minister, with the UUP announcing they will form an opposition at the Stormont assembly.
Winners of the cup competition earn a place in the Europa League. Four-time cup winners Forest have failed to progress past the third round for the past 11 seasons and start their campaign at Doncaster on Tuesday. "It's very important because it is the only way to go into the Europa League," Montanier told BBC Radio Nottingham. "I know it's difficult because there are a lot of teams from the Premier League and Championship. It will be a very important game." Forest, two-time European Cup winners under Brian Clough in 1979 and 1980, who also guided the club to its four League Cup titles, last featured in European competition in the 1995-96 season, reaching the Uefa Cup quarter-finals. The Reds, who last won the League Cup in 1990 and featured in the final in 1992, were knocked out of the competition by League One side Walsall 12 months ago. Their trip to face League Two side Doncaster comes three days after Montanier oversaw Forest's Championship season opening victory against Burton Albion, in what was his first competitive match in English football. Former Rennes boss Montanier also confirmed that the injury to goalkeeper Dorus de Vries, suffered in the 4-3 victory over Burton on Saturday, is not as bad as first feared. "It will be a few weeks, but not serious," Montanier said.	Nottingham Forest manager Philippe Montanier says he wants to guide the Championship side into Europe next season as EFL Cup holders.
Investigations are continuing into why the vehicle ploughed into Catherine Bonner's flat in Main Road, Fairlie, at about 13:45 on Thursday. The A78 through the village is expected to remain closed until early next week. A 55-year-old man who also lived in the flats continues to be treated for minor injuries at Inverclyde Royal Hospital. He and the driver were rescued by the emergency services from the rubble. The 54-year-old driver has been released after treatment. The lorry has been removed from the building and has been taken away to undergo further tests that will help establish the cause of the crash. North Ayrshire Council said it was working with contractors and engineers to ensure that the properties affected "are made safe". "Engineers and contractors have started work to secure the affected buildings and it is expected that a partial demolition may be required to ensure the site is made safe," the council said in a statement. "The council has agreed that contractors can work into and through the night, if necessary. "It is hoped that this will allow the A78 to re-open early next week." The council said it had arranged for letters to be delivered to all 600 households in Fairlie informing them of the situation and making them aware that some noise disturbance is likely through the night while work is ongoing. The statement added: "The council has apologised in advance for any disturbance which may be caused." Fairlie Community Council has been campaigning for road improvements in the area. It has argued that the route is not suitable for traffic that includes lorries heading to Hunterston power station. Councillor John Ferguson, North Ayrshire Council's cabinet member for infrastructure, said: "While responsibility for management of the A78 trunk road lies with Transport Scotland, the council has lobbied - and will continue to lobby - for improvements to the road. "A draft version of the North Ayrshire Local Plan, published in 2003, called on the (then) Scottish Executive to 'fully assess the need for further improvements on the trunk road network and bring forward schemes at the earliest possible date for the A78 coastal route'. "While the specific reference to a Fairlie by-pass was removed at the request of the Scottish Executive's reporter, the council's aspiration for improvement schemes along the A78 coastal route remains."	Work will continue through the night to make safe the site of a house struck by a lorry in an accident that led to the death of a 55-year-old woman.
They face a monumental task. The death toll is uncertain - it teeters around the 6,000 mark. For emergency staff though it is the living, trapped in remote areas, whom they are desperate to reach. Many have broken bones. Some face the threat of crush syndrome - where the kidneys start to fail. But the Nepalese health system was stretched even before the quake. The charity Save the Children says it is now at breaking point. Most people live in remote areas that can be difficult to access even when natural disasters do not stand in the way. Some of the most critical needs now are obvious - surgeons are arriving to fix broken bones, injured spines and head trauma. And Save the Children medical teams are hearing reports that thousands need operations. Another charity in the area, Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) has deployed an inflatable hospital so treatment can be given in otherwise inaccessible places. But some are concerned that people who have been trapped under rubble remain at risk of crush syndrome. This is when the body releases toxins in response to massive and sustained injuries- and these can overwhelm the kidneys as they try to flush them out. Dialysis - artificial kidney machines - can help. But according to MSF, Kathmandu's main hospital only has eight. Such life-saving equipment only counts if people can be transferred to safety. At the moment though, there is an urgency for more basic needs -  shelter, safe water, sanitation and food. At least 2.8 million people have been displaced - either because their houses have been destroyed or because they are too afraid of aftershocks to remain at home. And without safe ways to dispose of waste, drinking water is in danger of being contaminated by fatal bugs. In some places, public toilets are overflowing. The World Health Organization (WHO) is on alert for any outbreaks of diarrhoeal diseases including infections such as cholera. According to their experts, there have been some sporadic cases of diarrhoeal illness reported in makeshift camps. Though things aren't near outbreak proportions, the coming rainy season could make things worse. Dr Prince Mathew, from MSF, said: "With the monsoon season approaching, we're worried that the window of opportunity to reach people in these areas is rapidly closing." Katrin Kisswani, medical co-ordinator for MSF arrived in Kathmandu two days after the quake hit. She told the BBC: "The most difficult thing is to reach the people most at need. "We have managed to start mobile clinics using helicopters to get to remote villages in the mountains. But many roads are still blocked by landslides." Some survivors have managed to reach the capital. Ms Kisswani added: "They are very, very shocked and traumatised. "Many have lost their livelihoods, their relatives and sometimes almost entire villages are gone." Psychological help is also required urgently, she said. While many people will see images of the destruction and naturally want to help, the World Health Organization cautions they should think carefully and ensure they are not a burden on local efforts. Dr Ian Norton said: "There are small teams that have been launched after watching the news and that are trying to respond with the best of intentions, but unfortunately they do not have the sustainability to be able to deploy into the remote areas where we need them the most."	A week after the earthquake hit, scores of rescue workers are still flying in to Nepal.
New rules come in on 1 January, which will reduce compensation to £75,000 per person, per institution. Previously the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) protected savings of up to £85,000 per account. Joint accounts will see protection cut from £170,000 to £150,000. The maximum compensation across the European Union is set at €100,000, and the British level was reduced as a result of the pound gaining strength against the euro. The precise rate was set on 3 July 2015. At the time, one senior Tory MP described the change as "defective". Although 95% of savers will still be protected, as many as 2.5 million people may not be, according to the FSCS. It is advising savers who have more than £75,000 in one account, or in one institution, to move their money if necessary. The situation is further complicated by the fact that some registered banks and building societies operate under more than one brand. So it you had £75,000 savings with HSBC, for example, any additional savings in First Direct would not be protected, as both banks have a joint licence. Savers using Bank of Scotland and Halifax are in the same position. But Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) and NatWest - although they are sister banks - are both registered separately. So savers could safely have up to £75,000 in accounts with both banks. "While this should be quite simple to navigate, it's made complicated by the fact that FSCS cover is shared between banks that operate under the same licence," said Hannah Maundrell, editor in chief of money.co.uk. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) publishes a full list of registered banks, and which brands come under the same umbrella. Under the new rules, savers who have up to £1m in their accounts temporarily - as a result of selling a house, or being made redundant, for example - are also protected. To receive compensation, they cannot have had that cash in their accounts for more than six months. A further warning comes in relation to some foreign banks which trade in the UK, but are registered within the eurozone, such as Germany's Fidor Bank, or Sweden's Handelsbanken. Handelsbanken confirmed that the level of compensation would depend on the exchange rate at the time. So depending on how much €100,000 is worth in pounds, savers may get more or less than £75,000 protection. At the time of writing, that amount is worth less than £74,000. "With an increasing number of European banks now offering competitive rates, customers need to be aware that not all savings accounts offered in the UK are covered by the UK compensation scheme," said Rachel Thrussell, savings insight manager at Moneyfacts.co.uk.	Millions of savers are being reminded that they may need to move some of their cash, to guarantee it will be fully protected in the event of their bank going bust.
Lee Waters said Neil McEvoy had suggested a "great party political conspiracy theory" was behind various matters the Public Accounts Committee had investigated. Mr Waters warned against the committee becoming a "circus". Mr McEvoy said he was "not surprised" Mr Waters "wants to brush the failures of his government under the carpet." Speaking in a Senedd debate about the committee's work, Mr McEvoy suggested former economy minister Edwina Hart or the first minister should be called to give evidence on several issues the committee had looked at. They included the Welsh Government's financial support for failed companies, its sale at a loss of two shops in Pontypridd and the RIFW land deals. "We need to get serious about ending financial waste in Wales, and I think the public accounts committee is the perfect place to do that," said Mr McEvoy . "I'd ask the chair if he would accept my call to put to the committee the suggestion of a forensic investigation into all these matters, because Labour incompetence is endangering devolution, and we have to shed light on these matters and bring transparency." Mr Waters responded: "It's imperative it [the public accounts committee] doesn't become a circus. "I have no problem following any evidence and in holding governments to account with rigour but that requires all members to take the committee seriously, to engage in its work, read the voluminous papers in advance, to engage with the evidence. "Not to spend the whole committee meeting tapping away at their iPhones then lobbing in some partisan-fuelled conspiracy theory, because that I think brings the committee into disrepute." Mr Waters said that "when there is evidence we must follow it" and "we should be ruthless in pursuing it". Following the debate, Mr McEvoy told BBC Wales: "I'm not surprised that Lee wants to brush the failures of his government under the carpet because he's a Labour AM. "It's becoming a consistent theme now that when I challenge Labour on the issues their AMs resort to smears and personal attacks. "I've highlighted Â£53m that the taxpayer has lost thanks to Labour incompetence - this isn't some conspiracy theory."	A Labour assembly member has accused a Plaid Cymru committee colleague of being a conspiracy theorist.
Traditionally it's always been much less good at keeping secrets. Journalists have a natural inclination toward gossip. So, it was highly unusual that BBC bosses had managed to keep the launch of a whole new BBC Scotland channel entirely secret until it was announced to staff on Wednesday morning. Staff, viewers and politicians were expecting to be told that plans for a "Scottish Six" had been shelved. No one knew that there would be an hour-long news programme with Scottish, UK and world news at 9pm instead. Already there has been a widespread welcome for the idea of a new channel, new programmes and most importantly new money to make those programmes. The announcement of new nightly news programme at 9pm does mean that the idea of a "Scottish Six" is now dead. So people who had been campaigning for that will be frustrated. Already the First Minster Nicola Sturgeon has said there is lots to welcome in this announcement but that it doesn't deliver everything she wanted. Saying it's disappointing that there is no Scottish Six - but "progress and hopefully sign of new thinking". Another SNP politician told me that the decision not to put a Scottish news hour on BBC One looks "entirely political". Saying that viewers accustomed to getting their news at tea time may not immediately develop the habit of watching a digital channel at 9pm. But for those who wanted a news programme reflecting the world from a Scottish perspective, produced and presented from Scotland - the BBC is now delivering what they asked for. The Scottish Six is dead. Long live the Scottish Nine.	The BBC is very experienced at broadcasting news to as many people as possible.
Michael Patterson was handed the order after being convicted of break-ins in the Levenshulme and Longsight areas of the city. His "consistent method" was to carry out burglaries after entering rear alleyways, magistrates heard. The 49-year-old, of Field Bank Grove, Gorton admitted three counts of burglary and possession of a Class B drug and was jailed for 16 months. The ban, known as a criminal behaviour order, will run indefinitely after his release. It will ban Patterson from entering rear alleyways with the exception of the one behind his own home. The order also prohibits him from entering an area of Stockport Road, from Stanley Grove in Longsight up to Albert Road in Levenshulme, and the surrounding streets. Premises targeted in the break-ins included a takeaway, a solicitors' office and a mobile phone shop. Nigel Murphy, Manchester City Council's executive member for neighbourhood services, said: "Michael Patterson has used the same technique repeatedly to commit a number of offences and this order will prevent him continuing the pattern."	A prolific burglar has been banned from all of Manchester's back alleyways.

The search was launched after the coastguard received reports from an individual claiming to be in difficulty off the coast of County Down. Two RNLI boats and a coastguard helicopter from Scotland were launched to assist in the search. The kayaker was reported to be near Mew Island, one of the Copeland Islands near Donaghadee. A coastguard spokesman said it received several calls from a person claiming to be in difficulty. However, the alarm was declared to be a hoax following a thorough search.	The coastguard has called off a search for a kayaker after it declared the alarm an "elaborate hoax".
In a report, the agency says the past decade in Europe has been the warmest on record. It adds that the cost of damage caused by extreme weather events is rising, and the continent is set to become more vulnerable in the future. The findings have been published ahead of next week's UN climate conference. They join a UN Environment Programme report also released on Wednesday showing dangerous growth in the "emissions gap" - the difference between current carbon emission levels and those needed to avert climate change. "Every indicator we have in terms of giving us an early warning of climate change and increasing vulnerability is giving us a very strong signal," observed EEA executive director Jacqueline McGlade. "It is across the board, it is not just global temperatures," she told BBC News. "It is in human health aspects, in forests, sea levels, agriculture, biodiversity - the signals are coming in from right across the environment." 2C or not 2C The report - Climate Change, Impacts and Vulnerabilities in Europe 2012 - involving more than 50 authors from a range of organisations, listed a number of "key messages", including: As it currently stands, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change has set a target of limiting the rise in global mean temperature to 2C (3.6F) above pre-industrial levels. But the report's authors warn that even if this target to mitigate warming is met, "substantial impacts on society, human health and ecosystems are projected to occur". To limit the impacts, experts say effective adaptation strategies need to be developed in order to minimise the risk to nations' infrastructure, homes and businesses. The European Commission is expected to publish its European Adaptation Strategy in 2013, outlining measures it think will help the 27-nation bloc deal with future climate shifts. Examples of adaptation measures include using water resources more efficiently, adapting building codes to be able to withstand extreme weather events and building flood defences. Prof McGlade said such measures would be essential in order to climate-proof the EU. "I think what the European Commission and other parts of the world are finding is that whilst it is important to understand what is happening at the global level, it is what is happening at the regional and local levels that will really determine how economies will weather the storm," she said. The report said the cost of damage caused by extreme weather events had increased from 9bn euros (Â£7bn) in the 1980s to 13bn euros in the 2000s. One of the report's authors, Andre Jol, head of the EEA's vulnerability and adaptation group, added: "We know that the main increase in damage costs from natural disasters has not been from climate change, as such, but more as a result of an increase in wealth, people and infrastructure in risk areas. "But one of the key messages from the report is that in the future, with projected increases in the frequency and intensity of extreme events, we know that climate change will contribute to the increase in the cost of damage from extreme events." 'Lack of action' On Monday, the World Bank published a report that warned that the world was "on track to a 4C [increase by the end of the century] marked by extreme heatwaves and life-threatening sea-level rise". It added that the world's poorest regions would be hardest hit by the warming, which was "likely to undermine efforts and goals". "A 4C warmer world can, and must be, avoided - we need to hold warming below 2C," said World Bank group president Jim Yong Kim. "Lack of action on climate change threatens to make the world our children inherit a completely different world than we are living in today." However, the UN Environment Programme (Unep) warned that it was still possible to achieve the 2C target but time was running out. Data in the Emissions Gap Report showed that annual greenhouse gas emissions were now "14% above where they need to be in 2020". Unep executive director Achim Steiner said: "While governments work to negotiate a new international climate agreement to come into effect in 2020, they urgently need to put their foot firmly on the action pedal by fulfilling financial, technology transfer and other commitments under the UN climate convention treaties." The reports have been published ahead of the annual two-week UN climate conference, which starts on Monday in Doha, Qatar.	The effects of climate change are already evident in Europe and the situation is set to get worse, the European Environment Agency has warned.
Police said the accident happened at just before 13:00 at the event in Blaxhall, north-east of Ipswich. The air ambulance service attended and the man was pronounced dead at the scene, a police spokeswoman said. She said there were "not believed to be any suspicious circumstances" surrounding the incident and a file would be prepared for the coroner. Club secretary Lyn Berwick from Woodbridge DMCC, which is based at the Blaxhall track, confirmed it was not one of their riders who had died, but said the man had been competing at the purpose-built circuit. At the time it was hosting the penultimate round of Eastern Centre Championship, with riders from across East Anglia. She said members of the club were with the deceased's family but declined to comment any further.	A man in his 20s has died after falling from his bike at a motocross event in Suffolk.
Daniel Jones, 58, who has admitted his involvement in the heist, offered to take police to the stashed loot. Jewels, gold and gems were buried in Edmonton Cemetery in north London. Three men deny conspiracy to commit burglary. A fourth denies conspiracy to conceal or transfer criminal property. Police searched the area and found two bags, one containing jewellery and another precious stones, at a memorial site for Sidney James Hart, the grandfather of Jones' children. Jones was then taken from prison and led the officers to another relation's memorial, where a smaller stash of gold, jewellery and gems were hidden. Prosecutor Philip Evans told Woolwich Crown Court: "He was hoping if he gave up the smaller quantity at plot GB177 he would still have access to the larger stash of criminal property, no doubt for his future use." Jones told police he was the only person who knew of the stash and declared "there's no other outstanding property. That is all I had", the court heard. Jurors were told earlier how the mastermind behind the Hatton Garden raid pulled out of the heist after failing to complete the task in one night. Brian Reader, 76, dubbed the "Master" by co-conspirators, withdrew from the raid when the gang struggled to get into the vault in one night. Up to £14m was looted from 73 safety deposit boxes in London's jewellery quarter two days later on 4 April. The gang drilled into the secure premises on 2 April but discovered the vault was blocked off by a metal cabinet, bolted to the floor on the other side, Woolwich Crown Court heard. The men returned with different equipment two nights later to finish the job, but Reader was not with them when they made off with the loot, which was later hidden in two wheelie bins and stashed in holdalls. Defendants and charges Previously John Collins, 75, of Bletsoe Walk, Islington; Daniel Jones, 58, of Park Avenue, Enfield; Terry Perkins, 67, of Heene Road, Enfield and Brian Reader, 76, of Dartford Road, Dartford, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit burglary. They will be sentenced at a later date. The court heard after the raid -  the "largest burglary in English legal history" - the gang stored the loot in two wheelie bins and some holdalls. Some was also hidden behind skirting boards and inside kitchen cupboards in their own homes. The plan was to convert the stolen goods into money, but initially they divided the proceeds between them, with the intention of keeping it hidden until publicity surrounding the heist died down, it was said. "When they were confident that had happened, they could split it up, melt it down, sell it or hide for a rainy day," Mr Evans said. Jurors heard part of the bounty was sold for sizeable sums of money. Officers swooped during one of the loot transfers to Mr Harbinson on 19 May. In the days before, police recording devices picked up Perkins boasting about the historic feat, saying: "And what a book you could write." He also described how some of the stolen "Indian" gold would fund his pension. The trial continues.	One of the Hatton Garden raiders buried his share of the £14m stash under two family graves, but tried to dupe police by just revealing one, a court has heard.
The West Indian Carnival in Leeds was launched in 1967 and once again will take over Potternewton Park for the August bank holiday weekend. An exhibition recording its heritage, political and cultural legacy is planned for the city's Tetley gallery. There will also be a week of new plays commemorating carnival at West Yorkshire Playhouse. Live updates and more from Yorkshire Additionally, it has been announced that an illuminated night carnival will kick-off the annual arts and light festival Light Night in October. A recreation of the Sun Goddess, the first Leeds Carnival Queen costume, will be featured at the exhibition from August to October. The celebration of food, music and culture will culminate again in a parade through Chapeltown and Harehills. An estimated 160,000 revellers attended last year's carnival, organisers said. Arthur France initiated it after becoming homesick for his native St Kitts and Nevis. Mr France, head of the organising committee, said: "When you come to carnival it is electric, so many things going on, beautiful costumes, beautiful colours, beautiful music." However, attempts to bring the parade into the city centre have been shelved. Mr France said he was "very sad and upset" at the council decision but added that it would not "dampen my spirits". Councillor Judith Blake, leader of Leeds City Council, said: "A lot of events are happening on the bank holiday weekend and with the advice it just wouldn't be possible." Ms Blake added: "The oldest carnival in Europe is here in Leeds. We are so keen to make sure as a city we come together and everyone celebrates an incredible achievement." She praised Mr France as a "legend" that had made "an absolutely fantastic contribution heading up a brilliant team of people".	Plans have been announced for the "oldest carnival in Europe" to celebrate its 50th anniversary.
Naming rights are among the powers set to be devolved in the Wales Bill now going through the UK Parliament. But Jane Hutt, Labour's chief whip in the assembly, will call for the Welsh Parliament name to be adopted "at the earliest opportunity", and used unofficially until formalised. AMs will debate the issue in the Senedd next Tuesday. Ms Hutt will table a motion proposing that "the National Assembly for Wales agrees that: (a) its name should be changed to the "Welsh Parliament" at the earliest opportunity; and that (b) it should be known unofficially by that name until such a name change can be formalised". A Welsh Government spokesperson said: "The First Minister is opening up debate among Assembly Members, early in the life of this Assembly, to consider the most appropriate name for the institution. "It is ultimately a matter for the National Assembly itself; legislation is not required to change what the institution calls itself." Asked for a response, a Wales Office spokesman said: "The Wales Bill will give the Assembly the power to call itself what it wants." Glyn Davies, the Conservative backbench MP for Montgomeryshire, said he would refer to the assembly as a parliament, saying on Facebook that AMs "should have done it years ago". In May, Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns spoke of the Wales Bill offering opportunities "to deliver a real parliament for Wales, with greater powers and a government responsible for raising as well as spending money". However, differences remain between the two governments on whether powers over income tax should be devolved without a referendum. Welsh Labour ministers claim that alleged underfunding of Wales by the UK Treasury should be addressed first, while some Tory MPs say their party should keep its promise to voters to hold a referendum.	The Welsh Assembly could be renamed the Welsh Parliament before AMs have the legal right to make the change.
The Times Educational Supplement (TES) says measures to guard against grade inflation were not appropriate for this year's English exams. Teaching unions have accused Ofqual of "regulatory failure" and say it is more evidence of flawed exam marking. But the regulator insists it applied its measures correctly. It comes as state and private school heads call for an independent inquiry into the problems. Last week Ofqual said it felt the way this year's English GCSE exams were graded was fair, despite the  grade boundaries being moved significantly part-way through the year. Teachers have complained that pupils achieving exactly the same marks would have received different grades depending on what time of year they sat the exam. And many who were predicted a grade C, obtained a grade D in their summer exams. Ofqual found that June's grade boundaries were correct, while January's were "too lenient". A key document sent to exam boards, which is on the Ofqual website, sets out how it expects exam boards to use a process known as "comparable outcomes" to ensure that grade standards are maintained between GCSEs year-on-year. It sets out five conditions for when such processes should be used to alter the way papers are marked. According to the TES report, this year's English GCSE and the circumstances around it failed to meet four of the conditions. The first of Ofqual's five conditions was that the cohort - or pupils from that year- in a subject "must be similar, in terms of ability, to those of previous years". But last week's report on English GCSEs noted that the "attainment profile" for 2012 dropped, as grammar and independent school pupils were replaced with extra, lower-achieving comprehensive pupils. The second condition was that the qualification must be "fit for purpose". On Monday, Education Secretary Michael Gove told Parliament that this year's English GCSE was "not fit for purpose". The third condition was that the "nature of the qualification" must be the same. Ofqual's report last week stated that "these qualifications are different from previous English qualifications in a number of ways". Finally, the regulator said in the letter that comparable outcomes must only be applied where "previous grades were appropriate". Ofqual's report said that the English GCSE grades in January were "too generous". The only condition that appears to have been met is that teaching standards have remained largely consistent. The guidelines also state: "Students should not be advantaged or disadvantaged simply because they were the first to sit a new set of examinations." The watchdog has interpreted its own conditions differently, and is insisting that the comparable outcomes approach that prevented grades from rising in June was correctly implemented. But Russell Hobby, general secretary of the NAHT heads' union, said: "Ofqual doesn't seem to have applied the concept of comparable outcomes properly. "In this instance there is a regulatory failure. It is a big mess." And Brian Lightman, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) said this appeared to be "another piece of evidence that procedures applied to this exam was not fit for purpose". Meanwhile, Ofqual said: "The comparable outcomes approach was used correctly for GCSE English this year and we stand by this decision. "Comparable outcomes are not intended to produce identical results year on year. "What's important is that outcomes can be compared when taking into consideration a range of factors which may affect the results. More details on the use of this approach can be found in our report." But Dr Christopher Ray, chairman of the Head Masters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC), said the issue was evidence of a deeper problem with Ofqual. "The verdict of Ofqual's initial report and the reasoning to support it fall well short of answering the questions raised in the minds of schools and pupils." Shadow education secretary Stephen Twigg said: "It is clear that pupils, parents and education professionals, across the spectrum of schools, feel that pupils have been done a disservice. "Whilst the Education Secretary Michael Gove says he is 'saddened' by the injustice that has been served to thousands of pupils, he is showing how out-of-touch he is with pupil opinion by refusing to take action. Labour supports calls for an independent inquiry to get to the bottom of this mess." The Commons Education Committee is set to start an inquiry into the GCSE grading problems next week.	England exams regulator Ofqual breached its own rules in allowing controversial changes to the way English GCSEs were graded this summer, it is claimed.
The supermarket's stock fell by more than 4% to close at 197.8p. Over the weekend, press reports suggested the deal faced a lengthy investigation from competition regulators. Shares in Booker also fell, with the FTSE 250 company down 3.6%. Overall, the FTSE 100 ended down by 66 points at 7,118.48. Most major stock markets around the world fell after President Donald Trump's decision to impose a travel ban on seven Muslim-majority countries. Among the gainers in the UK, Vodafone rose after the mobile phone company said that its Indian unit was in merger talks. A combination of the two companies would create India's biggest telecoms firm. Shares rose 1.3%. On the FTSE 250, shares in WS Atkins jumped 6% following a report in the Times that the engineering company had been approached by US company CH2M over a possible merger. Flybe shares dipped 1.1% after the airline said it had seen a "slow start" to trading since the start of the new year, blaming "uncertain consumer confidence and poor weather". That was despite the carrier reporting "solid" trading for the final three months of 2016, with revenues boosted by extra capacity. Flybe said passenger revenues rose 13.5% in the quarter, compared with 5.7% in the previous six months. On the currency markets, the pound fell 0.5% against the dollar to $1.2484, but rose 0.4% against the euro to 1.1682 euros.	Shares in Tesco led the declines on the FTSE 100, giving up some of Friday's gains when the stock surged in the wake of news of its planned tie-up with food wholesaler Booker.
Bailey, 16, was stabbed during a fight with a fellow pupil at Cults Academy. The schoolboy's killer is serving nine years for culpable homicide. The review, conducted by child welfare professional Andrew Lowe, made 21 recommendations last October. Mr Swinney will give a statement on Tuesday. The review found the pupil's death was "potentially avoidable".	Deputy First Minister John Swinney will give MSPs his response to a report into the death of Aberdeen schoolboy Bailey Gwynne next week.
Industry magazine What Car? says prices of VW models have not collapsed as might have been expected. VW cars which are three years old, or have done 36,000 miles, are typically worth 42.21% of their original value, the magazine said. That is 2.7% lower than in September 2015, just before the scandal broke. However, across the industry as a whole, second hand values have fallen by 2% over the same timeframe, suggesting that Volkswagens have performed only slightly worse than the average car on the market. "I'm sure there are motorists out there who were rubbing their hands in glee at the thought of used VW prices falling off a cliff because of the emissions debacle," said What Car? editor Steve Huntingford. "That simply hasn't come to pass, however, and while the VW story continues to rumble on a year after the story first came to light, the Golf and Polo are still among the most popular new cars in the UK." The German car-maker admitted on 16 September last year that software had switched diesel engines to a "clean mode" whenever they were tested for emissions. VW has recalled 200,000 cars in the UK as a result. But while it is offering to repair them, it is not offering owners compensation. VW drivers in the US have been offered up to $10,000 each to make up for the deception. The What Car? research suggested that cars made by VW under the Audi brand experienced a similar drop in value to VW-badged cars over the past year. It also found that the value of second hand Seat and Skoda models, also made by the VW group, fell by less than 0.5% over the 12-month period.	Second hand Volkswagens appear to be holding their value well, a motoring magazine says, despite the emissions scandal which emerged a year ago.
The home secretary and Tory leadership candidate told the Daily Mail it would be "sheer madness" to give up the UK's nuclear deterrent because of the threat posed by countries including Russia. Renewing Trident would show Britain was "committed" to working with Nato allies after voting for Brexit, she added. Labour is split over Trident, with Jeremy Corbyn opposing its renewal. Mrs May, seen as the front runner in the contest to replace David Cameron, said there was a "rapidly changing terrorist threat" from groups including so-called Islamic State and Boko Haram. But she disputed the suggestion this meant the UK no longer needed a nuclear deterrent, saying the UK still faced threats from "conventional enemies". Mrs May said this included Russia, which had showed "renewed beligerence" in its annexation of Crimea, and North Korea, which she said "continues to defy international law with its nuclear programme". Since 1969, according to government documents, a British submarine carrying nuclear weapons has always been on patrol, gliding silently beneath the waves, somewhere in the world's oceans. The logic is to deter a nuclear attack on the UK because, even if the nation's conventional defence capabilities were destroyed, the silent submarine would still be able to launch a catastrophic retaliatory strike on the aggressor, a concept known as mutually assured destruction. The submarines carry up to eight Trident missiles; each can be fitted with a number of warheads. Read more about the history of the UK's nuclear weapons system Pledging to make a "strong defence an important priority" if she is elected leader of the Conservatives, Mrs May wrote: "In the face of such strong evidence, it would be sheer madness to contemplate even for a moment giving up Britain's independent nuclear deterrent. "And there is no room for compromise, and no room for cheese paring. "We need a full fleet of four submarines, capable between them of providing what the military call 'Continuous At Sea Deterrence', or permanent, around-the-clock cover. "Doing so will send an important message that, as Britain leaves the European Union, we remain committed to working alongside our Nato allies and playing our full role in the world." Parliament is to hold a vote later this year on whether to proceed with building successor submarines to the existing Vanguard fleet, which is due to become obsolete by the end of the next decade. Mrs May said the vote should take place before the Commons summer break begins on 21 July, adding "we should get on with getting it built". She said: "A lot of parliamentary business has, for obvious reasons, been put on hold until the leadership election is complete and a new prime minister is in post. "But when it comes to the nuclear deterrent, the national interest is clear, the Conservatives are united, and we have waited long enough." Labour has become split over the renewal of Trident following the election of leader Jeremy Corbyn, who is a life-long opponent of nuclear weapons. Mr Corbyn is at odds with many of his MPs over the future of the UK nuclear weapons system - which the government has estimated will cost Â£31bn to renew - and has commissioned a review led by shadow defence secretary Emily Thornberry to look at its future, likely to report in the summer. He has previously suggested the UK could keep its Trident submarine fleet but without carrying nuclear warheads. The Conservative leadership contest was sparked by Mr Cameron's decision to step down as prime minster after the UK voted by 52% to 48% to leave the EU, in the June referendum. The other candidates are energy minister Andrea Leadsom, Justice Secretary Michael Gove, Work and Pensions Secretary Stephen Crabb and former defence secretary Liam Fox. Party members will choose from the two backed by most Tory MPs, with the winner due to be named on 9 September. MPs are due to start the first round of voting later.	There should be a vote in the House of Commons on replacing Trident before the summer recess, Theresa May has said.
Hend, 43, carded a one-over-par 73 to finish on nine under after the third round at Wentworth. Hatton, 24, birdied five of his last eight holes to shoot a six-under 66. England's Lee Westwood (68) and YE Yang (75) are tied for third on seven under, while Masters champion Danny Willett (76) is a shot further back. Hend complained after his round about the behaviour of some spectators towards him over the closing holes, as he played in the final match with Willett. The Australian said: "Danny was getting all the crowd support and I had no problem with that. But there were a couple of guys out there who were really over the top and it wasn't very nice what they were saying. "It was quite rude and personal and if it was up to me I would have had them thrown out. "Danny and I are mates. I've played with him before and he wants me to do well and I want him to do well. But when you get hecklers in the crowd saying pretty rude things as they were, I was ready to punch them." Willett again struggled on the back nine. Having coming home in 39 after a tournament record first-nine of 29 in his second round, Willett took 41 strokes on Saturday. The 28-year-old Englishman said: "It's disappointing to be somewhere there or thereabouts and then to play poorly on the back nine like we did yesterday. "We had everything under control nicely and then a couple of loose shots, a couple of bad decisions, a couple of missed putts and very quickly it kind of slipped away." Hatton, who has finished fifth, 13th and 12th in his last three events, set the clubhouse target more than two hours before the leaders finished after firing the day's lowest score. He said: "I've been walking around this place since (I was) a five-year-old and I was in awe of the guys inside of the rope. "For me now, playing my third BMW PGA, it's great. I love this event." England's Westwood is playing the event for a 23rd year in a row and is targeting a first win after a second-place finish in 2000 and losing a play-off to Luke Donald in 2011. Westwood, who finished second to Willett at the Masters in April, maintained his ever-present run after taking painkillers to help overcome a foot ligament injury sustained while running on Tuesday. He said: "For a pro to win the PGA at any stage in their career is special. But to do it at 43 years old, in my 23rd appearance and having been in contention a lot before, would be great. "I've played well here in the past and having finished second in the Masters and 10th in the Irish Open, I was surprised to be 33-1 going into this week. "I haven't played a lot at the start of the year, so I'm pretty fresh coming into this part of the season. Normally I would have played 15 events and I've only played six. I'm looking forward to a run of golf now." We've launched a new BBC Sport newsletter ahead of the Euros and Olympics, bringing all the best stories, features and video right to your inbox.

The visitors' swift, sharp passing and ruthlessness in the final third created goals for Andy Halliday, Jason Holt and the excellent Barrie McKay. Martyn Waghorn scored two penalties as Rangers made it eight wins from eight. In the home ranks, striker Derek Lyle was dismissed after going head-to-head with Rob Kiernan, with Aidan Smith netting a late breakaway consolation. Rangers sought to play with pace from the off, as captain Lee Wallace latched onto the lively McKay's pass at full tilt down the left, surging into the home box, but finding neither a team-mate nor the bottom corner with his bobbling ball across the face of goal. And McKay was instrumental in Rangers' opener, driving at the defence, exchanging passes with Waghorn, and playing in Halliday to clip the ball across goalkeeper Robbie Thomson. A knee injury deprived Rangers of their skipper shortly after the half-hour mark, before Hibernian loanee Alex Harris stung the palms of Wes Foderingham in the away goal with a driven strike from the right of the area. Minutes later Chris Higgins, who had already clattered the speeding James Tavernier early on, allowed Waghorn the opportunity to attack again with an awful looping backwards header in his own half, but made amends with a smart block in the box. On the stroke of half-time, Ryan Conroy wasted a fine chance for Queens on the break, as he opted to square for Lyle rather than shoot himself, with Danny Wilson sliding in smartly to block. Three minutes after the break, with Mark Millar booked for treading on the prone Gedion Zelalem, Lyle was dismissed on the advice of fourth official Crawford Allan. The striker went forehead-to-forehead with Kiernan, and the minimal forward motion he made with his head was in full view of Allan, who advised referee Bobby Madden to show a red card. If things were not bad enough for Queens, they got worse three minutes later, as Andy Dowie shouldered Dominic Ball to the ground in the box as the midfielder raced to reach Tavernier's square ball with the empty net beckoning. Right-back Dowie, who had been torn apart by the pace and trickery of McKay during the first half, was only shown yellow. Waghorn slammed home the resultant spot-kick, and from that point Rangers' high-tempo passing football was too much for the hosts. Holt ran unchallenged into the Queens area, and finished Zelalem's through ball at the second time of asking to bag the visitors' third. And more smart, intricate passing from Waghorn and Kenny Miller allowed McKay to tap home a deserved fourth on 65 minutes. Rangers boss Mark Warburton introduced the flamboyant Nathan Oduwa for the final 20 minutes, with the substitute drawing several fouls from the home defence. After Oduwa was chopped down on the edge of the area, Iain Russell raised his arm high to block the resultant free-kick, and Waghorn thumped his second penalty beyond Thomson. Queens did get off the mark in the final 10 minutes, young striker Smith capitalising on a long central punt and holding off Kiernan well to knock the ball past Foderingham.

The black and white story sees Patrick Troughton's second Doctor battle robot yeti in the London Underground. Also recovered is a complete version of Troughton's six-part story The Enemy of the World. It is thought to be the largest haul of missing episodes recovered in the last three decades. "It's thrilling," said Mark Gatiss, an actor and writer for the 21st Century incarnation of Doctor Who. "Every single avenue seemed to have been exhausted, every now and then something turns up - but to have two virtually complete stories out of the blue is absolutely incredible." The BBC destroyed many of the sci-fi drama's original transmission tapes in the 1960s and 1970s. However, many episodes were transferred on to film for sale to foreign broadcasters. It is often these prints found in other countries that are the source of retrieved episodes. In this case, 11 Doctor Who episodes were discovered, nine of which were missing, in the Nigerian city of Jos. The find was made by Philip Morris, director of a company called Television International Enterprises Archive. Mr Morris said: "The tapes had been left gathering dust in a storeroom at a television relay station in Nigeria. I remember wiping the dust off the masking tape on the canisters and my heart missed a beat as I saw the words, Doctor Who. When I read the story code I realised I'd found something pretty special." He said it had been a "lucky" find given the high temperatures in the African country. "Fortunately they had been kept in the optimum condition." Only episode three of The Enemy of the World already existed in the BBC archive. The Nigerian discovery of episodes one, two, four, five and six complete the story. Episode one of fan favourite The Web of Fear existed, with the rest thought lost forever. Now episodes two, four, five and six have been recovered. Episode three is still missing, but has been reconstructed from stills to enable restored versions of both stories to be made available for sale via download on Friday. The latest find means that the number of missing episodes of Doctor Who has dropped from 106 to 97. One episode from each story - both last seen in 1968 - were shown at a special event in London on Thursday by BBC Worldwide, the BBC's commercial arm. Among the guests were actors Frazer Hines and Deborah Watling, who played Troughton's Tardis companions Jamie McCrimmon and Victoria Waterfield. Episode one of The Enemy of the World is a James Bond-style thriller complete with an exploding helicopter, a hovercraft, gun-toting henchmen and a foreign-accented villain, Salamander (also played by Troughton). The story opens with the Tardis arriving on an Australian beach where the Doctor strips to his long johns and goes for a dip in the sea. The Web of Fear is a claustrophobic tale that sees the Doctor battle his old foe, the Great Intelligence, and the yeti in the tunnels of the London tube system. "It's the quintessential Doctor Who story," said Gatiss. "It has the return of the Abominable Snowmen in an iconic location." He said it showed Troughton "at the height of his powers". Frazer Hines recalled that the underground station sets had been so realistic that London Transport accused the BBC of filming at a tube station in secret. The story also featured an appearance by Deborah Watling's real-life father Jack, reprising his role as Professor Travers. Recalling Troughton's "wonderful sense of humour" on set, Watling said: "We all got on so well, we were like a family and Pat was always to me like another dad or an uncle.  We had a chemistry and I think it showed." How did she feel when she heard about the recovery of the lost episodes? "I couldn't quite believe it. There had been hoaxes before. I thought it was just another hoax." Her only other complete story in the archive had been The Tomb of the Cybermen, all four instalments of which were discovered in Hong Kong in 1991. Hines said: "This now gives me hope that more stories of Patrick's will come out of the woodwork." The latest find comes as Doctor Who celebrates its 50th birthday. A special episode featuring the current Doctor, Matt Smith, and his predecessor, David Tennant, will be shown on the programme's anniversary on 23 November.	Nine missing episodes of 1960s Doctor Who have been found at a TV station in Nigeria, including most of the classic story The Web of Fear.
The Slovenian club has knocked Hibernian, Rangers and Celtic out of Europe in recent seasons. Yet McInnes is adamant that his players are not fearful of the quality of the opposition or their record. "We're not daunted by it," McInnes said. "We're confident in our ability to get the right result." Aberdeen's manager has told fans to expect an assertive first-leg display on Thursday and urged them to back the team. "We've learned over the last few seasons to deal with European football," McInnes continued. "I like the technical and tactical part of it. Our supporters should expect to see a confident Aberdeen team. "They are favourites, we're the underdogs, but we were underdogs against Riejka [last season], we were underdogs against Groningen [in 2014]. "They'll take confidence from their recent history, and not just against Scottish teams. "We want to represent ourselves first and foremost, get the reputation of our club at the forefront of people's minds, and help Scottish football at the same time. "Those first two rounds always have trepidation about them, because players aren't fully up to speed, they're playing against teams that are relatively unknown and there's pressure in that. "We've now come out the other side of those ties and we're now the underdogs going into this game. I'm happy to deal with the favourites tag and happy to deal with the underdogs tag." McInnes warns that Maribor will be accomplished and dangerous opponents in the first leg of the third qualifying round tie on Thursday at Pittodrie. He will send his side out in search of a victory, but also with the awareness that the contest can be won in Slovenia on away goals, so keeping a clean sheet is important. "What was telling from [Maribor's win over Levski Sofia in the last round] was their maturity and calmness, even when they went behind they kept playing their game," McInnes said. "That comes from playing European football and they look like a team confident within their shape. They've got a way of playing, very well organised, and the refusal to panic when they went behind has got them through into this tie. "They play 4-4-1-1, they can play a bit deeper and they counter-attack quickly. We need to be aware of that and recognise the areas where we want to play and look after the ball, especially against a team that is quick to get forward. "We want to win the game at home, [but] it's important we still have a result going over to Maribor. "Ideally we want to impose ourselves and get that balance between attacking and defending right, but we don't want to be giving ourselves a mountain to climb by losing goals at Pittodrie."	Derek McInnes believes Aberdeen have the confidence and experience to overcome being underdogs against Maribor in the Europa League.
Marie Logie's body was found in her first-floor flat in Green Gates, Leven, at 20:00 on Tuesday. She had last been seen alive at 08:00 that day. Mrs Logie had sustained head injuries and was pronounced dead at the scene by the Scottish Ambulance Service. Her family paid tribute to the "beloved mother, grandmother and friend". They said Mrs Logie would be sadly missed, adding that she was "born, bred and lived in the Leven area all her life". "The family are assisting the police in the investigation and wish to be left alone at this difficult time," they added. Detectives said there were no signs of a break in and so far no clear motive but they said Mrs Logie was murdered in "a brutal" way. Mrs Logie was said to be independent, capable and was an active member of the local church. She had spent the festive period with one of her sons in England, returning home in the new year. Police said Mrs Logie's neighbour had spoken to her in the morning. She told the neighbour she was going to the shops and then to the hospital to visit a friend. When the neighbour did not hear from Mrs Logie again he went to investigate and found her dead in her home. Det Ch Insp Keith Hardie, of Police Scotland, said: "She had a brutal head injury. "An 82-year-old woman in the safety of her own home being subjected to such a brutal attack is horrendous." "Whoever has been responsible for causing Mary's death has preyed on a vulnerable and elderly member of the community and we are pursuing various lines of inquiry as part of this ongoing investigation. "I would ask that anyone who remembers seeing anything suspicious in the Green Gates area in the days and hours before Mary was found contacts police immediately. "In addition, anyone with any other information that can help us find Mary's killer should also get in touch." Mrs Logan's local Church of Scotland minister said the whole community had been "shocked" and "stunned" by the murder. The Rev Gilbert Nisbet, of Leven Parish Church, said: "Mary was part of the church community and very much involved in the life of the church. "I have been the minister here for nine years and she came virtually every Sunday and I would chat to her at the door. "Mary was friendly and outgoing, a kind lady who was bright and interesting to talk to. People are absolutely stunned."	An 82-year-old woman found murdered in her Fife home was the victim of a "brutal and horrendous attack", police have said.
The Posh lost for the third successive time since their cup defeat when they were beaten 2-1 at home by Oldham. "They're falling short of the standards that they're capable of, and they have done since the FA Cup tie. "I've got to believe that there's some sort of hangover going on," Westley told BBC Radio Cambridgeshire. "A young group of lads have built themselves up almost into a frenzy to go and play and win a massive game in their minds, they've got so close, they've given so much, perhaps physically and mentally it drained them." Tuesday's defeat kept Peterborough 12th in League One, eight points off the play-off places. Media playback is not supported on this device "I've tried to deal with it game-by-game through selection and through talking to them as people, but we haven't snapped ourselves out of this apparent malaise," added 47-year-old Westley. "On a motivational level we're not tracking back runners, we're not showing enough discipline to play the way we're coaching them to play, we're not showing enough belief in our game, we're slow, we're lacking urgency, there are so many things missing, "But I don't think they're bad people, I don't think they're downing tools and not producing the goods because they can't be bothered, I just think they've lost their way."	Peterborough United are still suffering from their FA Cup penalty shootout loss to West Bromwich Albion, according to manager Graham Westley.
The city's mayor, Joao Doria, said he did not want to see an "open-air shopping mall for drugs". He said he wanted to move the addicts on and provide them with medical services and housing. Critics say his policies are pushing the problem to other parts of the city. At the end of May, 500 armed police officers were deployed to clear the main streets in the area of Sao Paulo known as "Cracolandia" or "Crackland". Nearly 40 people were arrested during the operation for drug-trafficking and many of the addicts fled into neighbouring streets. The biggest concentration went to Princess Isabel square around 300 metres (330 yds) from the main Crackland area. During the second operation on Sunday police brought in bulldozers to clear the shacks and tents set up by the addicts in the square. The mayor said: "We wont be turning back. The idea is not to move them elsewhere,  we intend to provide the addicts with support and try to guarantee their survival." He has promised to restore and renovate the area providing social housing, schools, kindergartens and hospitals using private and public investments. Although many people agree in Sao Paulo over the need for intensive policing in the area, Mr Doria has divided opinion over his suggestion that the addicts should receive compulsory rehabilitation treatment. But workers say many addicts are fearful and hostile to them now and that Mr Doria's policies are destroying years of work building relationships with the addicts. Social workers also point to the need to provide jobs and housing. The Doria administration ended a programme introduced by the previous left-wing mayor of Sao Paulo, Fernando Haddad, which had offered hotel rooms in Crackland for a small daily sum to drug addicts who worked in jobs like road-sweeping or gardening. The mayor has instead recently announced an offer of 100 jobs by a fast food chain to homeless people in general, of which there are around 20,000 in Sao Paulo.	Security forces in Sao Paulo have cleared a central square of crack addicts and homeless people who fled from a similar police operation nearby nearly a month ago.
KPMG and the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) reported that the rate of expansion in hiring employees sank to a four-month low. The rate of growth in short-term jobs however had sped up since April, the report addded. It suggested that companies needed time to "digest the election result", which saw the Conservatives win a majority. The number of job vacancies made available also fell to their slowest in 2015. Although starting salaries for permanent employees continued to grow, the pace of growth sank to its lowest since April's nine-month high. Recruitment agencies reported that the pay of temporary and contracted staff also continued to grow, although at its slowest since January. The availability of temporary staff saw its fastest drop in seven months, leading recruitment consultants to report difficulties in hiring suitable people. KPMG partner Bernard Brown said: "The UK job market saw a slight slowdown in May, as those on boards took time to digest the election result and work out the ramifications for their business. " The public sector continues to suffer, with pay growth rising by just 0.2% in the last reported quarter."	The pace of hiring permanent staff in the UK slowed down in May, according to a report.
Leon Mugesera, an academic, was extradited back to his home country from Canada four years ago. He made his incendiary speech against the Tutsi minority in 1992. Some 800,000 people died in the genocide. Mugesera later worked as a lecturer in Quebec province and lost a 12-year legal battle to avoid extradition. In 1992, then an official in Rwanda's ruling Hutu party, Mugesera  told more than 1,000 party members that they should kill Tutsis and dump their bodies in the river. Mugesera later maintained his innocence, saying the speech had been taken out of context. The genocide ended when rebels, led by current Tutsi President Paul Kagame, seized power in July 1994. Militias from the majority Hutu ethnic group were blamed for the mass slaughter.	A former politician who described Tutsis as "cockroaches" and called for their extermination has been jailed for life in Rwanda over the 1994 genocide.
Forensic expert Susan Williamson was giving evidence at the trial of William Burns and Alexander Porter, who deny attacking Russell Findlay. The High Court in Glasgow heard she examined a jacket, mail bag, a knife and a jar that had contained acid. The jury was told DNA matching Mr Burns was found on the jacket. Prosecutor Richard Goddard asked Miss Williamson: "When you examined the jacket you obtained a DNA profile which matched William Burns," and she replied: "Yes." Ms Williamson told the court that she also examined the handle of the knife found at the scene and said the major DNA contributor was Mr Porter. The court was told the odds on the DNA belonging to anyone else not related to the men was a billion to one. Defence counsel Susan Duff, representing Mr Porter, said: "There are a number of ways DNA could have got there," and Ms Williamson said: "Yes." As well as working for the Sun newspaper, Mr Findlay is the author of books about Glasgow crime gangs. Mr Findlay has already given evidence alleging that a man claiming to be a postman came to his door at 08:30 on 23 December 2015. The journalist said the man, whom he identified as Burns, threw liquid onto the right side of his face and right eye. The jury has heard from an eye specialist that Mr Findlay's sight could have been saved by a neighbour dousing is face with water. Mr Burns, 56, and Mr Porter, 48, also deny attempting to murder Ross Sherlock by shooting at him repeatedly near St Helen's Primary School in Bishopbriggs on 24 September 2015. The trial before Judge Sean Murphy QC continues.	DNA matching two men accused of throwing acid at the face of a Scottish Sun journalist was found on items at the scene, a court has heard.
Edward Maher was questioning the soldier in charge of risk assessment during the exercise in July 2013. He said instructors did not notice for nearly an hour that his son, L/Cpl Edward Maher, was "overdue, over time, and off track" on the march. Fellow reservists L/Cpl Craig Roberts and Cpl James Dunsby also died. L/Cpl Maher's father questioned why a soldier, known as 1B to protect his identity, did not did not realise his son had gone "off track" until 16:10 BST when he had been expected at the next checkpoint at 15:34 BST. Soldier 1B explained he had only noticed L/Cpl Maher's tracking device on the screen at that time. Mr Maher said: "They were overdue, overtime, off track… do you think that your process had failed?" "At that time sir, no I [didn't]," the soldier replied. Earlier on Tuesday, soldier 1B told the inquest it was not in his thought process to stop the test because most soldiers were doing well during the 16-mile (26km) test on one of the hottest days of that year. He told the hearing in Solihull that of the 78 reservists taking part that day, six had withdrawn by early afternoon - two for medical reasons. But he said he was not concerned because the course was "tough". "They were all completing the march on time.... at that time the two casualties had recovered within 10 minutes… none of the qualified medics there told me they needed qualified assistance," he said. "All of the other runners were all within time… that includes Craig, that includes Ed, that includes James. "Were there alarm bells ringing in my head at that time? No there was not." David Turner QC, representing Cpl Dunsby's widow Bryher, asked 1B if he would have continued the march if commanding officer 1A had told him about the heat illness casualties. "I would have looked at what was going on… everyone is pushing themselves… it takes a different type of person to operate within that theatre, at that time I would have said it would not have been within my thought process to stop that march," he said. Soldier 1B said he told candidates to be aware of the hot weather and rising temperatures, but he did not consider heat exhaustion to be a greater risk than normal. He also said he was not made aware of new guidance on heat injuries and when an exercise should be stopped, following the death of a marine in similar circumstances in 2008. The inquest is continuing.	The father of a reservist who died after attempting an SAS selection exercise in the Brecon Beacons has told an inquest processes "failed" that day.
The 1,905 claimants had alleged they suffered harm while being held on PNG's Manus Island between 2012 and 2016. The government said it "strongly denied" the allegations but that settling was a "prudent" decision. Australia turns away any refugees and asylum seekers arriving by boat and sends them to PNG and Nauru. It says this deters migrants from attempting the life-threatening voyage to its shores in trafficking boats. But the policy has been heavily criticised both at home and internationally, including by the United Nations. The Manus case was due to be heard in the Victoria Supreme Court on Wednesday. But shortly before the trial began, lawyers for the claimants said the government and its service providers had offered a last minute settlement of A$70m. They also offered to cover costs estimated to be more than A$20m. The full details of the settlement and the financial package are yet to be fully approved by the court. Despite the millions of dollars it has cost, and the critical headlines it has generated, the Australian government is unlikely to regret its policy of sending asylum seekers offshore. Telling refugees that they will not be allowed to enter Australia until their case has been processed seems to have been a powerful deterrent. Just yesterday the prime minister boasted that more than 1,000 days had passed without a successful people-smuggling expedition to Australia. The more pressing problem is what to do with the hundreds of refugees who remain on Manus Island and Nauru. While the US has agreed to honour a deal to consider them for resettlement, it seems unlikely that all would pass the "extreme vetting" procedure. And with the Manus Island centre due to close in October, time is running out for a long-term solution. The principal lawyer for the claimants, Andrew Baker, said the settlement would help them to "put this dark chapter of their lives behind them". But Australia's Immigration Minister Peter Dutton said the government "strongly refutes and denies the claims made in these proceedings". In a statement, he said that had the case gone to trial it would have cost "tens of millions of dollars in legal fees alone, with an unknown outcome", and the government decided a settlement was a "prudent outcome for Australian taxpayers". As of last year, residents were allowed to freely come and go from the facility but the debate over their resettlement is ongoing. Australia has insisted that no-one held on Manus or Nauru will ever be re-settled in Australia.	The Australian government and its contractors have offered compensation totalling A$70m (Â£41m; $53m) to refugees detained in Papua New Guinea.
One of the 11 children described how the trailer went "really fast down the hill" at the farm in Nottinghamshire before it "launched us off". Two members of teaching staff from Halam Primary and a farmer were also injured in the accident on 11 March. The acting head teacher of the school has apologised. One of the children, Ben, said he was frightened and the other children were crying. "The trailer gone like really fast down the hill and it gone sideways and it launched us off," said Ben. When asked how it made him feel, Ben said: "It feels like sad." Ben's mother, Sheree Cockayne, said he has been struggling to sleep since it happened and has been having nightmares and flashbacks. Mrs Cockayne, who was told about the accident by a school nurse, said: "I rushed to the QMC (Queen's Medical Centre) and Ben was brought in. He had blood all over his face. "He just laid there really shocked. He had to stay in [hospital] overnight for observation every four hours because he had concussion and felt really sick. "He's still got bruises to his head, his ribs and his chest, so he still has a few pains." Nottinghamshire County Council said another child was discharged from hospital after a check-up and one was brought into hospital later in the day for a scan, then released. A teaching assistant sustained a broken wrist, a teaching student sustained a head wound requiring stitches and the farmer, who was also in the trailer, dislocated his shoulder. The assistant will be off work for four weeks. The children were on a trip at Hills Farm in Edingley and the accident happened on Carver's Hollow. Nottinghamshire Police is investigating the incident, rather then the Health and Safety Executive, because the area where it happened is a highway. The force has asked anyone with information to contact them. Hills Farm in Edingley, where it happened, said it would not comment while an investigation is ongoing. The school's acting head teacher, Paul Nolan, said: "We are very sorry this unfortunate incident happened and we wish the children and adults who were injured a speedy recovery. "This incident has affected the whole community and everyone is supporting each other as a result." Marion Clay, the council's acting service director for education standards, said: "This is an established trip for reception pupils and as far as we know at this time all the appropriate procedures were carried out."	A group of primary school children were injured on a trip to a farm when the trailer they were in became detached from the tractor pulling it.
Basil McAfee was found dead by his mother at his home in Henderson Avenue, north Belfast, on 20 December 2013. Police said he "suffered a violent death" and added that they believed his killer used an axe and a large knife. They said that although it was not a random attack, his killer remains a danger to others in the community. The police officer leading the murder investigation, Det Ch Insp John McVea, said: "It is a year since Basil died and his death has slipped somewhat from public consciousness. "But it remains an enduring heartache for his family - his mother, siblings and his grown-up children. "They are about to face a second Christmas without Basil and without knowing why this happened to him and who is responsible." Mr McAfee, a father-of-two, was attacked in the living room of his home and police have released a photograph of the murder scene as part of the renewed appeal. The 50-year-old had been stabbed a number of times and sustained head wounds consistent with being hit with an axe. The investigating officer described the murder as a "ferocious attack". "He suffered a violent death at the hands of an assailant who was probably wielding an axe and a long-bladed knife," Mr McVea said. He confirmed that items, including money, were taken from Mr McAfee's house. "Although we believe the attack was not random, but focused on Basil, whoever did this is a danger to others in the community while still at large," the detective added. The last public sighting of Mr McAfee was in an off-licence on the Cavehill Road, close to his home, on the afternoon of Thursday 19 December 2013. Shortly after the murder, police released CCTV images showing the victim shopping in the off-licence in a bid to get witnesses to come forward. However, they have now said they believe other people visited Mr McAfee who have not yet contacted detectives. Anyone with information about the case is asked to contact police on the non-emergency number 101. Alternatively, they can speak to the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.	Detectives investigating the murder of a man who they believe was attacked with an axe have renewed their appeal on the first anniversary of his death.
Tevez, who missed a penalty against Wigan last Saturday, was back on the bench for the midweek Champions League game against Napoli. Mancini insists that Tevez, who failed to secure a summer move away from the club, must accept the situation. "In this moment there are players that are better than him but Carlos is here training," he said. "Carlos will have a chance to play. I don't know if he is happy but every player that can't play is not happy. This is normal. "He will have his moment." The form of fellow strikers Edin Dzeko and Sergio Aguero, who have scored six league goals apiece so far this season, mean that the 27-year-old Argentina international's chances have been limited, while Mario Balotelli has also played just one league game. But Mancini believes his free-scoring side still need to be more ruthless in front of goal than neighbours and arch-rivals Manchester United, who have scored 18 goals - three more than City - in their first four Premier League games. When City underlined their title credentials with a 5-1 win at Tottenham last month, United bettered them with a 8-2 victory over Arsenal. Mancini's men impressed again by beating Wigan 3-0 last week, only for United to hammer Bolton 5-0. The Italian said: "Man United are a top team - they have been used to winning for a long time. They have strong players. "When they played against Arsenal, when they scored two or three goals, they continued trying to score. "We need to have this mentality. If we have a game like Tottenham where we can score, we need to continue to try to play."	Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini says Carlos Tevez must wait for his chance to get back into the team.
Media playback is not supported on this device Two-time double Olympic champion Sir Mo Farah struggled on the Holyrood Park course, finishing in seventh. Turkey's Yasemin Can, representing Europe, won the women's race, while Britain's Harriet Knowles-Jones claimed the junior women's title. Captain Laura Muir anchored Britain to victory in the 4x1km mixed relay. The team event was won by USA, with Europe second and Great Britain third. Hawkins, 24, led for most of the men's race until he was passed in the final 15m by Kenyan-born Korir, who won in a time of 24 minutes three seconds. "I put everything in to dropping him but he was the stronger man at the end," the Scot told BBC Sport. Newly knighted Farah, 33, finished 46 seconds adrift of Korir, with 2016 champion Garrett Heath of the United States in sixth. "It was a hard day at the office," Farah told BBC Sport. "I'm a little bit behind where I would usually be at this stage of the season. "But I'm not panicking this early on in the year - I've got to get ready for London 2017." With Farah out of contention early on in the 8km race, Hawkins took the initiative to break clear with Korir and Heath, before the latter faded. Hawkins, who finished ninth in the marathon at last summer's Olympics in Rio, repeatedly tried to drop Korir on the small rises around the course and appeared to have a winning gap coming into the final straight. But Korir, who finished 14th in the 10,000m final in Rio, won by Farah, had the greater kick in the final sprint to surge past the Scot and claim the title. "I was really tired at the end and he just wouldn't leave me alone," joked Hawkins, who will run in the marathon at this summer's World Championships in London. After breaking the 25-year-old British indoor 5,000m record on Wednesday, Muir produced a stellar final lap to secure Britain victory in the invitational Stewart Cup 4x1km mixed relay. Muir took the baton from James West level with USA but quickly surged clear as Britain won in a time of 11 minutes, 10 seconds, with the first two legs run by James Bowness and Charlene Thomas respectively. "In my role as captain I wanted to put out a good job for the team and when I saw the others placing well I had to bring it home for them," Muir told BBC Sport. "I wasn't used to being the one to watch but I'm there now and it's great - people are recognising that I'm running fast and I want to keep it that way." Elsewhere, Kenyan-born runner Can dominated the women's 6km event to win in a time of 20 minutes 36 seconds, with Ireland's Fionnuala McCormack, also racing for Europe, 21 seconds adrift in second. Noah Affolder of the United States won the junior men's race, with Scott Beattie the highest-placed Briton in eighth.	Great Britain's Callum Hawkins was beaten into second by USA's Leonard Korir in a dramatic sprint finish at the Great Edinburgh Cross Country.
Top-flight sides Birmingham City and Manchester City will meet at the national stadium on Saturday, 13 May. The attendance is now set to surpass the 32,912 that saw Arsenal Ladies beat Chelsea 1-0 in the 2016 final. Wembley staged the event for the first time in 2015 and is set to continue doing so for the foreseeable future. Birmingham - who won the trophy at Ashton Gate in 2012, in front of fewer than 9,000 people - are in their second final, while Women's Champions League semi-finalists Manchester City are yet to win the competition. The 2016 Women's Super League One champions beat Liverpool in this year's semi-finals, while Birmingham knocked out 2015 winners Chelsea on penalties.	The Women's FA Cup Final is set for a new competition-record crowd at Wembley, with 34,500 tickets already sold eight days before the 2017 final.
Michael McGibbon, 33, died after an attack in an alleyway at Butler Place, with police saying his killing carried the hallmarks of a paramilitary murder. The 34-year-old was arrested in Belfast on Sunday. Mr McGibbon was married with a young family. A priest, Father Gary Donegan, told the BBC's Sunday News programme how Mr McGibbon's wife tried to save his life when she arrived at the scene. Mrs McGibbon, who is a nurse, came to his aid shortly after the shooting. Police have said Mr McGibbon had contacted them to inform them that two masked men had arrived at his house on Thursday evening. The men asked him to come out of the house but he refused, and they told him they would return. Mr McGibbon's murder had been referred to the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland.	A 34-year-old man is still being questioned over the murder of a man who was shot in the legs in north Belfast on Friday night.
Lego refused a bulk order for bricks that were to be used in a new artwork about political dissidents as part of an exhibition in Melbourne, Australia. Toymaker Lego said it never sold directly to anyone wanting to use its product to make a political statement. The artist has since been deluged with offers of Lego from supporters. Ai used Lego last year to create portraits of 175 dissident figures who had been jailed or exiled, from Nelson Mandela to Edward Snowden, on the site of the former Alcatraz prison near San Francisco. He planned a similar work for the National Gallery of Victoria in Melbourne, but a bulk order placed by the museum was rejected by the Danish company. The Chinese artist said the company told the museum its bricks could not be used for artworks containing "any political, religious, racist, obscene or defaming statements". Referring to The Lego Movie's slogan "everything is awesome", Ai wrote on Twitter: "Lego will tell us what to do, or not to do. That is awesome!" He added: "Lego is giving us the definition of what is 'political', and all the big corporations are telling us what to love or hate. That is awesome." In an Instagram post, he wrote: "As a commercial entity, Lego produces and sells toys, movies and amusement parks attracting children across the globe. "As a powerful corporation, Lego is an influential cultural and political actor in the globalized economy with questionable values. "Lego's refusal to sell its product to the artist is an act of censorship and discrimination." Lego spokesman Roar Rude Trangbaek would not comment directly on the case but said that, as a principle, Lego "respects any individual's right to free, creative expression". But he added that the company had a long-standing policy not to directly sell to anyone if it knew that its bricks would be used to make a political statement. The artist also linked Lego's stance with plans for a new Legoland in Shanghai. Lego said the theme park was being built by Merlin Entertainment and not Lego, but that Lego does have some ties with Merlin because it uses the Lego brand. Ai Weiwei is known for his criticism of the Chinese government as well as for being one of the world's leading contemporary artists. He was arrested during a crackdown on political activists in China in 2011 and was released without charge after 81 days. The Chinese authorities kept his passport for four years, but it was returned earlier this year.	Artist Ai Weiwei has accused Lego of "censorship and discrimination" after the company refused to allow him to use its bricks in a new exhibition.
Two-year-old Hank was removed by dog wardens last month and taken for testing. A court in Belfast heard he had been assessed by an expert to be a pit bull terrier-type. However, it has been recommended that he be placed on the council's exemption register. Hank will undergo behavioural training and will also be kept on a lead and muzzled while in public. As the the exemption order was signed, one of Hank's owners - Joanne Meadows - broke down in tears in the public gallery while supporters applauded. "We knew what was happening today but it was just such a relief to know that it actually was happening," she said. "Until the judge said the words, we were just feared in case something changed, so it means so much. "I just can't get over that I'm going to be able to see him later on today." Miss Meadows said she did worry that this day may never come. "Even when we were told that was the decision on Thursday, I just didn't want to believe it until it actually happened because I just didn't want to get my hopes up because I just missed him so much," she said. A solicitor for the family thanked all those who helped with the campaign to free Hank, which attracted worldwide attention and support from celebrities including presenter Dermot O'Leary, boxer Carl Frampton and celebrity dog trainer Victoria Stillwell. An online petition to have Hank returned was signed by more than 280,000 people. Under Article 25(a) of the Dogs (Northern Ireland) Order 1983 some types of dog, including pit bulls, are deemed inherently dangerous and can be destroyed. Hank is the 12th dog to be placed on the exemption register since 2011. The couple have said their fight is not over as they believe the current legislation is fundamentally flawed and want it overhauled. They are planning a rally at Stormont next Sunday and said they  simply could not just walk away and leave other dog owners in the same situation. Hank's other owner, Leonard Collins said they did not think he would have been coming home so soon without the public support they had been offered. "Belfast City Council, when the pressure was put on, they expedited the process," he said. "We've spoken to people going through similar situations in England and here and it seemed to be that once this picked up public pressure, they wanted it finished as soon as possible." "We'd just like to thank everyone across the world, never mind Northern Ireland, Belfast, the media, friends, family, just everybody," Miss Meadows said.	A dog seized by Belfast City Council for "looking like a pit bull" has been reunited with his owners.
They are the stars of a new South Korean apocalyptic thriller terrorising audiences and breaking box office records at home and set to open in cinemas across Asia this week. Director Yeon Sang-ho's adrenaline-filled Train to Busan premiered at this year's Cannes Film Festival. Blood, brains and mayhem all feature prominently as hordes of zombies devour unfortunate passengers trapped on board a bullet train from Seoul. Train to Busan is South Korea's first home-grown zombie offering and has already achieved local box office success, taking a record $5.76m (Â£4.33m) on its opening day in July. The movie starts off with an innocent enough train journey, until a viral outbreak outside starts to infect passengers on board, turning them into the undead. The Korean government eventually declares a state of emergency and martial law. At the heart of the chaos is actor Gong Yoo, a typically-workaholic South Korean businessman travelling with his estranged daughter, oblivious to the unfolding apocalypse. The monsters are fast, really fast, and their attacks lightning speed, putting their Hollywood counterparts from World War Z to shame. Equally terrifying is the infection and the rate at which it spreads rapidly between those unlucky enough to be trapped onboard as the high-speed train races to its final destination. To young Koreans like student Hahn Kwan-woo, 23, it is the film they have been waiting for. "Western films featuring zombies have always been huge hits in our country and there was not a single Korean zombie movie until 'Train to Busan' came out," he said. "Many of my favourite actors also star in the movie." It may have all the predictable elements of a zombie story, but aficionados have also praised the film's uniquely South Korean take on the genre. "With a Mers epidemic [Middle East respiratory syndrome] sweeping South Korea in 2015 and soaring discontent with corruption and economic disparity, a zombie apocalypse serves as a potent allegory for the dog-eat-dog world," film critic Maggie Lee explained in one review. Stunning visual and special effects and "lean, gritty" screenplay also could not have hurt its chances of domestic success. Other critics praised the "brilliant" choice of setting on a Korean bullet train. "I even have a friend who loved it because she takes the same train every time she goes home," said Mr Hahn. But timing was also key, due to the appetite for summertime horror movies, said Jean Lee, a journalist and Wilson Center Global Fellow who also teaches Korean culture and film courses. "South Korean horror films really took off in the late 1990s and 'Train to Busan' is a new twist on the horror genre," she told BBC News from Seoul. "Most horror movies here are released in the summer, when the heat and humidity send people into air-conditioned theatres for movies that quite literally send a chill up their spines." Of course the best part about zombie movies is getting to see the best and worst of humanity, as the world comes to an end. "'Train to Busan': Best zombie scare ever. This is coming from someone who can't even watch 'The Walking Dead'," wrote one fan on Twitter, referencing the popular US drama series. Some even proclaimed it the "best zombie movie" they have ever seen. Fans like 24-year-old Oh Won-heo hope the movie will propel home-grown horror films to an international audience. "When people mention Asian horror, they think of Japan. But Korean horror tales are truly frightening and I hope 'Train to Busan' will make the world realise that our local movies are just as scary - or even better." However, he added: "For my sake, I hope Hollywood will not ruin it with a remake." On that point he may be out of luck - European and US film studios are already reported to be vying to make their own version.	Snakes on planes are old hat - it's zombies on trains you need to worry about this year.
Shiels, whose played for League of Ireland champions Dundalk last year, joins a club that plays in the tier below the MLS in North America. FC Edmonton are captained by former Linfield defender Albert Watson. "Dean's a goalscorer and a creative player who works at a level we would expect of someone at FC Edmonton," said Edmonton head coach Colin Miller. "Dean did very well for my old club Rangers and has had a fantastic career." The 32-year-old, son of Derry City manager Kenny Shiels, spent four years at Rangers where he played in two promotion-winning teams. Previously he had spells with Hibernian, Doncaster Rovers and Kilmarnock. The attacking midfielder from Maghera won the last of his 14 Northern Ireland caps in 2012. FC Edmonton will begin their NASL season in early April.	Northern Ireland strike Dean Shiels has signed for Canadian North American Soccer League club FC Edmonton.
The former Nottingham Forest defender signed for struggling Longford AFC in January in a bid to end its season-long losing streak and 178-goal deficit. He was due to get his boots on for the Gloucestershire non-leaguers last month, but the match was called off. A club spokesman said with Pearce on side, it was hoping to get its "very first win of the season" on Saturday. Rooted to the bottom of the Gloucestershire Northern Senior League Division Two, Longford AFC has lost all its games this season and conceded nearly 200 goals - earning it the name of "the worst team in England". But following their star January signing, club treasurer Mike Dean said the squad had been training hard and "games haven't been as bad". "We went down to Bisham Abbey - the old England stomping ground - a couple of weeks ago with Stuart and were training down there for about two-and-a-half hours," he said. "We have been getting beat but the scores are only 1-0, 2-0 - very low now.  So things are getting better and the confidence is in the side." On Saturday, 53-year-old Pearce - nicknamed Psycho - will be turning out for Langford AFC in a bottom of the league clash with Wotton Rovers. Simon Graham, Wotton Rovers manager, said it was "chuffed" but their right winger was a "little bit nervous" about marking an "ex-England superstar". "We've got a young squad and Stuart Pearce's legs aren't as fresh as they used to be so we'll run some rings around him," he said. Pearce, who won 78 England caps, was part of Sir Bobby Robson's squad that reached the last four of the World Cup in Italy in 1990, and the Terry Venables-led side that was eliminated at the same stage of Euro '96. He retired from playing six years after that, having enjoyed spells at Newcastle United, Manchester City, West Ham, Coventry and non-league Wealdstone, as well as captaining Forest under the management of Brian Clough.	England football legend Stuart Pearce is set to finally make his debut for a team dubbed "the worst in the UK".
The firm admitted releasing a quantity of benzole, exposing five workers to risk of death from flammable vapours coming off it, in June 2011. A Health and Safety Executive (HSE) investigation showed it failed to take appropriate safety measures. Tata Steel was fined £930,000 and ordered to pay costs of £70,000, at a hearing at Hull Crown Court. At a previous hearing, the company pleaded guilty to breaching the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974. More stories from around East Yorkshire and northern Lincolnshire The HSE said two of the workers involved in the incident were exposed to the chemical and suffered coughing and breathing difficulties. They were sent to hospital and discharged the next day. It said the release of benzole could have caused serious injury or death had it been ignited. HSE inspector Stephen Hargreaves said: "It was extremely fortunate no one was seriously affected by this incident. Had the flammable vapour cloud ignited this could have resulted in multiple fatalities. "This incident highlights the need for all duty holders to implement and address all concerns and potential risks which have been identified. "Tata's failure to do so in this case put a number of workers at risk of serious harm."	Tata Steel has been ordered to pay £1m after it exposed five people to toxic substances at Scunthorpe Steel Works.
The 23 year-old stroked the GB boat to a fast start and they were ahead after 500m but European champions, Romania and New Zealand proved too strong. The Romanians came out on top, with the British eight comfortably holding off the challenge from the Netherlands The GB eight now prepare for the World Championships in Sarasota in September. There was no medal success for Enniskillen's Holly Nixon in the women's quadruple sculls. Nixon and her GB team mates Bethany Bryan, Alice Baatz and Mathilda Hodgkins-Byrne, were always off the pace and finished fifth in a race won by Poland.	Belfast's Rebecca Shorten won a bronze medal as part of the Great Britain women's eight at the final World Cup regatta of the season in Lucerne.
That scenario once seemed beyond the reach of clubs that were being weighed down by the heedless spending of the past and drastic changes in the financial landscape of the game. What has brought about this shift, though? And what does it mean to the individual clubs and the state of Scottish football itself? There are a number of questions to ask about how the debt has been shed and what the impact might be. In terms of bank debt, essentially all are free of long-term liabilities now that Aberdeen have reached a deal with Lloyds Bank. Dundee United and Kilmarnock reached similar agreements last season, while Motherwell and St Mirren have been operating at more or less break even for a number of years. That said, the former often need the financial support of major shareholder John Boyle at points in the season and have been operating at a loss. Celtic have no bank debt and their interim results for the financial year to 31 December showed a surplus in the bank, while, through long-term planning, St Johnstone, Inverness Caledonian Thistle and Hamilton Academical are all free of bank debt. Dundee received investment from a US consortium and are now managed carefully financially, as are Partick Thistle, while Ross County's progress has been enabled by the largesse of the owner Roy MacGregor. Essentially, because Lloyds Bank had already written off the debts and there was no prospect of clubs ever being able to pay it back in full. Clubs have been fortunate that when Lloyds took over HBoS in January 2009 it provided a window of opportunity for the new owners to review all the debt on the bank's books. Any that was declared bad could then be written off in the accounts. With Scottish football unable to generate rising income streams - indeed, the league is still currently operating without a title sponsor - clubs saddled with large debts were ultimately able only to service them. Kilmarnock, for instance, owed £9.4m, having invested in the building of the Park Hotel next to Rugby Park. Last season, with the hotel valued at around £2.5m, it was sold to a company owned by Billy Bowie, with the businessman then converting the balance of the bank debt into equity. As a result of the restructuring, chairman Michael Johnston's 87% stake was reduced to below 50% and he was joined on the club board by Bowie and three new investors: Jim Mann, David Moran and Russell Smith. Yes, the bank's debt is being bought by Willie and Elaine Donald, who own the Stonehaven-based engineering company, WM Donald. Whatever sum the bank receives towards the approximately £9m debt is more than they expected, since in accountancy terms it was written off five years ago. The Donalds will likely convert the debt to equity at some stage and join the Aberdeen board. By wiping out the bank debt, Aberdeen have a little more financial freedom and can direct more resources to investing in the football side of the business. To an extent. The club will still have to operate at break even, since banks are no longer lending to clubs. They have to live within their means now that sources of credit have reduced or, as with the case of some clubs, disappeared completely. There will be more money available to Aberdeen since they will not have to service the debt any more, but it will not mean a drastic increase in available finance. Manager Derek McInnes won't be about to embark upon a spending spree. Dundee United will feel less constrained now, since selling assets was part of their agreed strategy with the bank to meet repayments. There is no essential need to accept offers for young players each summer, so the club can hold out for higher fees. The bank will have protected itself to an extent so that the debt reduction deal wasn't agreed only for the club to suddenly sell a batch of players and raise millions of pounds; percentages of future transfer fees will, until the end of next August, still go to the bank. Similarly, other clubs will not suddenly be able to sell their stadium having just agreed to a debt reduction deal. The bank was in a position to do these deals out of necessity but also desire, since there is no wish to be involved in football any more. There are also community and social benefits to striking the deals. It is too early to tell, but the best case scenario is that clubs are no longer on the brink of financial collapse. Also, there should be more leeway to try to hold on to their better young talents, although there must always be a recognition that English clubs will lure them south eventually. It is also often good for the players' career to move to a higher level, but they can move too early and become lost in the reserve squads of clubs when staying for longer in Scottish football will help them develop and boost the game in Scotland.	Debt has become a rarity in Scottish football.
The Public Accounts Committee says there has been a "systemic failing" in support to young people leaving foster care or children's homes. Its chair Meg Hillier MP says young adults are "let down by the system that's supposed to support them". The government says it is committed to improving the lives of care leavers. The committee found outcomes for the 10,000 young people aged 16 or over who leave care each year are "poor and worsening". Its report says the quality and cost of support to care leavers "varies unacceptably" between local authorities. Ofsted has rated two-thirds of council care leaver services inadequate or requiring improvement, say the MPs. "The scale of variability in the quality and cost of support, and a lack of understanding of what causes this, show that this is a systemic issue, rather than a problem in just a few local authorities," says the report. Young people must leave local authority care by their 18th birthday "whereas 50% of all 22-year-olds still live at home" it notes. These children have often had difficult lives with 62% in care because of abuse or neglect, it adds. "Those leaving care may struggle to cope with the transition to adulthood and may experience social exclusion, unemployment, health problems, or end up in custody." Some 41% of 19-year-old care leavers were not in education, employment or training in 2014 compared with 15% of the age group as a whole, says the report. It welcomes government initiatives to improve the lives of care leavers and acknowledges more good practice is emerging but says there is more still to do. "It's time the government reviewed its care leavers' strategy to make sure these young people get the full support they need," said Ms Hillier. The Department for Education should take formal responsibility for improving the system, the MPs urge. In particular they believe the DfE should improve care leavers' access to apprenticeships and training, suitable accommodation and better advice. Town Hall bosses said 40% cuts to their budgets meant providing care leavers with adequate support was "becoming an increasing challenge" which councils could not handle alone. "We urgently need to see the whole system properly funded and joined up to ensure children and young people receive the support they need, when they need it," said Roy Perry, chairman of the Local Government Association's Children and Young People's Board. The Department for Education said its reforms would help care leavers make a successful transition to adulthood. These include giving every care leaver a personal adviser and allowing young people to continue to live with their foster families after 18, though councils complain funding for the latter is "significantly underestimated". A DfE spokesman said the government was also funding apprenticeship programmes for care leavers and encouraging Ofsted to focus more on care leaver support. "But we want to go further, which is why we've committed to update the cross-government Care Leavers Strategy to improve support for these young people," said the spokesman.	Too many of the most vulnerable young people in England are "cut adrift when they need help the most", says the head of a powerful committee of MPs.
The former Liverpool boss succeeded Ronny Deila 10 days ago and has already moved into his office at the club's Lennoxtown training ground. Rodgers, 43, revealed he invited captain Scott Brown, 30, to his London home for a discussion over dinner. "It was good to get his opinion on how things are and how it looks for him at the club," Rodgers told Celtic TV. "It was also good for me to introduce myself to him as the club captain and talk through my ideas and how I'd like to work. "He's been here a long time, so he's been here through good times and tough times." Brown's fellow Scotland international Charlie Mulgrew, 30, is out of contract at Celtic and revealed that Rodgers telephoned him to ask if he would stay for another season. "I've spoken to a number of the players on the phone also," said Rodgers. The Northern Irishman will have six weeks to prepare the Premiership champions for their first competitive outing, in the second qualifying round of the Champions League on 12 or 13 July. "I'm really looking forward to 20 June, the first day back in and getting to meet all the players and talk through how we want to go forward," Rodgers added. "That's when the hard work begins. It will be a long season, a hard season, but it will be really exciting. I can't wait to get started."	New Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers says he has been discussing his future plans with some of his senior players.
The Hollywood A-lister turned up unexpectedly at Sunrise of Sonning, a care home in Berkshire, on Sunday to treat resident Pat Adams. Staff had written to Clooney, who lives nearby, telling him a visit would make Pat's dreams comes true. "This was a classy gesture from a wonderful man," a Sunrise UK spokesman said. "She was absolutely thrilled to meet her great icon, and it was such a lovely surprise to see George greet her with flowers and a card." The spokesman said Clooney was holding the letter staff had sent to him when he rang the doorbell asking for Pat. He said staff regularly try to fulfil their residents' wishes as part of an ongoing programme, but added: "They didn't think they would be able to pull this one off." The care home's concierge, Linda Jones, posted on Facebook that she was in "utter shock" when she saw the Oscar-winning star arrive. She said that Pat "loves George Clooney and mentions everyday how she would love him to meet him". Clooney moved to Sonning, where he lives with his human rights lawyer wife Amal, in 2014.	George Clooney has surprised an 87-year-old fan with a bouquet of flowers for her birthday.
Every week BBC Radio 1 plays a countdown of the week's top songs, based on downloads and online streaming. In May, the programme will move from Sunday to Friday evenings. CBBC will also launch a TV version of the Official Chart Show, presented by Cel Spellman. The new programme will be broadcast live from the Radio 1 studios and presented by Greg James and will play the top 20 songs of the week.	The Official Chart Show is being moved from Sunday to Friday evenings, as part of a big shake-up of the music charts.
In an open letter, he said he loved Russia, calling it "a great democracy". Mr Depardieu had recently announced he would give up his French passport after the government criticised his decision to move abroad to avoid higher taxes. Moscow earlier said President Vladimir Putin had personally signed the decree granting the actor Russian citizenship. In December, Mr Putin had said he would be happy to welcome the actor in his new country. "If he'd like to have a Russian passport, consider it settled," Mr Putin said. Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault had called Mr Depardieu's decision to leave the country "shabby". In the letter, broadcast on Thursday on Russian TV station Pervyi Kanal, Mr Depardieu said: "I filed a passport application and I am pleased that it was accepted. "I love your country, Russia - its people, its history, its writers. I love your culture, your intelligence." He said that he had spoken to French President Francois Hollande and told him Russia was "a great democracy, and not a country where the prime minister calls one of its citizens shabby". Under France's civil code, dual citizenship is permitted but it is unlawful to be stateless. A person must obtain another nationality before giving up French citizenship. Mr Depardieu's highly publicised tax row began last year after Mr Hollande said he would raise taxes to 75% for those earning more than 1m euros (Â£817,400). The actor accused the new socialist government of punishing "success, creation and talent", and announced in early December that he would move to Belgium. Although the Constitutional Council struck down the tax rise proposal on Sunday, Mr Depardieu said this did not change the situation "one bit". The BBC's Hugh Schofield in Paris says the series of events would be amusingly eccentric, were it not also serious in its implications for France's international image. Mr Depardieu, described by Mr Putin as a successful businessman and friend, has developed close ties with Russia, which has a flat 13% personal income tax rate. He currently appears in an advertisement for Sovietsky Bank's credit card and is prominently featured on the bank's home page. In 2011, he played the lead role in the film Rasputin, a Franco-Russian production about the life of eccentric monk Grigory Rasputin. In addition, Mr Depardieu has also helped raise funds for a children's hospital in St Petersburg.	Actor Gerard Depardieu has hailed Russia's decision to grant him citizenship, following a tax row with the government in his native France.
It would also cut foreign aid in order to spend 2% of GDP on defence. The party said there was "not a cigarette paper" between the defence policies of the Conservatives, Labour and the Lib Dems. The Conservatives accused UKIP of "playing politics with the military... in an irresponsible way". The dedicated veterans' minister would be part of the Cabinet Office rather than the Ministry of Defence. They would ensure veterans get specialist support, UKIP leader Nigel Farage said. This would include priority access to social housing and a fast-track card for NHS mental health services. During a visit to the West Midlands, Mr Farage accused the Conservative Party of being guilty of "shocking double standards" over defence and foreign  aid. The Conservatives and Labour have not committed to matching the 2% Nato spending target, which was met during the last Parliament, beyond 2016. Mr Farage said: "No previous Conservative prime minister in history would have countenanced sanctioning continual rises in foreign aid giveaways while at the same time pursuing a programme of continual cuts in defence." This election issue includes foreign policy and the role of UK’s defence forces at home and abroad. Policy guide: Where the parties stand He said troops who had served more than 12 years would, under UKIP, be offered jobs in the police force, prison service and the borders agency. Campaigners have long called for a national defence medal, awarded by the Queen, for everyone who serves in Britain's armed forces. Mr Farage said the medal could be worn by all veterans during parades, and would mean "millions of people would feel more engaged". UKIP say extra spending on defence would come through cutting the foreign aid budget by £9bn per year. Last year, the foreign aid budget was £11.7bn. A Conservative Party spokesman said the UK had the second largest defence budget in Nato and would spend over £160bn in the next decade on new military equipment. He added: "We've also enshrined the armed forces covenant into law so our troops are treated with the respect they deserve. "It comes down to this: you can only have strong armed forces if you have a strong economy first." Speaking to reporters during his visit to Dudley where the defence policy was set out, Mr Farage said UKIP's support had dipped since the "euphoric" feeling that followed the party's by-election wins in Rochester and Clacton last year. Everybody had "peaks and troughs", he said, adding that the by-election wins of Douglas Carswell and Mark Reckless had caused a "slightly euphoric" feeling among UKIP supporters but the party is "back a bit since then." This week Prime Minister David Cameron urged UKIP supporters to "come home" to the Tories, saying the general election was not the time to register a protest vote. UKIP called his comments "absurd".

It comes in a shake-up of UK military buildings and resettling of regiments. Brecon and Radnorshire Conservative MP Chris Davies condemned the closure, saying there had been a barracks in Brecon since 1805, home to troops who fought the Zulus at Rorke's Drift. "This decision is abhorrent and I shall be fighting it every step of the way," he said. "The government has a great deal of questions to answer over why it is proposing to close a well-loved and historic barracks in a vitally important military town. "Brecon Barracks has served our country with distinction over its long history, with soldiers from the site fighting in every conflict since the early 19th century. "This decision shows a blatant lack of respect for that history." Mr Davies said he was launching a petition against the decision, saying the Brecon area had some of the highest unemployment levels in Wales. He also hoped the closure would not damage the town's "thriving" military tourism industry. Brecon barracks has about 85 civilian staff and 90 military but it is not thought jobs are at risk. Mr Davies said he understood the nearby Sennybridge training ground and infantry school at Dering Lines would not be affected. Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon told the Commons on Monday the reorganisation in Wales would see a specialist light infantry centre created at St Athan, Vale of Glamorgan. Cawdor Barracks, Pembrokeshire - whose closure was previously announced in 2013 - will now shut in 2024, while a storage depot at Sennybridge will go in 2025. Responding for Labour, Shadow Defence Secretary Nia Griffith, MP for Llanelli, said the ministry was "right to restructure its estate". But she warned closing bases would affect the livelihoods of many people who would face "gnawing uncertainty" over their future.	The Ministry of Defence is to close the British Army's Welsh headquarters at Brecon, Powys, in 2027.
Cryptography was once controlled by the state and deployed only for military and diplomatic ends. But in the 1970s, cryptographer Whitfield Diffie devised a system which took encryption keys away from the state and marked the start of the so-called "Crypto Wars". Whitfield Diffie and three other experts spoke to the BBC World Service Inquiry programme about the tensions at the heart of the spat between Apple and the FBI. In 1975, cryptographer Whitfield Diffie devised "public key cryptography", which revolutionised encryption. "The basic techniques we used until public key cryptography come from around 1500 in the western world, and were known from about 800 in the Middle East. "They are basically arithmetic. Not ordinary integer arithmetic, but something like clock arithmetic - it's 11 o'clock and you wait three hours and you get 2 o'clock - and table lookups. What's the 5th element in the table? What's the 20th element? "The trouble is you can't do them very well without some kind of mechanical computation. A human being can't do enough of those calculations to produce a secure system without making too many mistakes. "Before what we did, you could not have supported cryptography outside a fairly integrated organisation. If you look at the US Department of Defense, it's very large, but very centralised; everybody knows the chain of command. "They can have a trusted entity run by the National Security Agency (NSA) to manage the keys [used by the military and government]. If you were in the military, and it was part of your assignment to talk to somebody securely in another part of the military, they would supply you with a key, and every morning you come out and put one in your teletype machine or phone or whatever. "But the internet is not just meant for friends to talk to friends, it's for everybody to talk to everybody. Until you have public key cryptography you have no way of arranging the keys on demand at a moment's notice for these secure communications. "That's what browsers do with websites all the time. Amazon, eBay, all of the merchants on the internet encrypt at least some of the traffic you have with them, at the very least the payment portion of it. "[At the time] the NSA reacted like any other enterprise that has had a monopoly in a market for a long period of time. Suddenly somebody was treading on its turf, and it made several attempts to recapture its market." Susan Landau is professor of Cyber Security Policy at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. "Public-key cryptography was mathematically elegant and also quite elementary. That's what made it so powerful and so wonderful. "The NSA said 'Wait a minute: this work should be classified.' They had been accustomed to being the only place that cryptography was done. They didn't want a competitor developing algorithms that maybe they would have trouble breaking into. They wanted to hold the keys to the kingdom. "There was a big fight between the academic and industry research community and the NSA. But it was settled fairly amicably, fairly quickly. The next problem was who would control the development of cryptography standards for the US government. "The NSA does this for military and diplomatic communications, but there's a vast need for cryptography for civilian agencies such as health and human services, education, agriculture. The National Bureau of Standards had been doing this in the 1970s but in the 1980s the NSA began pushing in this direction. "Congress, who had always looked more favourably on the civilian side, put the National Institute of Standards and Technology in charge. "But the law also included this little thing about three people from NSA approving certain things. They exercised tremendous control, and kept blocking standards that were more friendly to the commercial sector. That battle went on between 1987 until the mid 1990s. It was quite ugly. "Another battle was over the clipper chip. Clipper was a very hard algorithm with a secure key, but the key was split and was to be shared with agencies of the federal government. The idea was [that] a business person travelling overseas would be able to use a clipper-enabled phone and talk securely with the office back at home. "But if you're doing something illegal the US government will be able to decrypt easily, because the keys are held by its agencies. "It was a complete flop. Outside the US, no one wanted it. Inside the US, no one bought it. It was a total failure. "The controls on cryptography in the 1990s were very odd because they were controls on an export. If you wanted to export a computer or communications device with cryptography, you needed an export licence from the US government. "Much of the time you would get 'We're looking at it, we'll get back to you.' Of course, when you're selling high tech, you don't need a delay of two months, [so] you decide not to have strong encryption within the device - you put in something very weak that the US government will allow to go without a licence. The effect was to not have strong encryption domestically as well as abroad. "In 2000, the US government loosened the controls on export of devices with strong encryption; it looked as if the private sector won the battle." Alan Woodward is an expert in signals intelligence, intelligence gathered from communications, who has worked for the UK government in various roles. "Suppose you got intelligence that people appeared to be mobilising their military forces. You'd need to know whether that was a prelude to war, or just an exercise. One of the ways to do that was by analysing the signals and communications traffic going around on the other side. "In the early 2000s, it got harder. Previously they'd had the ability to decrypt things that were weakly encrypted. You could throw a super computer at the problem and try all the possible keys until you unlock the message. "You just physically couldn't do that for the number of encrypted messages that were starting to pile up. But also, the forms of encryption were becoming stronger. The encryption that was being used by governments themselves back in the 1970s was called the Data Encryption Standard. With a modern PC, you can break that in a matter of seconds. That kind of evolution in encryption and decryption has been going on ever since. "It got worse because there were various other forms of technology that were based on encryption, where you were able to remain anonymous, completely hidden. There's a thing called the Tor network which causes security agencies a great deal of trouble, because you don't even know where that person is based, never mind who they're communicating with. "Governments recognised that there wasn't a lot you could do about this technically or from a policy perspective. It's out there. So what you have to do is  be able to get at it before it is encrypted or after it's decrypted. "They recognised that they needed to work more closely with the technology providers because they were the ones that owned the infrastructure that was being used.  They were the ones running it; it was no longer governments and state telecommunications companies. "They had very good relationships. Microsoft produced a suite of software called Cofee (Computer Online Forensic Evidence Extractor), which is only given to government and Law Enforcement Agencies. It's a forensic tool that allows you to analyse Windows systems. "You used to be able to go along to Apple and they could unlock the phone. With messaging services it was possible for governments with the right authorisation to go along and sit in the middle of the conversation and look at the messages in a non-encrypted form. "All of that changed when Edward Snowden got his leaks out." Jeff Larson is a reporter at New York investigative newsroom ProPublica. It worked with the Guardian newspaper on the sensitive material leaked by Edward Snowden from the US National Security Agency in 2013. "I had seen something in the Snowden tranche of documents that made me suspicious that the NSA and GCHQ had been working behind the scenes to crack encryption that powers internet technologies. "When you log into your bank or Twitter or Facebook, your web browser talks to those servers over what's known as TLS, which is an encryption layer that protects the confidentiality of that traffic. "The intelligence agencies - not only NSA and GCHQ, but Canada and Australia and New Zealand- had spent 10 years and untold billions of dollars trying to break these fundamental encryption technologies. "They honed things, like their power with super computers, but they were also able to mount a programme of inserting back doors into cryptographic software, and - perhaps a bit more troubling - the NSA launched a covert campaign to influence the very standards that programmers rely on to create encryption. "So standards bodies write up 'here's how encryption works, here's how you implement it in your software', and the NSA was actually working against that effort. "Ever since [the Snowden revelations were published in] 2013, there's been quite a movement to further encrypt the internet. "I think there's been an awakening on the part of private companies that it is important to their users to keep [their data] confidential and secret. "Apple saw these revelations about the overreach of intelligence services and law enforcement services, and created a phone that was harder to crack because they wanted to increase the security of their users. I do believe that. "The Apple case is very hard. I see the arguments on both sides. I see the fact that the FBI wants access to this information, and I also see Apple's need to protect its customers' privacy. "I hope that we come to a conclusion that is more open and transparent. What I would say is I like that this fight is happening in public so that we can have debates like this." The Inquiry is broadcast on the BBC World Service on Tuesdays from 12:05 GMT.

The clash between Apple and the FBI over whether the company should provide access to encrypted data on a locked iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino attackers highlights debates about privacy and data security which have raged for decades.
The FTSE 250 company said this was due to customers switching less between savings and current accounts because of low interest rates. The news overshadowed the 16% rise in annual profits to Â£73.5m that the company reported for 2016. Another big faller in the FTSE 250 was transport group Go-Ahead. Its shares dived nearly 14% after the company warned of lower-than-expected full-year profits, partly due to the disruption caused by strikes on Southern rail services. Go-Ahead owns a 65% stake in Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR), which runs the Southern rail contract. Half-year profits at Go-Ahead fell 11.7% to Â£67m, and the company said its results had been "significantly impacted by a reduction in rail profitability due to losses from our GTR franchise, as a result of ongoing industrial action on Southern". The benchmark FTSE 100 index gained ground during the afternoon after spending the morning in the doldrums. At the close, it was up 10.44 points at 7,263.44. The biggest riser in the FTSE 100 was support services group Babcock, which rose 7.1% after issuing a positive trading update. On the currency markets, the pound dipped 0.13% against the US dollar to $1.2427 and was 0.4% lower against the euro at 1.1707 euros.	Shares in Moneysupermarket fell more than 6% after the comparison website warned that revenues so far this year were running below last year's levels.
Caitlin Ruddy had been with a group of teenagers on the north pier at Cullercoats Bay on Saturday evening. Northumbria Police said she was rescued from the side of the bay by a member of the public. Caitlin died in hospital after suffering a cardiac arrest. Her mother, Sabrina Cook, said she had lost her "everything". Mrs Cook has warned young people "not to take water for granted, because it is dangerous". "I've lost my daughter through it," she said. "She was stunning, she was my everything really, she was my friend." Caitlin's friends and family have been paying their respects at Cullercoats Bay, writing messages in the sand and leaving flowers. A RNLI lifeboat, a Coastguard search-and-rescue helicopter and police were called to the scene at about 20:00 GMT. Caitlin was taken to Northumbria Specialist Emergency Care Hospital in Cramlington. Another 15-year old girl, and a boy and girl both aged 14, were also taken to hospital as a precaution but were uninjured, police said. Ch Insp Paul Knox issued a warning that "people can be taken unawares by the strength of the waves" when it is dark and cold. "People should always be careful around water and if the sea is looking rough with waves pounding on to the pier, we would advise people to be particularly cautious and keep their distance," he said. A Cullercoats resident who witnessed the rescue operation said the weather had been "absolutely freezing". Newcastle University lecturer Clare Guilding said the beach was a popular place for teenagers to congregate. "It was minus 2C, but once you get out on the front it was just bitterly, bitterly cold," she said.	A 15-year-old girl has died despite being rescued after she was swept into the sea in North Tyneside.
Essex Police said two teenage boys and a man were taken to hospital after being stabbed in Colchester between 18:22 and 18:31 GMT on Saturday. As a result, the force's temporary deputy chief constable approved use of additional powers to search people. The "robust policing tactic" was used for three hours to "ensure order had been fully restored", the force said. A 17-year-old boy and an 18-year-old man from London were arrested, along with a 21-year-old man from Barking. Ch Insp Simon Anslow said none of those who were stabbed suffered life-threatening injuries. "This is a rare situation in any town and we are using the full range of legal tools at our disposal to keep the overwhelming majority of people safe, while making sure those intent on causing trouble will be swiftly picked up and dealt with," he said. "We will be pursuing a vigorous investigation to put all those we can find who are responsible for this detestable behaviour before the courts." The use of section 60 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 gives officers the power to search people for dangerous objects and weapons without the need to have a reasonable suspicion. The powers were in force in Colchester town centre from 18:40 until 21:50 GMT on Saturday. Read more on this and other stories on the BBC Essex Live page Colchester MP Will Quince said he supported the force's use of the powers in this instance. "Their swift action in getting the section 60 order, which is a rarely used piece of legislation, means they can stop anybody without reasonable cause to check if they have a weapon within a certain time frame - I applaud the police for doing that," he said.	Police invoked special stop and search powers after three people were stabbed within 10 minutes in a town centre.
"The rules of the game are changing," the prime minister declared. And he launched a 12-point plan of tough measures to deal with the threat of terrorism. I can remember writing them all down in my notebook and wondering when this bewildering list of policies was going to end. Chaos ensued. Opposition parties protested they had not been consulted. The then Labour chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee dismissed the policies as "half-baked". And Mr Blair went on holiday leaving his Home Secretary, Charles Clarke, to pick up the pieces. Day after day, there were emergency news conferences as the policies were clarified, rewritten and embellished. Some were quietly forgotten - such as new powers to close mosques - and others provoked divisive parliamentary battles, such as allowing the police 90 days to detain terror suspects without charge. The attacks transformed the politics of the summer. But the key point is this: Mr Blair had already won his third election in May with a healthy majority of 66. In contrast, Theresa May is dealing with her terrorism while the election campaign is still going on. For the prime minister, there are several lessons she could take from the experience of her Labour predecessor. Anti-terror laws made up on the hoof in the heat of the moment are not always the best ones. And laws do not always help. Since 2000, there has also been a lot of counter-terrorism legislation passed by Parliament and yet the threat is still there and very real. Yet Mrs May clearly felt the need to say something in Downing Street in response to the London Bridge attack that went beyond the usual condemnation of the violence, sympathy for the victims and their families and praise for the security forces. The fact that she announced some policy prescriptions showed that, in her mind, the need to be seen to being doing something outweighed the inevitable criticism of politicising the reaction to the incident. And, of course, a four-point plan was better than Mr Blair's 12. This was a recognition by the prime minister that security is now a significant issue in this election. Long after the rows of this campaign are over the government that is elected will still be facing the threat of Islamist terrorism. Where once the last few days of the election might have been focused on Brexit or tax or spending, much time and space will now be devoted to police numbers, intelligence capacity and extremist ideology. It is a political truism that security issues tend to favour the incumbent, allowing the prime minister of the day to look and be prime ministerial. It lifts them temporarily from the petty partisan point-scoring to the Olympian heights of statesmanship and all that a Downing Street podium can confer upon them. In times of uncertainty, the status quo looks attractive. As Belloc rhymed, "Always keep a-hold of nurse for fear of finding something worse". Yet for Mrs May this is a double-edged sword. Her security background gives her the experience and knowledge to sound convincing and credible on counter-terrorism. Yet it also gives her opponents a record to attack and ask what on earth she has been doing as home secretary over the past seven years to tackle the threat. Has she, for example, been increasing or cutting police budgets? Security is also double-edged for Jeremy Corbyn. These attacks have allowed his opponents to revive past comments revealing his reluctance to use armed force, to accuse him of consorting with members of the IRA, and to remind voters of his opposition to many counter-terrorism laws. But the issue also allows the Labour leader to surprise voters with a counterintuitive promise to give the police full authority to use force. It also gives him space to question some of Britain's alliances with countries in the Middle East from where some Islamist ideology originated. The truth is that the impact of such incidents on elections is not straightforward. In Israel, for instance, what are considered to be terror attacks tend to favour parties of the right over parties of the left. But the evidence elsewhere appears inconsistent and sketchy. The terror attack in Paris this April did not help the Front National leader, Marine Le Pen. But in Spain in 2004, the attack on Madrid's commuter trains that killed 192 people - just three days before polling - did not help save the ruling centre-right Popular Party from defeat. The bottom line, perhaps, is that many voters in Britain will have seen terrorism before. And they will see it as just one issue among many on which they can base their vote. They also know that elections are about choosing a government for potentially five years and knee-jerk decisions are not always best for the long-term.	After the bomb attacks on London in July 2005, Tony Blair summoned the media to Downing Street for a news conference.
Highways England plans to "increase capacity and reduce congestion" between Worthing and Lancing. But Adur and Worthing councils say the Â£69m proposal is not fit for purpose and the government body should launch a fresh consultation with updated plans. Highways England project manager Tom Beasley said the improvements were the "best achievable option". Large-scale options were considered by Highways England, including dual carriageway schemes with flyovers. But the consultation focuses a mix of new traffic signalling and road widening on six junctions between Durrington Hill and the Lancing Manor roundabout. In a joint statement, the leader of Adur District Council, Neil Parkin, and the leader of Worthing Borough Council, Dan Humphreys, said the "modest" plans are not good enough. Mr Parkin said: "Highways England say they want to consult with us but we say this is a sham. By not allowing the public to weigh up options and see full costings how are we to make any kind of decision? "All I do know is the current scheme on the table is barely worth the disruption and certainly not worth spending Â£69m on." Mr Humphreys added: "Highways England do not seem to be taking us seriously. Our questions were met with an 'experts know best' response." But Mr Beasley said Highways England think that the proposal "would make a worthwhile improvement to people's journeys and is the best achievable option within the scope and budget available for the project". "We welcome all views and promise that we will take all responses to the consultation fully into account." Consultation into the proposal ends on 12 September.	A consultation into improvements on the A27 has been dubbed "a sham" by council leaders.
A 30ft (9m) decomposed whale washed up on the beach at Felixstowe on Sunday and the body of a minke whale was spotted near Orford on Saturday. Scientists from the Cetaceans Strandings Investigation Programme (CSIP) say there is now a third dead whale off the coast. They do not think the deaths are linked. The third whale floating off the Suffolk coast is thought to be a sperm whale, Rob Deaville, from CSIP, said. More on this and other news from Suffolk He believes the whale on the beach at Felixstowe is a fin whale and a large injury on its body is the result of it being struck by a vessel "some time ago, perhaps hundreds of miles away". CSIP - which attends cases of whales, porpoises and dolphins that become stranded on the UK coastline - is currently examining the Felixstowe whale. It is too decomposed to carry out a full post-mortem test but samples have been taken to assist with analysis in terms of whale population, Mr Deaville said. The Orford whale stranded on mud flats on the tidal River Ore will be "tricky to get to", Mr Deaville said. However, he does not believe the deaths are in any way related. "Three very different species, and in my opinion, they're not linked," he said. "It's a series of coincidental events. "We see hundreds of strandings a year, it just happens that these three are in close proximity." A spokeswoman for Suffolk Coastal and Waveney Councils said contractors were expected to remove the whale from the beach at Felixstowe on Wednesday. It is not yet known when the body of the Orford whale will be moved.	A third dead whale has been found by experts investigating the deaths of two others found along the Suffolk coast.
BBC Radio 5 live found football ticket-touting laws are being flouted, leaving fans vulnerable to online brokers. Some ticketing websites have deals with clubs but others could be "duping" customers on "an industrial scale". The FSF says supporters "would not mind paying an administration fee" to clubs to keep secondary ticket prices down. "Any company that gets between fans and a club will try to make a profit," Michael Brunskill, FSF spokesperson, which represents the rights of football supporters in England and Wales, told BBC Sport. "We understand fans might want to sell on tickets because they can't make it to a game, but our preference would be that clubs manage that." Arsenal are one club that already provides an in-house service where season ticket holders who cannot attend a game can resell tickets to members. The club says that 50,000 tickets were redistributed through their exchange last season, with 44,000 so far this season. The general resale of football tickets was banned in 1994 because of safety fears over the possibility of rival fans mingling together. Only outlets officially authorised by clubs can offer unwanted seats, with Everton and Tottenham having deals with one firm, Stubhub. Another website, Twickets, has a deal with Crystal Palace where tickets cannot be sold for more than face value. But overseas firms can avoid UK consumer law and the Society of Ticket Agents & Retailers warns the online trade allows unscrupulous firms to "dupe unsuspecting ticket buyers". Under UK law, tickets advertised must include the cost and location of seats in the stadium, but during its research 5 live Investigates found many examples where this did not happen or the tickets arrived late. The investigation also found that Premier League tickets with a face value of £23 were being be resold for as much as £130 each. In a bid to clamp down on illegal trading, Manchester United have seized more than 1,750 tickets during the past two seasons. One firm, Ticketbis, was found to have distributed season tickets and it was also claimed it was reselling tickets associated with people already banned from a stadium. When asked to respond to the allegations, Ticketbis, which is based in Spain, said it is a "secure online platform that works as an intermediary between individuals that want to buy and sell tickets in 40 countries". The company did not comment on the illegal sale of football tickets. Brunskill added: "It's important fans understand there are different types of secondary ticket companies. Some have no affiliation with football clubs, and are often based offshore so are not subject to UK law. "If anyone is planning to buy tickets, do your research because with these companies there is a danger that your tickets don't turn up. "There is a place in the market for the fair reselling of tickets and we would like clubs to use their own in-house systems."	Clubs could prevent fans being ripped off by creating their own secondary ticket exchanges, says the Football Supporters' Federation (FSF).
The world number one, 32, beat Waters 11-2 11-5 11-4 in just 24 minutes at the National Squash Centre to secure a first national title since 2012. "I am really happy that I played well all week to win the title again," she told the tournament website. In the men's event, Nick Matthew beat James Willstrop 11-2 6-11 11-3 11-3 to win his eighth British title. World number three Matthew, 35, lost his first set of the week but recovered to win the final in 50 minutes.	Laura Massaro won her third British title with a straight-set final victory over Alison Waters in Manchester.
Zaneta Krokova, 11, and Helina Kotlarova, 12, who were "holding hands" as they crossed the road, died after the crash on Ashton Road. Four men, aged 59, 48, 38 and 18, remain in custody on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving. A fifth man, aged 23, has been de-arrested, police said. Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said he was initially arrested for the same offence but was now assisting police with enquiries. Greater Manchester Police said it had identified the car involved in the collision as a Blue Peugeot 807. The dark blue vehicle, which had evidence of previous damage to its rear window, was found abandoned on Honeywell Lane. Nigel Whittle, principal of Oasis Academy, Oldham, said the school was "deeply saddened" by the news of the deaths of Zaneta, who was a first year student, and her cousin Helina Kotlarova, a former pupil. He said: "Our thoughts and prayers are with their families and friends at this extremely distressing and difficult time. "We are a very closely-knit school community.  As our students return following the Christmas break, I know that they will care for one another, and our staff will be available to offer the support and time necessary as we all come to terms with this awful loss." He said with the agreement of the Krokova family the school would join together to pay tribute to Zaneta in the coming weeks. A book of condolence would be opened on Thursday, he said.	Police have been given more time to question four men held over an apparent hit-and-run crash in Oldham on New Year's Eve in which two cousins died.
There has been damage to property but no injuries. Forecasters have indicated that it will be dry and bright for most of Scotland by Wednesday afternoon. Ferry services have been considerably disrupted and falling trees have caused some problems on roads and railways. Transport Minister Keith Brown chaired a meeting of the Scottish government's resilience team. Mr Brown said: "No-one is being complacent and whilst the weather alerts remain in place, the focused response will continue." A train travelling south from Aberdeen to Edinburgh suffered minor damage when it hit some fallen branches and a bus was hit in Aberdeen. In Edinburgh a tree landed on the side of a house in Redford Road. No-one was injured. High winds has also forced the closure of the Royal Botanic Garden in the capital. Aberdeen City Council said trees were down across the city, and the tree squad was working flat out. Huge quantities of foam blown in from the sea covered cars, buildings and a park beside Aberdeen beach at the Footdee area. Scottish Borders Council activated its emergency response team after warnings of extremely heavy rain, while Tayside Police warned of an increased risk of surface water on many routes and possible river flooding. Part of a building roof has come down blocking Bridge Street at Peterhead harbour and Grampian Police said minor roads across the region have been blocked by trees. High winds have seen restrictions on some of Scotland's bridges, while fallen trees are affecting some minor routes and ferry crossings. Historic Scotland has shut several of its sites across the country including: Fort George, Craigmillar Castle, Loch Leven castle, Inchcolm Abbey, Tantallon Castle, Seton Collegiate Church, Tolquhon Castle, Kisimul Castle, Spynie Palace, Elgin Cathedral and Inchmahone Priory. The National Trust for Scotland has closed: Brodie Castle, Newhailes, Pitmedden, Preston Mill, Fyffie castle, Haddo House, Castle Fraser, Leith Hall Gardens, Crathes Castle, Craigevar Castle, Drum Castle and Crarae Gardens.	Heavy rain and severe winds have caused power cuts and travel problems and swept sea foam into parts of Scotland.
The poster, on Tamworth Road, in Sawley, Derbyshire, shows aliens beaming up a person into their spaceship with the text, "they'll take the fat ones first". Combat Bullying, based in Nottinghamshire, said it would "further harm" those who are being bullied. Fit4Less said it wanted to create a "light-hearted and humorous" advert. It reads: "They're comingâ€¦ and when they arrive they'll take the FAT ones first!". It then has "save yourself!" with an arrow pointing to the gym's website. One passer-by said the poster was "ridiculous" and he would "rip it down" because "being a big lad myself, it upsets you". Many other people said it was "in poor taste" and "offensive". Natalie Harvey, founder of the charity, said the poster has caused her concerns because it would "aid bullying". "This week alone three cases have been brought to my attention of children being bullied because of weight issues," she said. "If those children or the perpetrators saw this poster it would cause further harm for the children who are being bullied. "The poster should be removed and replaced with something more tasteful to attract the gym goers." Kerry Matthews, from the gym in Long Eaton, Derbyshire, said: "We really didn't mean it offensively. "It was supposed to be a bit cheeky, hence the alien image, and grab people's attention in a couple of seconds. "So many campaigns use ultra skinny people and that's not the reality." Ms Matthews added that the gym wanted to get people talking about getting fitter.	An anti-bullying charity has called for a gym billboard poster to be removed for being "offensive".
The 40-year-old 14-time major champion twice had back surgery during 15 months out before returning in December, when he tied for 15th at the 17-man Hero World Challenge. Over the next five weeks he plays four full-field tournaments. "That is a concern, no doubt about it, but I'm also looking forward to it. I've sat out long enough," Woods said. "I've gone through some pretty tough lows. There were points when I didn't know whether I would swing a golf club again. "But I do feel good about it. I just need to get out there and do it and see what happens." Woods begins his 2017 season at the Farmers Insurance Open in San Diego, which begins on Thursday. He will then play at the Dubai Desert Classic from 2-5 February, followed by the Genesis Open at Riviera from 16-19 February and the Honda Classic in Palm Beach Gardens from 23-26 February. "I've got my body in a pretty good state where I feel I can handle that workload, but I've still got to go out there and do it," he added. "Feeling good about it and doing it are two totally different things." Media playback is not supported on this device	Tiger Woods admits he has concerns over the physical challenge of stepping up his return from long-term injury.
The 45-year-old, who had a spell as a player at Headingley between 1990 and 1995, spent eight years as Essex coach before leaving at the end of 2015. He replaces Richard Pyrah as Diamonds boss, with the latter to assist new Yorkshire head coach Andrew Gale. "The opportunity to work with an elite female team is really exciting for me," Grayson told the club website. Yorkshire Diamonds will start their 2017 Super League campaign with a Roses game against Lancashire Thunder on 11 August. The two sides won only one game each in the round-robin group stage of the inaugural competition last summer.	Yorkshire Diamonds have appointed Paul Grayson as their head coach on a deal until the end of 2019.
The environment department says what should be a carpet of blue at this time of year is now fringed with white. Commonly known as wild garlic, the alium was introduced as a garden plant but it escaped and is now rampant in woods and hedgerows. Plant expert Jane Gilmour from the Biological Records Centre is advising gardeners to get rid of the invader. Its leaves appear in the autumn which means the department can use contact weed killer to tackle the problem without harming the bluebell bulbs. Ms Gilmour said: "Sometimes called stinking onions, this is from the Mediterranean. It has increased massively in numbers in the past few years. "The milder weather and generally milder winters have suited it brilliantly and it is out-competing bluebells as it comes into leaf just a little bit earlier. "It is one of those plants people are staring to realise is a thug."	Bluebell woods in Guernsey are being invaded by a non-native species, environmentalists say.
The family had asked that half the remains be returned to them with the other half scattered in the grounds. Half were returned but the remainder had been wrongly used in an un-witnessed scattering earlier that day at  Weston Crematorium, Worle. The two workers lost their jobs and Dignity, which runs the crematorium, apologised for the family's distress. Instead of admitting their mistake, two members of staff, who have been described as "very experienced", tried to cover it up by using another person's ashes for the ceremony in front of the family. Eventually, they admitted what they had done to their manager, and Dignity - which runs the crematorium on behalf of North Somerset Council - started an "extensive" disciplinary hearing. In a statement Dignity said it was an "isolated incident" and would look at why "very experienced staff failed to follow our established procedures". "Following disciplinary hearings, two employees are no longer in our employment. The family and North Somerset Council have been kept fully informed throughout." A North Somerset Council spokesman said Dignity had kept it "fully informed during the process". "We are satisfied that they have investigated the matter thoroughly."	The ashes of a stranger were scattered in front of a family by two cemetery workers trying to cover up a mistake.
As first reported by The Express, the settled community in the Hovefields area of Wickford reported hardcore-laden lorries arrive at the weekend. The lorries were followed by large mobile homes. Basildon Council said it is aware of "an alleged breach of planning laws". Essex Police has also been informed. The Hovefield site - which is subject to a High Court injunction preventing further development - is less than three miles (5km) by road - from the Dale Farm traveller site in Wickford. Dale Farm was Europe's largest traveller site before about 80 families were evicted from unlawful plots in 2011. Jill Walsh, of the Hovefields Residents Association, said an English Traveller family in five caravans left the site on Friday. After they departed, she said, a number of large lorries carrying concrete, hardcore and three mobile homes drove down Hovefields Avenue and onto the five acre field at the end of the road. Mrs Walsh said because of the narrowness of the road one of their neighbours - an elderly couple - had their fence ripped out and shrubbery damaged so that the lorries could get through. "If the council does not prosecute over this and deal with the situation urgently they will have a Dale Farm II, but bigger." Phil Turner, leader of Basildon Council, said: "Basildon Council is aware of an alleged breach of planning laws in the Hovefields area. "We share the frustrations of residents, but the council does not have powers of arrest and must follow the proper legal process. "As a public body, we must act within the existing legal framework, as set out by Parliament, and this adds considerable time and cost in dealing with such situations. "However, residents can be assured that the council is taking all appropriate steps to deal with unauthorised development." Essex Police said it was investigating a criminal damage report involving the fence and has urged any witnesses to contact them. A police spokesman said: "Essex Police is aware of an unauthorised traveller development on land near Hovefields Avenue. "We are liaising with the local authority and will continue to monitor the situation."	Residents have called for urgent action amid claims that a new mass Traveller site is being created at the end of their road in Essex.
Attendances have fallen in recent years since the Premiership side moved from Edgeley Park in Stockport to AJ Bell Stadium in Barton in 2012. Sale have moved home games back to Friday nights for the upcoming season. "I think there is some rebuilding to do because I think people in the early days of moving have had a pretty poor experience," Cotton told BBC Sport. "That could be queuing up on a motorway, couldn't get away from the stadium, couldn't buy a drink at the ground. Listening to the things we're going to do to change that, if people come down from now they will find a very different experience. "The infrastructure is still well away from where it needs to be but there are plans to develop that." Cotton, 69, a former England and British and Irish Lions prop returned to Sale - a club he served as both a player and director - after Simon Orange's takeover of the Premiership side in June. He has promised to be active in his role, despite his commitments with his clothing business. "What I really want to see is a very strong north of England club that can compete at the highest level," he added. "That is my motivation for giving up the precious thing that I have got, and that is my time. "I think what was lacking before was that the board weren't very often represented at games home and away, and I think that is very wrong - board members will travel to away games and home games." One of the standout announcements from Sale's new 10-man board was that director of rugby Steve Diamond will have a seat on it. However, Cotton insists there will be no conflict of interest with a member of the coaching staff also working as a director. "It will put no strain whatsoever on the relationship, we're here to support him," Cotton continued. "We'll be working very closely with Diamond to make sure we can achieve the ambition which we all hold - if we went down we'd still be with them." Diamond also confirmed they are close to signing a new full-back and are still looking for another player to add to their backline, with former Bath and London Welsh winger Nick Scott on trial with the club.	New Sale Sharks chairman Fran Cotton has conceded they must work to restore their relationship with some fans.
The visitors led when Simon Makienok finished calmly for his second league goal this season from Greg Cunningham's pass just before the interval. Forest improved after the break and they levelled when Thomas Lam's volley went in via the post and Preston goalkeeper Chris Maxwell. Makienok and Alan Browne forced fine saves from Forest's Vladimir Stojkovic as the match finished level. Forest, who had been hammered 3-0 at rivals Derby on Sunday, started slowly and could have fallen behind in the opening minutes when Stojkovic saved brilliantly from Callum Robinson before later diverting Browne's strike from range onto the post. Nicklas Bendtner should have put the hosts in front when he fired over from Eric Lichaj's cross before Makienok scored just his second league goal of the season. Philippe Montanier changed formation at the break and Forest got the goal their improvement deserved when Lam's shot hit the post before bouncing off Maxwell's heel and into the net. Both teams had chances to win it, with Preston defender Alex Baptiste producing a brilliant goal-line clearance to deny Apostolos Vellios in the dying minutes. Nottingham Forest manager Philippe Montanier told BBC Radio Nottingham: "We deserved to lose the first half. The first half was awful, but we had a good reaction and a good game in the second half. "The players showed good determination at the beginning of the second half and after that we were confident." Preston manager Simon Grayson told BBC Radio Lancashire: "If you'd offered us a point before the start of the game, we'd have taken it because you expect Forest to have a reaction from the weekend's result. "But we knew that if we got after them early on we could put them on the back foot and we did that. "Overall I thought we had a very, very good first half. You just want to have that extra goal to go in 2-0 possibly at half-time based on how well we'd played. "Second half, you knew there was going to be a reaction and they changed their system and had a go at us so it's a bit frustrating that we've not won the game, but the way the second half went at times I'm delighted we got another point."

On Tuesday, First Minister Peter Robinson urged the prime minister to suspend the Northern Ireland Assembly. The crisis was sparked by the murder of an ex-IRA man and the Ulster Unionists' subsequent exit from the executive. Arlene Foster said the DUP was prepared to take "our own action" if the government did not intervene. "We will be taking unilateral action next Monday," the finance minister said. "We will give them space the rest of this week to come forward with their own solution, but if nothing happens between now and next week we will be taking our own action." The assembly is due to return from its summer recess next Monday, and Mrs Foster said it would "certainly be very different" after a turbulent month in Northern Ireland politics. After meeting with Secretary of State Theresa Villiers on Wednesday, Sinn Féin's Alex Maskey said the party again made clear its opposition to any assembly suspension. "Martin McGuinness made it very clear to the secretary of state that any suggestion that the  British government should suspend these institutions, Sinn Féin will be very, very hostile to that," he said. "Further to that we will not be in any way cooperating with the concept of self-suspension. "We believe that people out there want all the parties to ensure that these institutions succeed and more importantly that they deliver for the communities." Ulster Unionist leader Mike Nesbitt said it was up to the Northern Ireland parties to sort out the crisis. "I believe we can sort it out if there's political will and we certainly have the will to sort this out, because we don't want to collapse anything, we want to fix everything," he said. In August, police said they believed Provisional IRA members were involved in the murder of Mr McGuigan Sr. Chief Constable George Hamilton said the paramilitary organisation still has structures in place at a senior level but added there was no evidence that hierarchy had sanctioned the killing. That was rejected by Sinn Féin - it said the IRA had left the stage after ordering an end to its armed campaign in 2005. But the UUP leader Mike Nesbitt said Sinn Féin's denial that the IRA existed made it "impossible to do business with them" and has left the executive. Mrs Foster said her party would give the government time and would watch how "the matter will progress over the next few days". "We will see what happens - we're not going to pre-judge what happens from the government, but come Monday it will not be business as usual. "We will not engage in normal politics." Downing Street has said Prime Minister David Cameron recognises the gravity of the situation at Stormont and has asked Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers to hold "urgent" talks with the parties. Mrs Foster said she hoped discussions could begin immediately, and said she believed the talks would take the same format as last December's Stormont House Agreement negotiations. "There is no reason why talks can't take place next week or the following week. "There are two main issues - the full implementation of the Stormont House Agreement and dealing with paramilitary activities." But Alliance MLA Stephen Farry said the odds of any talks proving to be successful were slim. "If these talks do fail I'm afraid the assembly will be bust," he said. "The implications of failure are extremely high."	The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) will take action next week if the government does not provide a solution to the crisis at Stormont, it has said.
In 2013 a working group, set up by the Scottish government, recommended eligible couples should be offered up to three treatments. But that would only be after health boards had reduced IVF waiting times. Infertility Network UK said it was a "no-brainer" there should now be three cycles as waiting times have fallen. New IVF criteria was introduced in July 2013, following recommendations by the National Infertility Working Group. The changes were designed to standardise fertility treatment across Scotland to prevent a "postcode lottery". Giving evidence to Holyrood's health committee, the charity's chief executive Susan Seenan said: "The group recommended three cycles and said that once the waiting times were down to below 12 months, at the latest early 2015, they would consider moving to three cycles. "It just doesn't seem to be happening as fast as we would like it to. "We just think now that the waiting times are down, that it is a no-brainer - we should move to offering everybody who is eligible three cycles." Susan Seenan added: "Everybody in the group was agreed that...three cycles was the best possible way to move forward for patients. "Why anybody would not want to move forward with that, I have no idea, unless it is finance related." A spokeswoman for the Scottish government said Scotland was "leading the way" in the provision of NHS IVF treatment, with Â£12m of investment over the last three years. She said the number of IVF cycles that couples were entitled to was under review. The spokeswoman added: "The reconvened expert group has met twice and its review will consider a range of issues, including the number of IVF cycles, to ensure access to IVF treatments remains fair, reliable and timely. "The views of patients and our stakeholders, including Infertility Network Scotland who are part of the Infertility Group, will be instrumental to this process, along with data collection and modelling." Fertility treatment is currently available to those under 40, and is not offered to women who are obese. In addition, couples need to have been in a stable relationship for two years and neither partner can smoke for three months before treatment begins. Both partners also need to be methadone-free for a year before IVF starts. Women aged between 40 and 42 are eligible for one cycle of fertility treatment if they have never previously undergone the procedure.	A charity is calling for couples in Scotland who need help conceiving to have access to three cycles of IVF instead of two.
The Welsh national field of remembrance at Cardiff Castle features 10,000 wooden crosses remembering the fallen. Each one carries a message to someone who has died while serving their country since World War One. Royal British Legion members and First Minister Carwyn Jones were among those at the service. Mr Jones said he was "proud to be attending this event to honour those who have died in conflict." "As we mark the 100th anniversary of the First World War, there is an even greater opportunity for us to remember those who took part in the War, and the impact of the conflict in shaping modern Wales," he added. At 11:00 GMT there was a two minute silence during which Royal British Legion buglers played the Last Post trumpet call. National Chairman of The Royal British Legion, John Crisford, says the service shows the public's gratitude to those who "made the ultimate sacrifice in defence of our country".	A field of remembrance honouring members of the armed forces from the past 100 years is open at Cardiff Castle.
The 82-year-old, who has had health problems in recent years, reportedly does not wish to remain emperor if he has to reduce his official duties. But a palace spokesman denied that there is any official plan for the monarch to abdicate in what would be an unprecedented move in modern Japan. Crown Prince Naruhito, 56, is next in line to the Chrysanthemum Throne. An unnamed government source told Japan's Kyodo news agency that the emperor, who plays a largely ceremonial role but is respected deeply by many Japanese, has been contemplating the move for about a year. His family had accepted his decision, an unnamed palace source told NHK. However, both palace and government sources say the Imperial Household Law would have to revised to allow for the abdication to take place. A change to the Imperial Household Law, which stipulates the rules of succession, would require approval by Japan's parliament. Despite a categorical denial of the reports by imperial palace spokesman Shinichiro Yamamoto, the emperor's reported wishes are being given prominent attention in the Japanese media. Emperor Akihito has been admired for distancing the monarchy from its association with the aggressive nationalism of World War Two. In 1989 he succeeded his father, Hirohito, who had had the status of a living god in Japan until he was stripped of that role by the victorious Americans who wrote the country's post-war constitution. Emperor Akihito had surgery for prostate cancer in 2003 and a heart bypass operation four years ago. In 2011, he took the highly unusual step of making a televised national address following the devastating earthquake and tsunami at Fukushima. Five things about Japan's emperor:	Japan's Emperor Akihito has expressed his desire to abdicate in the next few years, public broadcaster NHK reports.
Mr McKnight, aged in his 50s, was from Hillsborough, County Down. He was alone in the a two-seater aircraft when it crashed just off the runway at shortly before 11:30 BST. He was taken to the Ulster Hospital in Dundonald where he was pronounced dead.  An air accident investigation is continuing into the cause of the crash. The airfield is operated by the Ulster Flying Club.	The man who died when his light aircraft crash landed at Newtownards airfield, County Down, on Tuesday has been named locally as Stephen McKnight.
The hosts took the lead when Ryan Flynn drove towards the box and curled into the bottom corner.

General Vladimir Padrino tweeted that the "leaders and masterminds of the paramilitary and terrorist assault" had been arrested. The suspects are a 38-year-old former captain, Juan Carlos Caguaripano Scott, and a lieutenant, Jefferson Garcia. Two of the rebels were killed and eight seized after the incident in Valencia. Venezuela has seen four months of violent anti-government protests, and almost 130 people have died in clashes. Just before the barracks attack, a video released on social media showed the uniformed men saying they were rising against the "murderous tyranny of President NicolÃ¡s Maduro". "This is not a coup but a civil and military action to re-establish constitutional order," said the leader, who gave his name as Juan Caguaripano. Venezuelan officials say Mr Caguaripano was discharged from the army in 2014. They claim he commanded around 20 uniformed men during the attack. He then escaped with Lieutenant Garcia and some stolen weaponry, they say. The 6 August incident raised tensions in the divided country, where critics of President Maduro say he is trying to cement a dictatorship. Mr Maduro insists his actions - which include creating a pro-government assembly with the power to rewrite Venezuela's constitution - are the only way to re-establish peace. The US has led a chorus of international alarm against the Maduro government in recent weeks, and has imposed sanctions on several high-ranking Venezuelans - including the president. President Donald Trump said on Friday that he had not ruled out "a possible military option if necessary" against Venezuela. Gen Padrino dismissed the claim as an act of "craziness". He told Venezuela's state television: "It is an act of supreme extremism. There is an extremist elite that rules the United States. "As a soldier, I stand with the Venezuelan armed forces, and with the people. I am sure that we will all be on the front lines of defending the interests and sovereignty of this beloved Venezuela." The White House said Mr Maduro had requested a phone call with his US counterpart on Friday. It said President Trump would speak to Venezuela's leader "as soon as democracy is restored in that country".	Two renegade officers who attacked a Venezuelan army base last weekend have been captured, the country's defence minister has said.
The US Geological Survey said the quake struck at 08:23 GMT, 420km (260 miles) north-west of the capital, Port Vila. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre said the threat of tsunami waves had now mostly passed. The USGS said the quake was fairly shallow - at a depth of about 35km (21 miles) - but no damage had been reported so far. The quake, originally measured at 7.2, struck in the north of Vanuatu off Espiritu Santo. Quakes are fairly common in the region. Two similar sized tremors last October and December caused no damage. Vanuatu has a population of about 270,000, with some 44,000 living in Port Vila.	A 6.9 magnitude earthquake has struck off the Pacific island nation of Vanuatu.
A Calum Dyson double and first-half goal from Chris Clements saw the home side ease to their first win in five League Two games. The Mariners took the lead when a scramble in the penalty area resulted in Tom Bolarinwa's header being cleared off the line, but only to former Stag Clements who bundled the ball home. Sam Jones had a great chance to double the advantage after the break when Mansfield goalkeeper Jake Kean missed Clements' long ball forward, but Rhys Bennett got back just in time to block the midfielder's shot. But Grimsby got their second when Dyson took the ball out on the right before charging his way into the box and finishing superbly beyond Kean. Things went from bad to worse for the visitors when Evans was sent to the stands where he clashed with Blundell Park security staff. Hayden White then saw red after bringing Bolarinwa down in the box, with Dyson converting from the spot to secure the home side's victory.

A 9mm self-loading pistol, ammunition, four Enfield pistols and a rifle component were found at Albert Patterson's house in Hereford, the Hereford Times reported. The 65-year-old was jailed for 15 months at the city's Crown Court. He had already admitted three firearms offences, possessing prohibited ammunition and possessing ammunition without a certificate. More on this story and others from Herefordshire West Mercia Police said Patterson was arrested in January last year and charged in December. Two charges of possessing a prohibited weapon and a second charge of possessing ammunition without a certificate will remain on file following Wednesday's hearing. Former SAS soldier Lofty Wiseman who helped train Patterson, described him as a "good lad" who had been naive. "He broke the law unfortunately. He had to get punished," he said. "If he wanted a weapon as a keepsake, you could have had it de-activated, but by having a weapon, a serviceable weapon and ammunition, I think it's the ammunition that's really been the nail in the coffin. "If you have a weapon in a house with ammunition, there's always that temptation... you can never say you're going to use it but different circumstances, state of mind, if it's there, it can be used so that's where you must have laws."	A former SAS soldier has been jailed for possessing weapons and ammunition.
After weeks of speculation about whether the Governor of the Bank of England would extend his time as its head in reaction to the referendum result, Mark Carney surprised many people in the City and in government by announcing a decision that few had considered. Although many officials at the Bank believed that Mark Carney had two options before him - stay until 2021 or leave as originally intended in 2018 - the governor proffered a third. Extend, yes, but for just one more year. Superficially, it appeared to be a rather awkward fudge. Did Mr Carney feel under political pressure not to extend until 2021 despite wanting to? Was he so disillusioned by the gloomy economic predictions for the UK that he would rather not stick around to see the full effects of the Brexit vote? Or was there another issue weighing on his mind: how his family would feel about another three years in the UK with a father who is regularly away at some global summit or other one weekend in every two? The third, it appears, was the clincher. When Mr Carney took office in 2013, the notion that Britain would be beginning the difficult process of negotiating its way out of the European Union three years later (a process described by the former head of the World Trade Organisation, Pascal Lamy, as something akin to "taking an egg out of omelette"), was a remote one. But that all changed on 23 June. Beyond trying to stabilise the economy, it also created a personal issue for the Governor. If he left in 2018 as originally agreed, it would be right in the middle of Britain's exit negotiations. Should he, therefore, extend his term to the full eight years that governors would usually be expected to serve? That might provide a greater level of certainty for jittery markets. And the Governor certainly understood the challenge of the job had changed, telling those close to him that an extension was an option and he "wanted to serve" - discussions which led to predictions in the media he would serve the full eight years. But, a number of weeks ago in far more private discussions, he started talking about a "third way" - the short extension. The reasons were personal and unique. In 2018, one of Mr Carney's four daughters will be finishing her A-levels, and another will be completing her GCSEs. Like everyone, I have personal circumstances that I have to manage. This is a role that requires total attention and devotion. I intend to give that for as long as I can. For his family, this was the perfect moment to return home to Canada and its much lauded education system. He hinted at how important that was in evidence to the economic affairs committee of the House of Lords last week. "To be absolutely clear, it is an entirely personal decision," he said about whether he would extend his stay. "No one should read anything into that decision as regards government policy - actual, imagined, potential, past. It is an absolute privilege for me to have this role. I fully recognise that. "Like everyone, I have personal circumstances that I have to manage. This is a role that requires total attention and devotion. I intend to give that for as long as I can. Those are the only factors." Those around Mr Carney dismiss any notion of "tension" with the Prime Minister, who was certainly keen for the Governor to extend his period in office to 2021. However, Theresa May was clear that it was up to Mr Carney to make the decision. Neither did criticism from those who believe the Bank's pre-referendum economic forecasts were too gloomy about the effects of a Brexit vote get under his skin, they add. Professionally, Mr Carney was clear that it would difficult to leave in the teeth of the Brexit negotiations. But, with his family leaving in 2018 as originally planned, he only felt able to extend his time in the UK by one year. By then the Article 50 process of decoupling Britain from the EU should be complete. It will then be for a new Governor to plot Britain's economic future.	Sometimes, the simplest explanation is the right one.
Dartmoor Hill Pony Association (DHPA) said it had put forward the idea "reluctantly". The group claims numbers have dropped from about 30,000 at the beginning of the century to just 1,500 in 2011. The DHPA said if numbers continued to fall, the breed could lose its hardiness to survive on the moor. It said demand had dropped for the ponies as pets because of the economic downturn. The ponies were traditionally used for farming, postal deliveries and pulling carts. Charlotte Faulkner, founder of the DHPA, said in a letter to South West Equine Protection (Swep): "It has taken years of considering reports and listening to the outcome of meetings to recognise and reluctantly accept that Dartmoor pony herders will only carry on keeping their herds if they have a sustainable market for them. "We are in real danger of ponies disappearing from Dartmoor altogether." Ms Faulkner said selling ponies for riding and driving would continue. "The Dartmoor Hill Pony Association believes the meat trade should be (used) too," she said. "Strangely, having a meat trade should improve a pony's chances of finding a new home at sale." Becky Treeby, of Swep, said: "Dartmoor hill ponies were there for a reason, for ecology purposes to keep grass on the moors down, and they have been there for thousands of years. People have never eaten them before. It is promoting over-breeding for profit." You can see more on this story on Inside Out SW on BBC One, Monday 29 September, at 19:30 BST. Correction 2 December 2014: This story has been amended to clarify that it refers to Dartmoor Hill ponies rather than Dartmoor ponies.	Dartmoor Hill ponies should be bred for human consumption to ensure their survival on the moor, says a pony group.
Jones, of Colwyn Bay, Conwy, announced last month that he has a severe type of dementia. Fellow Python star Michael Palin paid tribute to his "most wonderful friend" before presenting him with the award. Jones told the crowd to "quieten down" before his son told the crowd it was a "great honour". Accepting the accolade on his father's behalf, a tearful Bill Jones told the audience in Cardiff: "It's a great honour for dad. We're so proud of him... with the struggles we're having at the moment, it's been hard." Earlier in the evening, Hollywood actor Leonardo DiCaprio paid tribute in a video message to Oscar-nominated make-up artist Sian Grigg, who won the Sian Phillips award. It is given to someone who has made a significant contribution to international feature films or network television. Mali Harries took the best actress prize for her performance as Det Insp Mared Rhys in detective series Hinterland/YGwyll, which also won best television drama. Mark Lewis Jones won the best actor award for the film Yr Ymadawiad, which tells story of two young lovers who are saved by a man after crashing their car into a ravine in the remote mountains of Wales. Hinterland/Y Gwyll producer-writer Ed Talfan also won the writer award for the film. Mr Calzaghe, a documentary film about the career of Welsh boxer Joe Calzaghe, won three awards, including special achievement in a feature/television film and best factual director for Vaughan Sivell. Will Millard, won the presenters award for Hunters of the South Seas, which explores the lives of people of the Coral Triangle in the Western Pacific, while Newyddion 9, a BBC Wales production for S4C, won best news coverage for its programme Argyfwng y Mudwyr about the European migrant crisis. Music for Misfits: The Story of Indie, which documents the development of British indie music, won the factual series prize. The award for live outside broadcast went to S4C's Cor Cymru - Y Rownd Derfynol - coverage of the Welsh choir final. Those attending the event, which honours the achievements of Welsh television and film makers, included Gotham star Erin Richards, Torchwood and Victoria actress Eve Miles and comedian Elis James.	Monty Python's Terry Jones has received a standing ovation at the Bafta Cymru awards for his outstanding contribution to television and film.

Tory MP David Davis said news of the proposed in-work benefits ban could encourage workers to head to the UK. Sir Eric Pickles, a Eurosceptic who supports Mr Cameron's reform proposals, said action had to be taken to prevent a "new influx" of migrants. The ban has to be agreed by all EU nations at a summit on 18 February. It will be graduated, so that the longer migrant workers stay in the UK, the more in-work benefits, such as tax credits, they will be entitled to, in order to top-up their wages. EU referendum: PM faces grassroots anger over EU vote Mr Cameron says the move will "make a difference" to high levels of immigration by reducing a "pull factor". But it will have to be agreed by member states, as part of a wider package of reforms to Britain's relationship with the EU, and will only apply for a temporary period as an "emergency brake". If Mr Cameron can get a deal on his reform package in two weeks' time at the Brussels summit he is expected to call a referendum on Britain's membership of the EU in June. David Davis, a former Tory leadership contender and leading Eurosceptic, said eastern European newspapers had carried numerous stories about the plan to terminate in-work benefits for the first four years after a migrant's arrival in the UK. At the same time, he said, Brussels has suggested the scheme could take 12 months to implement. "Under such circumstances the incentive for anybody wishing to come to live in the UK will be to come as quickly as possible to beat the deadline when any such restrictions come into effect," he said. "Accordingly we are likely to see a surge in migrants in the next 12 months." Mr Cameron has suggested the "emergency brake" could come into effect within three months of the UK applying for it. Eric Pickles defended Mr Cameron's reform deal, on the BBC's Sunday Politics, saying: "What we need to be clear is, we're not trying to prevent people moving inside the European Union." The reforms were instead aimed at preventing people gaining "something for nothing" by claiming UK benefits before contributing anything in tax. But Sir Eric. a Conservative former cabinet minister, said action was needed to prevent a surge of migrants: "Clearly as part of the negotiations we have to ensure that that doesn't happen." Meanwhile, speculation is continuing about whether a big cabinet name will lead the campaign to take Britain out of the EU. The Mail on Sunday said Boris Johnson, who has previously said Britain could prosper outside the EU and suggested Mr Cameron's deal needed more work, has told a fellow Tory MP he had "never been an 'outer'". Bernard Jenkin, a leading member of Vote Leave, told the newspaper: "He is genuinely torn but I hope he will change his mind because he is one of the few who understands that if we stay in, Britain will be in a weaker position than ever before." Other potential Tory "outers" include Justice Secretary Michael Gove and Employment Minister Priti Patel, who have said they will make their position clear when they have seen the final deal. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith, who according to the Mail on Sunday has described the deal to friends as a "load of rubbish" which would be challenged in the European courts, is also refusing to comment publicly until the deal is finalised. UKIP MP Douglas Carswell told the BBC's Andrew Marr programme it "would be wonderful" to have a Eurosceptic cabinet minister fronting the exit campaign but it would welcome anyone who wants to join it. He refused to enter into the war of words between the rival groups vying to be designated as the official Leave campaign, but ruled out a merger between them saying they had fundamental differences. He said Leave.EU, which is backed by UKIP donor Arron Banks, wanted to focus on "identity and immigration," while Vote Leave, which he supports, wants to put forward an "optimistic, upbeat internationalist message". A third group, Grassroots Out (GO), which was founded by two Conservative MPs and is backed by UKIP leader Nigel Farage and Mr Banks, has said it is exploring whether it has enough cross-party support to make a bid to be the official Leave campaign. One of its founders, Peter Bone, told the Sunday Politics there were 42 different Eurosceptic groups working together under the cross-party GO "umbrella," and it was possible for them all to to operate as "one happy family".	David Cameron's EU benefit plans could cause a surge in migration before the "emergency brake" is applied, the PM has been warned.
Media playback is not supported on this device Paris Saint-Germain's £50 million defender David Luiz waved across the Parc des Princes pitch and then gestured with a thumbs up. Beaming with a bright smile I waved back immediately, then embarrassment set in. I realised the recognition wasn't for me, it was for another Ballymena man standing just to my left, the head groundsman at PSG. I was immensely proud for Jonathan Calderwood. A man raised just 'up the road' from me in Clough, County Antrim. This is a matchday ritual for Jonathan, receiving accolades from some of the world's most expensive footballers. "When we played Barcelona, I was told that Messi and Neymar both said it was the best pitch they've ever played on, when we played Real Madrid in September I got the same feedback from them," he said. It all started at east Belfast club Glentoran, where Jonathan cut his teeth (and grass) at the Oval. Next stop was the old Wembley Stadium in London, which coincided with his studies at Myrescough College, where he gained a National Diploma in Turf Science. Jonathan worked his way through the ranks, ending up as deputy head groundsman at Wembley. Calderwood went on to become head groundsman at Wolverhampton Wanderers before a move to Aston Villa. During 15 successful years at Villa Park he picked up multiple turf related awards including two Premier League Groundsman of the Year trophies. At Villa he met Gerard Houillier, one of the game's most respected managers. Meanwhile, across the English Channel a group of investors from Qatar made PSG one of Europe's richest football clubs. They wanted the very best of everything, including the blades of grass on the Parc des Princes pitch. On the advice of Houllier that meant a groundsman from Clough. He told PSG that Jonathan was the best groundsman in the world and Carlo Ancelotti, their manager at that time, agreed. Jonathan and his family moved to a new life in Paris and he made an immediate impact, becoming French Groundman of the Year in his first season. He added: "When you hear someone saying 'the guy just cuts grass' it's a little bit hurtful because I know what skills are involved, what dedication, what hours, what knowledge and experience goes into having a pitch like what we have at PSG. "Modern day football pitches are so complex and so complicated. I spent three years full-time at university and I would say 90% of my time was spent in the laboratory doing soil analysis, weeds, pesticides, disease management, wind, water, sunshine, fertiliser programmes and aeration - there is so much to it.' Jonathan's story doesn't end there, for his pitch will host Northern Ireland's game against Germany in Euro 2016. "If you're a groundsman like me, you want to work at the very top and it doesn't come much bigger than the European Championships," he said. "For me to move to Paris and for Northern Ireland to end up playing Germany in Paris on my pitch it doesn't get any better than that - it's like a dream come true." So Jonathan has already had recognition from some of the best players in the world - come 21 June he'll be hoping for a thumbs up from the likes of Steven Davis, Jonny Evans and manager Michael O'Neill. Who knows, that could be after a win over the world champions!	It was just minutes before kick-off, and that's when it happened.
The Victorian Society released its annual list, which it says names those in urgent need of help and protection. It includes Red Barns in Redcar where Bell lived, St Paul's Church in Chester, Wakefield's Clayton Hospital and Mount Street Hospital in Preston. A Grade II flour mill in Grimsby and a Cardiff railway station also feature. For more stories about Victorian England follow our Pinterest board For the first time no properties in London and the South-East have been mentioned. The charity's director, Christopher Costello, said it had "simply got far more nominations from other regions". "Retaining historic buildings like those in the top 10 is vital to maintaining local identity and creating places in which people want to invest, live and work," he said. This Grade II* listed building by arts and crafts architect Philip Webb has been left in a "terrible state" with internal water damage, the society said. It was the childhood home of explorer, writer and archaeologist Gertrude Bell, who travelled around the Middle East in the early 1890s. A Grade II former flour mill, warehouse and office complex which was partially converted to flats in the 1990s. The tower, which was not converted, suffered structural problems earlier this year forcing some people to move out temporarily as their homes were declared unsafe. Thought to have been designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel, the Grade II* station was home to the first steam-powered train service in Wales. A Grade II building that was partially funded by philanthropist Andrew Carnegie and once housed Clement Lindley Wragge's collection of ethnographic, zoological and geological material. Built as an orphanage, this Grade II Victorian Gothic building later became a convalescent home but has been empty for more than a decade. The stone Tudor-style hospital is threatened under a planning application by a foundation to demolish it for expansion purposes, the charity said. The society said the Grade II* church was "going through a closure process after the congregation merged with another church". A Grade II complex of Gothic sandstone buildings which was first a seminary and then a boarding school whose alumni are said to include comedians Tom O'Connor and Johnny Vegas. A Grade II listed former cotton mill, with boiler, engine house, chimney and weaving sheds which has been left derelict since the early 2000s and is currently for sale at Â£2.5m. This Grade II Shapland and Petter brick factory, showroom and office complex on the riverside was designed by William Clement Oliver.	The former home of explorer Gertrude Bell, a Grade II* listed church and two derelict hospitals are among 10 of the most endangered historic buildings.
Media playback is not supported on this device The Scot, 28, beat world number 87 Taro Daniel 6-1 6-3 6-1 in his first match since becoming a father last month. World number six Kei Nishikori brought the visitors level with a 6-3 7-5 7-6 (7-3) win over Dan Evans in Birmingham. Victory in the best-of-five first-round tie will secure a quarter-final place and World Group status in 2017. Dom Inglot and Jamie Murray are scheduled to take on Yoshihito Nishioka and Yasutaka Uchiyama in Saturday's doubles contest, although the line-ups can change up to an hour before the 14:00 GMT start time. "We will wait and see," GB captain Leon Smith told BBC Sport. "[It will be] hopefully our strongest team, put it that way." Britain are defending the title they regained last November for the first time in 79 years with victory against Belgium. "It was amazing," Murray said of the reception he received after needing only 90 minutes to see off Daniel. Media playback is not supported on this device There were signs of rustiness - four double faults and 25 unforced errors slowing his progress at times - but the Scot broke serve six times and saved both break points he faced in a one-sided win. Murray, 28, won the opening 11 points in his first match since losing to Novak Djokovic in the Australian Open final 33 days ago. He wrapped up the first set in 28 minutes and took hold of a more competitive second after a double fault at 3-3 from Daniel, the US-born 23-year-old with just five ATP wins to his name. Two blistering returns gave Murray the decisive break at the start of the third and he wrapped up the 28th Davis Cup singles win of his career in style. "The last few weeks have been the best of my life, really special," Murray said of becoming a father to Sophia. "It has been tough the last few days being away from her for the first time but it had to happen to some stage, and it is a pleasure to represent my country and be with team-mates that we won with last year. "The second set was tough - a lot of close games and some tough points, which was good for me. "I was getting a little out of breath but I played a good match, served well, missed a few second serves but the first serve went extremely well, so it was a nice start." Evans, from Solihull, had the support of his home crowd and the confidence from a victory in his only previous meeting with Nishikori, but the Japanese player was still too strong. It is over three years since he surprisingly lost to Evans at the US Open and Nishikori has since become established among the game's elite. Evans, 25, once again played above his ranking of 157 but could only convert four of 13 break points that came his way. After dropping serve twice in the first set he failed to capitalise on 0-40 early on in what proved to be a tight second. Both players missed break point chances and a tie-break loomed with the Briton serving at 6-5, but after saving two set points he then netted a volley and double faulted. With both men apparently tiring, the third set saw a rash of service breaks - six in eight games - with Evans unable to build on leads at 3-2 and 4-3. Nishikori, 26, was similarly vulnerable on his own serve but got himself across the line in the tie-break after two hours and 44 minutes. Andy Murray slipped fairly seamlessly back into the day job, but Kei Nishikori had to absorb a lot of pressure from Dan Evans to make sure the tie is level heading into Saturday's doubles. But who will play? Murray told me he "would love to play if it's the best thing for the team," as long as his body feels fine in the morning. But will Nishikori be on the other side of the court? It is looking likely - even though he has only ever played two Davis Cup doubles matches for Japan. "He missed a few balls and looked a bit rusty but overall you've got to give Andy a 9/10.

Sightings of creepy clowns have sparked minor hysteria across the US since August. People in clown masks have reportedly chased others and tried to lure children into woods. Victoria police warned that such escapades would "not be tolerated". Creepy clown sightings leave US baffled 'Killer clowns' come to Canada Lurking clown arrested in Kentucky woods In a statement on its Facebook page, which appears to have since been deleted, the force wrote: "Victoria Police are aware of people who are parading in public wearing clown masks. "The clown purge appears to be a copycat of incidents being seen in the USA recently. "Any intimidating and threatening as well as anti-social behaviours will not be tolerated and will be investigated by Police." Clowns have also been spotted in Sydney, with one pictured loitering outside a fast food restaurant in the Campbelltown area. Australians have responded by setting up Facebook pages dedicated to "clown hunting", as the sightings spread. One theory has it that the upswing in "killer clown" antics is linked to the release of novelist Stephen King's new film, It. The plot involves a child-slaughtering being which takes the form of a clown called Pennywise to lure its prey. But King has criticised the craze. This week, he tweeted: "Hey, guys, time to cool the clown hysteria - most of em are good, cheer up the kiddies, make people laugh." The sinister craze began in South Carolina with reports that men dressed as clowns were trying to coax children into the woods with money. It was followed by sightings in Alabama, Georgia and Pennsylvania. Schools in Texas and Alabama have even shut down over the phenomenon. On Tuesday, White House press secretary Josh Earnest told a press briefing that President Barack Obama had not been briefed on the issue, but added, "this is a situation that local law enforcement authorities take quite seriously". Reports suggest New Zealand has also been sucked into the epidemic, after a clown "lurking" at a school spooked parents on Wednesday. Some professional clowns fear the negative trend may put them in physical danger. Professional clown Jordan Jones, who goes by the name Snuggles, has started a #ClownLivesMatter movement, inspired by the #BlackLivesMatter campaign, to remind the public that real clowns want to spread happiness, not fear.	Australian police in Victoria have warned the public not to engage in "intimidating" behaviour after reports of clowns terrorising people in Melbourne.
Patrick Ewing, 66, collapsed at his home in Oakham, Rutland, and was given resuscitation by his partner, Yvonne Ainsworth. Paramedics used a defibrillator to shock Mr Ewing to restore his normal heart rhythm for almost an hour. East Midlands Ambulance Service (EMAS) said only about 8% of patients survived a cardiac arrest outside hospital. Andy Swinburn, of EMAS, said: "Patrick's case is extremely rare. His heart muscle was very unstable, which lead to a repeated cardiac arrest meaning the crew had to shock him 17 times." Mr Ewing said: "It's an astonishing thing to tip over the edge and be hauled back again. "What they did for me might of just been part of their day job but they worked so hard to keep me going. I will forever be grateful."	Ambulance crews who gave a cardiac arrest patient 17 high-energy electric shocks say he is lucky to be alive.
"Bonkers Bruno Locked Up", was changed to "Sad Bruno in Mental Home" by the time later editions rolled off the presses. The revised words were still criticised by mental health charities. Eleven years on, after high-profile cases including Stan Collymore,Marcus Trescothick,Neil Lennon and Robert Enke, has the reporting of mental health issues in sport improved? A panel including cricketer Michael Yardy, whose depression became public knowledge after he left England's 2011 World Cup campaign, and the Professional Footballers' Association head of welfare Michael Bennett met at MediaCity UK in Salford to discuss how they would change reporting of mental health in sport. It may be tempting to look for indications of a sportsperson's mental health while they are under the spotlight in competition. But it is often when people are free to reflect, rather than when they are consumed by the action, that problems can arise. "After I left the World Cup, Geoffrey Boycott took my depression to be a reflection of my performances," explained Yardy. "But it is not always about performance. "There are times that I have performed brilliantly, driven home, gone to bed and not been right in myself. "I think I had my worst bouts of depression during the winter months when I have been away from cricket. "Sometimes it is actually nice to have the ball and bat in your hand and it is just you in that moment. "Conversely fielding can actually be quite difficult because if you have bowled a bad last over or something you can 'catastrophe' things." "There is an assumption in the media sometimes that something on the field of play has triggered these issues and it is not always the case," added Daily Telegraph columnist Jim White. A survey by mental health charity Mind earlier this year showed that 60% of people were encouraged to seek help for their own mental illness after learning about a sportsperson with similar problems. Coverage of a sportsperson's problems will have an effect on those consuming it just as it does on the star at the centre. "The way that these are issues are dealt with around big heroes in the sports pages is read, watched and listened to be people who suffer from depression themselves," said White. "If the analysis is that a sportsperson should have nothing to worry about, then you start to question the validity of your own problems. "The way we deal with it is not just to be sensitive to the suffer themselves, but the way it is presented to everyone else." When England batsman Jonathan Trott left the Ashes tour of Australia in November with what the ECB described as, a "long-standing stress-related condition", the end of Marcus Trescothick's international career came to mind. Wracked with depression, Trescothick dissolved into tears at Heathrow's duty-free in 2006, as he prepared to board a flight to Australia with his team-mates. But Trott later revealed that he was "emotionally and mentally spent" rather than depressed when he flew home. Former England captain Michael Vaughan said that he felt conned by the impression that Trescothick and Trott's cases were similar. "A lot of players come to talk to me about things and I'm happy to speak to them but I have my own issues and everyone is very different," said Yardy. "It is very dangerous to say that one case of depression is the same as another." "It is now very clear that Jonathan Trott was not in the same boat as Marcus Trescothick," Sky News Sports editor Nick Powell added. Stories about mental health issues tend to focus on the trauma suffered, rather than the triumph over the odds. "We never talk about positive mental health, it is always seen negatively," said Bennett. "We need to change that around so it is seen as a positive that someone is confident enough to come forward and share their issues." "People who have suffered with mental health are actually very strong in that they have kept it inside so long and continued on in spite of it," added Yardy. It is the white noise to which the serious business of the dressing room is played out to - joking and joshing, mockery and mirth. But does banter have to stop when it comes to mental illness? "In a strange way I embrace it, because the worse thing can be that people feel they can't have a joke with you," said Yardy. "People do take the mickey out of me, but in a closed environment and they know the boundaries. You obviously have to know somebody very well."	The Sun's original headline, above the 2003 story of former heavyweight champion Frank Bruno's admission to a psychiatric hospital, did not last long.
United Nations officials rarely use the words "genocide" and "ethnic cleansing," but they now say potentially both could envelop the world's youngest country. Since violence flared in Juba in July and spread to the previously peaceful southern Equatoria states of South Sudan, 340,000 people have fled the violence into neighbouring Uganda. That is more than any other country this year - the UN says 200,000 people have fled Syria in 2016. Every day, on average, another 2,500 South Sudanese become refugees, and the stories of what they escaped and what they saw on the way, add to the evidence of killing, rape and the targeting of civilians along ethnic lines. Nelson Ladu Thomas has twice walked over the small wooden bridge dividing South Sudan and Uganda at an unofficial border crossing known as Busia. A trickle of a stream divides these two countries and there are small bridges or fallen trees every couple of kilometres. The first time he crossed was with his immediate family; the second - a day later - was with his brother's wife and her five children who he had gone back to help. Six-year-old Moriswani was limping up the hill to the Ugandan police post where their possessions were inspected before being allowed on to a reception centre a little further up the road. I asked him what they had left behind. "They are killing people, sleeping with wives, stealing. They are not shooting you, they are cutting you with a knife. Even small children can be beaten down," Mr Thomas told me. The children gulped water and sat exhausted in the shade of a harsh sun. "They don't want us," he said, and gave his explanation of why his town of Yei, just 80km (50 miles) from the border, had become a place he had to leave. "These tribes of Dinka, they don't want Equatorians, they don't want… Nuer. They don't want them." Ethnic violence has dominated the crisis in South Sudan. The civil war began as a dispute between the Dinka President Salva Kiir, and former Vice-President Riek Machar who is Nuer. Equatorians only started to be targeted in July, when the violence spread to their part of the country after rebel troops fled the capital. In a long line of people at a nearby refugee reception centre, Otima Amos, 21, explained how he had crossed the border after walking through the bush for many days with 16 other people - most children, and among them two-year-old twins."We walked up to here - without any other form of transport," he said. "It was very hard because they were killing people. If you were a boy you would be killed, if you were a girl or a woman they would just rape you. If not, you would be killed." They were afraid they would be caught as they tried to escape. Uganda is coping extremely well with the huge influx of refugees. With the help of aid agencies, within 36 hours each family is allocated a 30m square patch of land and a tarpaulin to set up a shelter and start planting crops. Faida Sarah arrived in August with her children, but already has okra ready to harvest as well as onions, tomatoes and greens bursting out of the ground. The reason she left Yei was because one night soldiers came round to her home, demanded car keys from her husband and then hacked him to death just outside the house. In July Bidi Bidi was a village, but now it is one of the biggest refugee settlements in the world - home to more than a quarter of a million people and covering 250 square kilometres. But now home to nearly a million refugees, Uganda is beginning to struggle with its generous approach. "This has been unrelenting since July," said Nasir Abel Fernandes, the UNHCR's senior emergency coordinator in northern Uganda. "The international community has to pay attention, and pressure the South Sudanese leaders to stop this, as it's a massacre of civilians from both sides." He says supplying water to the refugees is a problem, as it has to be trucked in. As many as half the refugees are children, and schools are already running - exams were being marked and a presentation prepared for our visit. Girls sang and danced in a circle then Patricia Mercy, 16, stepped forward with confidence to deliver her poem. "War, war, war," she began, "who are you and where do you come from?" The confidence and resilience of her performance hiding deep trauma. "You have killed my mother and father, even my brothers and sisters, leaving me to be called an orphan."

One of the uprising's leaders said the soldiers were "ready to fight" if attacked. Sergeant Seydou Koné said they did not want to negotiate with anyone, according to Reuters news agency. The unrest began after a spokesman for the soldiers announced on Thursday that they had dropped their pay demands. In January, they forced the government into paying them about $8,000 (£6,200) each in bonuses to end a rebellion. They were due to receive a further payment this month and about 8,000 mutineers are unhappy that they were not consulted ahead of Thursday's televised announcement. Three former rebels from the country's civil war era were wounded on Saturday after the mutinous soldiers opened fire in Bouaké to stop them staging their own protest, Sergeant Koné said. There have also been reports of injuries after shooting in the northern city of Korhogo. The military chief of staff, General Sékou Touré, had threatened "severe disciplinary sanctions" on Friday if the uprising did not end. Shops are closed and soldiers are patrolling and firing in the air in Bouaké, residents said. The mutineers have also taken control of the city of Odienne, in the north, reports say. On Friday, shots were fired in the air at military bases in Abidjan, Bondoukou in the east, Bouaké in the centre, and Korhogo. It is believed the mutineers were firing blanks. In response, elite Republican Guard troops in Abidjan fired warning shots that pushed the mutineers back inside the military headquarters compound in Abidjan, Reuters reported. The situation in the city on Saturday was said to be calm. Reacting to the spreading unrest, President Alassane Ouattara held an emergency meeting of the country's security council. The mutiny has raised fears of a resurgence of the violence seen during Ivory Coast's 10-year civil war, which ended in 2011. Many of the mutineers in January were thought to be former rebels who joined the army after the conflict.	Angry soldiers have blocked off access to Bouaké, the second largest city in the Ivory Coast, as a revolt over a pay dispute continues.
John Stollery, 58, a social worker from Nottinghamshire, was one of 30 UK holidaymakers killed by a gunman near Sousse last year. His wife Cheryl said her husband was the most "fantastic man" and his legacy could bring about "peace" and "understanding". The terror attack on June 26 claimed the lives of 38 people. The attack in the resort of Port El Kantaoui was claimed by the so-called Islamic State. Mr Stollery worked at Nottinghamshire County Council for 33 years and for the last 16 years was a social worker, working with children in care. Mrs Stollery said she had been focussing on what good could come following her husband's death. She said: "Hopefully [the] legacy of John's of making somebody else's life brighter and fulfilling their dreams, might bring about some better understanding and hopefully some peace. "Acts of violence are not the answer. "He was the most fantastic man I could have met. He made a difference in so many ways to myself, Matthew our son, to the people that he worked with." Neil Duckmanton, Mr Stollery's best friend, said: "If there was anything he could do for anybody, he would, and he did that with me for 30 years." He will be remembered at a service at St Edmund's Church in Walesby, Nottinghamshire.	A victim of the Tunisia beach massacre is to be remembered in a church service one year on from the attack.
The 35-year-old joined the Iron from Blackpool in 2013 and has made 119 league appearances for the League One side. He helped them to a third-placed finish this season, before they were beaten by Millwall in the play-off semi-finals. Bishop told the club website: "With the way the season finished, it's a sense of unfinished business and it was disappointing for all of us."	Scunthorpe midfielder Neal Bishop has signed a one-year contract extension.
The High Court granted the adjournment after hearing a share purchase agreement was due to be completed, which meant HMRC would receive £1.4m. HMRC had applied to put the Formula 1 team, based in Enstone, Oxfordshire, in administration over unpaid tax. On Thursday, Renault confirmed it would take over Lotus. The adjournment was granted by Mr Justice Birss until 21 December, with the completion of the purchase agreement due on 16 December. He approved Lotus' application for the adjournment, which was backed by Renault Sport and not resisted, because the proposed deal was the result most likely to be of benefit to the creditors and the best chance of rescuing the business as a going concern. Other creditors, owed in excess of £2m, would be paid by 31 December, counsel Jeremy Bamford told the court. Renault first announced its intention to take over the cash-strapped team in September. HMRC brought the case against Lotus because of unpaid income tax and National Insurance contributions.	Lotus has been given a further two-week breathing space in insolvency proceedings brought by Revenue and Customs (HMRC).
Three fire engines were called to Railway Street, Tunstall, at about 2320 GMT on Tuesday. Crews brought the fire in the lounge under control within half an hour. The cause was believed to be accidental. The two people, who were suffering from smoke inhalation, were rescued from a first floor window. They were later discharged from hospital.	A man and a woman have been taken to hospital after being rescued from a house fire in Stoke-on-Trent.
2 December 2016 Last updated at 18:32 GMT We look back at the 22-year rule of the controversial and outspoken leader.	Gambia's Yahya Jammeh, who once said he would rule the country for "one billion years", has lost the presidential election to property magnate Adama Barrow.
Brian Buckle of Fishguard was convicted of child sex abuse in the 1990s, when his victim was aged between eight and 10-years-old. Swansea Crown Court sentenced him to a combined 33 years in prison, to be served over a 15 year period. He was found guilty of 16 counts of non-recent sexual abuse against a child. Dyfed-Powys Police Det Insp Richard Yelland said the sentence recognised "long-lasting harm" to the victim. He added: "This is the second case for the force, in recent weeks, where a significant custodial sentence has been passed down to a perpetrator of non-recent sexual offending."	A 45-year-old man from Pembrokeshire has been been jailed for historical sex offences against a child.
In experiments on mice, the stem cells were genetically engineered to produce and secrete toxins which kill brain tumours, without killing normal cells or themselves. Researchers said the next stage was to test the procedure in humans. A stem cell expert said this was "the future" of cancer treatment. The study, published in the journal Stem Cells, was the work of scientists from Massachusetts General Hospital and the Harvard Stem Cell Institute. For many years, they had been researching a stem-cell-based therapy for cancer, which would kill only tumour cells and no others. They used genetic engineering to make stem cells that spewed out cancer-killing toxins, but, crucially, were also able to resist the effects of the poison they were producing. They also posed no risk to normal, healthy cells. In animal tests, the stem cells were surrounded in gel and placed at the site of the brain tumour after it had been removed. Their cancer cells then died as they had no defence against the toxins. Dr Khalid Shah, lead author and director of the molecular neurotherapy and imaging lab at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, said the results were very positive. "After doing all of the molecular analysis and imaging to track the inhibition of protein synthesis within brain tumours, we do see the toxins kill the cancer cells." He added: "Cancer-killing toxins have been used with great success in a variety of blood cancers, but they don't work as well in solid tumours because the cancers aren't as accessible and the toxins have a short half-life." But genetically engineering stem cells has changed all that, he said. "Now, we have toxin-resistant stem cells that can make and release cancer-killing drugs." Chris Mason, professor of regenerative medicine at University College London, said: "This is a clever study, which signals the beginning of the next wave of therapies. "It shows you can attack solid tumours by putting mini pharmacies inside the patient which deliver the toxic payload direct to the tumour. "Cells can do so much. This is the way the future is going to be." Nell Barrie, senior science information manager for Cancer Research UK, said it was an "ingenious approach". "We urgently need better treatments for brain tumours and this could help direct treatment to exactly where it's needed. "But so far the technique has only been tested in mice and on cancer cells in the lab, so much more work will need to be done before we'll know if it could help patients with brain tumours." She said this type of research could help boost survival rates and bring much-needed progress for brain cancers. Dr Shah now plans to test the technique using a number of different therapies on mice with glioblastoma, the most common brain tumour in human adults. He hopes the therapies could be used in clinical trials within the next five years.	Scientists from Harvard Medical School have discovered a way of turning stem cells into killing machines to fight brain cancer.
The Accounts Commission said there was a risk services could not be maintained without improvements in the way the council was run. But the report recognised that the council delivered good services at the moment. The authority needs to save Â£22.3m - 10% of its budget - by 2017/18. On top of that, council reserves are low and are projected to fall further, the report said. The Accounts Commission is the public spending watchdog for local government in Scotland. In its report, the commission said the council urgently needed "clearer priorities" in its transformation programme to ensure key projects were completed and savings made. The report recognised the council's "commitment to improvement", but added that it was concerned about the pace of those improvements. Deficiencies highlighted by the commission included financial control and management of resources. The chairman of the commission, Douglas Sinclair, said: "There is a gap between the council's ambition and seeing evidence of that on the ground. This is what East Dunbartonshire needs to address if it is to continue to deliver good quality services in the future."	A public spending watchdog has published "serious concerns" over the financial control of East Dunbartonshire Council.
The school's headmaster said the "growing expense and luxury" forced on parents was also a major concern. Beaulieu Convent School in Jersey also referred to "worries about alcohol and drug consumption" at the end of Year 11 event for pupils aged 15-16. A former pupil said the prom was an important milestone and accused the school of overreacting. Chris Beirne, headmaster, said the "significant focus and distraction" caused by the prom "does not fit into the ethos of our school". Writing to parents Mr Beirne cited a letter from an unnamed colleague who was convinced the preparations and the event were "not positive, constructive or healthy experiences". The colleague wrote: "The financial strain and the inevitable competition associated with this is another very unwelcome, and sometimes crushing, aspect for many parents." The letter from the colleague also referred to "alcohol and drug consumption at after-parties" as "a considerable concern". It said the strain of trying "to be slim, fashionable, have perfect skin" led to "unacceptable pressure". Mr Beirne said he could no longer "safely manage the risk" associated with the event. The independent Catholic school said it would continue to offer Year 13 leavers a celebratory mass with their families followed by a drinks reception at the school. The Â£5,400-a-year convent has around 760 students aged 4-18. Former pupil Hannah Hosegood, 20, said her prom was "a first taste of maturity" and the school should tackle individual pupils if they had concerns about drugs or alcohol. She said: "It's really upsetting knowing those girls won't be able to experience an event you spend a fair amount of time looking forward to and remember for the rest of your life."	A girls' school has scrapped its end of year prom claiming it is too much of a "distraction" to pupils.
Tomasz Galwaz, 29, died after falling from the roof of Al Amin Wholesale in Aston, Birmingham on 5 January 2015. Mafizur Rahman, 32, of Trinity Road, Aston, pleaded guilty to manslaughter at Birmingham Crown Court in December. Police said his main priority had been to get roof repairs done as cheaply as possible with disregard to the safety of workers. Al Amin Wholesale Limited, the company who own the buildings, also pleaded guilty to two breaches under the Health and Safety at Work Act. The firm was also fined Â£144,000 and ordered to pay costs of Â£44,600. See more stories from across Birmingham and the Black Country here Mr Galwaz and a friend were employed by Rahman in December 2014 to carry out repairs to the roof of the warehouse in Grosvenor Road, owned by his brothers and father, police said. The deal was carried out through an interpreter as the two Polish men spoke little English. Police were later told by the interpreter that there were no discussions around safety procedures, personal protective equipment or risk assessments. There was also no mention of insurance. The men were working on the roof on 5 January when it cracked and they both fell through on to a concrete floor. Mr Galwaz was taken to hospital with a serious head wound and died from his injuries the following day. The second man suffered minor injuries. Det Insp Jim Munro, from West Midlands Police, said: "Rahman's main priority was to get the job done as cheaply as possible with complete disregard for the safety of these workers âˆ’ with tragic consequences." A second man also arrested in January 2015 on suspicion of manslaughter was released without charge.	A businessman has been jailed for 30 months after a man plunged to his death from a warehouse roof.
Steven Souley, 26, and his accomplice Zico Malavin, 20, were remanded in custody after they admitted attacking Robert Eadie, 25, in Glasgow in 2014. The victim required surgery to repair a wound to his groin and penis after being hit with an axe and knife. Souley was previously jailed for seven years for killing a man in 2010. Sentence on both accused was deferred at the High Court in Glasgow after they admitted assaulting Mr Eadie to his severe injury and permanent disfigurement. The court heard that the attack happened at a Christmas party hosted by Mr Eadie's sister at her flat in the city's Summerston area. Souley and Malavin, who were not invited, turned up at about midnight. Souley was armed with an axe and Malavin - who was wearing a red Christmas jumper - was clutching a knife. Mr Eadie's sister, who knew the pair, demanded that they leave. Her brother was attacked after he tried to put them out of the flat. Souley and Malavin both fled the scene and police and paramedics were called. A knife and a Christmas sweater were later found at a property linked to Souley. It was months later that the pair were charged. The court heard that Mr Eadie needed an operation to repair a "deep wound" to his groin and to his penis. He also suffered injuries to his head and hand. He was released from hospital days later, but will be permanently scarred. Souley and Malavin, both from the city's Drumchapel area, will be sentenced next month. Souley was jailed in 2011 after being convicted of the culpable homicide of 41-year-old Andrew Curran. In May 2014 he was deemed safe enough to be freed early. Zico Malavin's brothers were both found guilty of murder over the attack on Mr Curran. Angus Malavin was jailed for 18 years and younger brother Zak for 17 years. Mr Curran died from a sword wound to the neck. The fatal park attack happened following a row over a bottle of Buckfast. A fourth Malavin brother, Kris, was jailed for seven years in 2014 after he tried to run down and kill a key witness in the murder trial.	A convicted killer has been sent back to jail after he admitted carrying out a brutal attack on Christmas Day, months after being freed early.
London's first Lumiere festival will feature illuminations and animations projected at 20 locations in the West End and Kings Cross over four nights. Julian Opie will be among more than two dozen artists taking part. The Durham version has been running since 2009 and attracted 175,000 people in 2013. Almost 180,000 turned out when producers Artichoke staged a Lumiere in Londonderry when it was UK City of Culture the same year. The London event will take place from 14-17 January. Mayor Boris Johnson said it would be "a dazzling new festival for the capital" that would "expel the post-Christmas blues". The first artists to be confirmed for London are: Artichoke director Helen Marriage said: "Lumiere was born in Durham and its incredible success has been recognised across the world. Lumiere London will be a very different event with its own artistic programme, but the principles remain the same." This year's Lumiere will take place in Durham from 12-15 November.	A major festival of light art is to be staged in London next year by the people who organise the biennial Lumiere festival in Durham.
The country has now seen two consecutive quarters of declining growth, the usual definition of recession. Its vital oil industry has been hit by weaker global prices, according to the Nigerian Bureau of Statistics (NBS). But the government says there has been strong growth in other sectors. Crude oil sales account for 70% of government income. The price of oil has fallen from highs of about $112 a barrel in 2014 to below $50 at the moment. Outside the oil industry, the figures show the fall in the Nigerian currency, the naira, has hurt the economy. It was allowed to float freely in June to help kick-start the economy, but critics argued it should have been done earlier. The government, however, has found some positive news in the figures. "There was growth in the agricultural and solid minerals sectors... the areas in which the federal government has placed particular priority," said presidential economic adviser Adeyemi Dipeolu. Nigeria, which vies with South Africa for the mantle of Africa's biggest economy, is also battling an inflation rate at an 11-year high of 17.1% in July. "A lot of Nigeria's current predicament could have been avoided," said Kevin Daly from Aberdeen Asset Management. "The country is so reliant on oil precisely because its leaders haven't diversified the economy. "More recently, they have tried, and failed, to prop up the naira, which has had a ruinous effect on the country's foreign exchange reserves and any reputation it might have had of being fiscally responsible." This economic recession comes as no surprise to millions of Nigerians. Many say they've never known it so tough. The slump in global oil prices has hit Nigeria hard. The government depends on oil sales for about 70% of its revenues. But critics say government policies made a bad situation even worse. The decision to delay devaluing Nigeria's currency meant many businesses struggled to get foreign currency to pay for imports, which had a cooling effect on the entire economy. Following enormous pressure, the government changed tack this summer, allowing the naira to float. That's led to a spike in inflation, but the hope is that it will attract foreign investors. The government also says the country needs to import less: it wants to see more products made in Nigeria.	Nigeria has slipped into recession, with the latest growth figures showing the economy contracted 2.06% between April and June.
The sign - on the Beeston-bound platform of the Queen's Medical Centre stop - points commuters towards the "Univeristy Of Nottingham". The error could have been there for "seven to eight months", it is estimated. A Nottingham Express Transport (NET) spokesman said they will now be looking to replace the sign next week. People were quick to condemn the "unfortunate error", captured by a BBC journalist. It follows another spelling mishap spotted on a sign last July on the network, which stated "Chillwell Road" rather than Chilwell Road. "Absolute joke - what is happening with the world," Melanie Winskill wrote on BBC Radio Nottingham's Facebook page. Gill Bennett pondered: "Maybe the people responsible didn't go to university." A NET spokesman said it is unsure how long the error has existed at the stop, but added it "could have been there for seven to eight months". "Clearly this is an unfortunate error made during the production of the sign," the spokesman said. "We will be looking to replace it as soon as possible next week now it has been pointed out."	A misspelt sign at a stop on Nottingham's tram network has been branded an "absolute joke".
Aberdeenshire-based Harbro Group saw pre-tax profit increase by £800,000, to £3.5m, in the year to the end of June 2016. This was despite turnover falling by £1m to just over £100m. Harbro said international sales grew over the year, both in Europe and in new markets further afield. The Turriff-based company manufactures and supplies feeds for the beef, sheep, dairy, pig and poultry sectors. It also has a network of 19 shops across Scotland, operating under the Country Store brand. The stores cater for farming and rural communities with a range of products, including fireside supplies, country clothing and footwear. In accounts filed with Companies House, the company said: "As always, the outlook for agriculture is difficult to predict. "We have certainly been experiencing challenging times over the last 12-18 months but the industry is a robust one. "The impact of Brexit is still to be fully understood, although the board are confident that the group will be well positioned for whatever business challenges this may bring about."	One of Scotland's largest animal feed producers has posted a rise in profits, despite reporting a "challenging" year for the industry.
Elections are being held in 27 English county councils and seven unitary authorities, last contested in 2009, as well as in Anglesey in Wales. Labour are defending the South Shields seat in a contest caused by the resignation of David Miliband in March. Mayoral contests are also being held in Doncaster and North Tyneside. Polls for all the contests opened at 07:00 BST, and close at 22:00 BST. Blue sky and sunshine are covering much of England, as millions of voters choose who will represent them on their local council. More than 2,300 seats are up for grabs in county councils and unitary authorities across the length and breadth of England, including Derbyshire, Lancashire, Somerset, Essex, Surrey, Leicestershire, Kent, Durham, Bristol and Cornwall. The Conservatives and Labour are putting up candidates in most seats, with 2,263 and 2,168 candidates respectively. The Lib Dems have 1,763 candidates. UKIP is fielding 1,745 candidates, three times as many as it did the last time these seats were fought in 2009, and the Greens have 893 candidates. Other parties standing include the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition, which is fighting 120 seats, the BNP, with 99 candidates and the English Democrats, with 38 candidates. There are around 900 independent candidates. No elections are taking place in London, Scotland or Northern Ireland. The majority of council results are expected on Friday between 11:00 BST and 18:30 BST, although six councils - Lincolnshire, Dorset, Somerset, Essex, Gloucestershire and Hampshire - will declare their results in the early hours of Friday morning. The result for the South Shields by-election is also expected early on Friday morning.	Voters across England are going to the polls for council elections and a parliamentary by-election in South Shields.

PM Viktor Orban said Hungary would not allow migrants to leave its territory without registering. His comments came as Hungarian authorities opened the main rail station in Budapest to hundreds of migrants after a two-day stand-off. One train left, but then stopped near a migrant reception centre. Migrants mostly from Syria but also from Iraq, Pakistan and Afghanistan resisted efforts by police to get them off the train at Bicske, about 40km (25 miles) west of Budapest. Some were banging on the windows and shouting "Germany, Germany." Follow our live updates EU rules place responsibility for assessing asylum claims on the country where a migrant first arrives. Many of the migrants currently in Hungary have been refusing to register there, in order to continue their journeys to Germany before seeking asylum. Nothing illustrates how difficult this crisis is to resolve than what has happened to these several hundred refugees who are currently on this train at Bicske. They jumped on the train after waiting at Budapest station for three hours. They were really tightly crammed in - women and babies. They were told no international trains would leave. but eventually they were told this train would leave and they believed and hoped it would take them close enough to the Austrian border to get across. There were some police on board. We got as far as Bickse and when the train pulled in, there were loads of police waiting for them on the platform. The plan seemed to be to remove them, to take them to a centre where they would be properly identified. Some people left the first carriage, but almost immediately there was resistance, a lot of people were banging on the windows, some were shouting "Germany! Germany!" The police put on riot gear. And then there was one really distressing scene involving a woman who was carrying a baby by the railway tracks shouting "help! help!" There was a struggle involving one of her companions and riot police. This incensed some of the other refugees who had been taken off the train, they began pushing and jostling and there was a little bit of fighting with the riot police. And then they forced their way back on the train, which is where we are at the moment with police on the platform with several hundred refugees on the train in sweltering conditions. International services from Budapest's Keleti station were suspended indefinitely. There have been days of tension at the station. The number of migrants entering Europe has reached record levels this year. Germany expects to take in 800,000 asylum seekers this year - four times last year's total. The surge in numbers has created tension and disagreement over EU migration policy. Germany has been prepared to accept large numbers of asylum seekers, but other countries have not. Mr Orban, who heads the anti-immigration Fidesz party and was in Brussels for talks, said Hungarians and other Europeans were "full of fear" because "they see that the European leaders, among them the prime ministers, are not able to control the situation". During a tense press conference with European Parliament President Martin Schulz, the Hungarian leader said that "nobody would like to stay in Hungary, neither in Slovakia nor Poland nor Estonia. "All of them would like to go to Germany," he said. "Our job is only to register them." Mr Schulz countered: "What we are seeing for the time being is egoism instead of common European sense. "To say 'yeah, you know we have refugees all over in Europe but they all want to go to Germany and therefore we are not concerned' is effective, but wrong. And therefore I think we need a fair and just distribution." European Council president Donald Tusk said on Thursday that EU countries should accept at least 100,000 asylum seekers between them, a sharp increase on a previous European Commission target of 40,000. EU states instead so far committed to sharing some 32,000 asylum seekers from Italy and Greece. Mr Tusk also took Mr Orban to task for comments in which the Hungarian leader said his country was being "overrun" with refugees who threatened to undermine Europe's Christian roots. He said: "Referring to Christianity in a public debate on migration must mean in the first place the readiness to show solidarity and sacrifice." The human cost of the crisis was also put into sharp focus on Wednesday when five children were among 12 migrants who drowned in Turkish waters while trying to reach Greece. Images of the washed-up body of a three-year-old boy, who died alongside his mother and five-year-old brother, circulated widely on social media. Czech unease at migrant numbering Five obstacles to an EU migrants deal Those who risk everything for a better life The word migrant is defined in the Oxford English Dictionary as "one who moves, either temporarily or permanently, from one place, area, or country of residence to another". A refugee is, according to the 1951 Refugee Convention, any person who "owing to a well-founded fear" of persecution is outside their country of nationality and "unable" or "unwilling" to seek the protection of that country. To gain the status, one has to go through the legal process of claiming asylum. The word migrant has traditionally been considered a neutral term, but some criticise the BBC and other media for using a word they say implies something voluntary, and should not be applied to people fleeing danger. Battle over words to describe migrants	Hungary's leader says the migrant crisis facing Europe is a "German problem" since Germany is where those arriving in the EU "would like to go".
A ruling will allow users and expert analysts to carry out repairs. But changes such as extracting and selling code would still breach copyright. Vehicle manufacturers opposed the move, saying repair garages could fix any issues. The ruling follows claims the right to modify software could have prevented the Volkswagen emissions scandal. The Library of Congress, which oversees the US Copyright Office, agreed with fair use advocates who argued that vehicle owners are entitled to modify their cars, which often involves altering software, Reuters reported. Manufacturers, including General Motors (GM) and Deere, spoke out in opposition. A GM representative referred to a statement from an industry group that said the new rules would weaken safety innovation. "Sensitive vehicle data could be easily manipulated, altered, or distributed - undetected - if these changes are implemented," the statement said. Deere spokesman Ken Golden said the company stands by its earlier opposition. But he added that some systems that transmit data from the vehicle to Deere could still be protected by copyright. Security researchers also pushed for copyright liability protection because computer programs are "pervasive" in modern machines and devices, including vehicles, home appliances and medical devices. "We are pleased that analysts will now be able to examine the software in the cars we drive without facing legal threats from car manufacturers," said Kit Walsh, a staff attorney for the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), which advocated for the rule changes. In the wake of the Volkswagen emissions deceit, the EFF said car manufacturers' software should not be protected from independent scrutiny. "When you entrust your health, safety, or privacy to a device, the law shouldn't punish you for trying to understand how that device works and whether it is trustworthy," Walsh blogged. The new rules must be renewed in three years, he said. Some US government agencies expressed serious reservations about the new rules, and the Environmental Protection Agency flatly opposed them. "EPA explained that vehicle modifications are often performed to increase engine power or boost fuel economy, but that these modifications increase vehicle emissions and thus violate the Clean Air Act," the Library of Congress said in its final rule. However, the new rules do not allow vehicle owners to break any other laws, the Library said, and will not take effect for a year so the EPA and other agencies have time to prepare.	Security researchers have been given the green light to hunt for flaws in car software by US authorities.
Brentford goalkeeper Daniel Bentley saved Aluko's initial shot but the winger followed up from close range to give Fulham a deserved half-time lead. The Bees did not register a single shot on goal in the first period. Ex-Brentford keeper David Button superbly saved Josh Clarke's effort before Cairney slotted in Fulham's second on the break in stoppage time. A win for Dean Smith's Bees would have taken them into the play-off places before Saturday's Championship fixtures, but they failed to find the net for the fourth time in six league games. Instead, they were leapfrogged by a Fulham side that is only outside the top six on goal difference. Fulham, who had scored 11 times in their previous four Championship matches, should have been further ahead by the interval. Full-backs Scott Malone and Ryan Fredericks were constant attacking threats but some wayward finishing let the visitors down, while Bentley rescued Brentford with saves from Stefan Johansen and Cairney. Brentford struggled to seriously test Button too often on his return to Griffin Park following his summer move to Craven Cottage. He made an excellent one-handed stop to deny Clarke an equaliser and Fulham survived a number of scrambles from set-pieces before Cairney's calmly-taken goal sealed victory. Brentford boss Dean Smith told BBC Radio London: "We didn't perform well and didn't deserve to win. We knew they would come and press us but our use of the ball was not good enough. "In the second half our midfielders had to get on the ball higher up the pitch and we were better. "While not playing at our best, we showed some spirit and stayed in the game until the 93rd minute." Fulham manager Slavisa Jokanovic told BBC Radio London: "I am very happy. We showed another positive step and our progress. We tried to show our identity and our style and I am very satisfied for my lads and the Fulham fans. "We didn't win in the last four games against Brentford and this is a nice present for people around us. "We are in a learning process and want to be better." Match ends, Brentford 0, Fulham 2.

Bomb disposal officers were sent to Birmingham's Lee Bank area on Friday and nearby roads were closed and cordoned off. The men, two aged 32 and 37 were arrested in Stoke-on-Trent and three others, aged 18, 24 and 28, were arrested in Birmingham. Magistrates granted police a further seven days to question the men. Detectives from the West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit appeared before London's Westminster Magistrates' Court via video link on Saturday to submit their request for a warrant of further detention, a spokesman said. The men were arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism. Ch Supt Sue Southern, from West Midlands Police, said: "The arrests of the five men were intelligence led and our investigation continues at full pace." A number of properties in the Stoke and Birmingham areas have been searched as part of the investigation. The BBC understands the force was dealing with two suspect devices that were found at a business in Lee Bank on Friday.	Police have been given more time to question five men arrested on suspicion of terrorism offences.
That steady stream of stories has led to the launch of a major public inquiry into their activities. The breadth and nature of what is being alleged is almost too big to grasp, but it fundamentally comes down to a simple question of whether elements of the police were out of control. So, here are seven key themes and allegations that lie in the road ahead - and some of the real practical and legal problems the inquiry faces. Some police officers had relationships with women whom they met within the protest movements they had been deployed to infiltrate. Last year, the Metropolitan Police paid one woman who had a child with an officer Â£425,000 in compensation. There are approximately a dozen civil claims for damages before the courts amid allegations that officers were expected to have relationships as part of their cover identity. But how many did so and under what circumstances? This is a huge challenge for the inquiry. How will it find out and inform the public if the undercover officer involved remains unknown, there are no records and, crucially, the partner never had any suspicions? During the 40-year history of the Special Demonstration Squad (SDS) - the police unit at the heart of many of the allegations - officers used 106 "covert identities". According to a published police review, some 42 of them were almost certainly taken from children who had died - and the parents did not know about it. In 2013, a senior officer said the practice wasn't sanctioned by Scotland Yard - yet it seemed to have gone on for years. How many names were used? Who authorised it? Should the parents have known? If the names of the dead children are revealed, will that identify the officers the police want to protect? The undercover affair has so far led to more than 50 convictions being quashed after a failure to disclose that officers had infiltrated protest groups later accused of criminality. The two largest cases relate to environmental protests at power stations, both of which involved Mark Kennedy, an officer with the National Public Order Intelligence Unit. He would drive protesters around, effectively facilitating demonstrations later found to have broken the law. A review for the Home Office said there could be a possible further 83 miscarriages of justice - although its author, Mark Ellison QC, couldn't be sure there were not more. So will the inquiry look at allegations that officers lied in court? John Jordan was convicted over his role in a protest in 1996 - but was cleared on appeal in 2013 after it emerged that his co-defendant was Jim Boyling, an undercover officer. The officer even gave evidence in character. Jordan has been taking legal action for a full explanation of what happened. Peter Francis, the only former SDS officer speaking publicly, says that Scotland Yard kept intelligence files on MPs during the 1990s. During his time in Special Branch, he says he saw files on 10 Labour MPs which he and others would regularly update. So what did that monitoring amount to? Was the information on MPs incidental, gathered as part of watching campaign groups? Or did some Scotland Yard chiefs want deeper intelligence on the MPs? Separate allegations have emerged that undercover officers also gathered information on some trade union activists. The most toxic allegation so far has been that Scotland Yard had a "spy" in the Lawrence family camp. He later had a meeting with a senior officer helping to prepare Scotland Yard for the public inquiry into the London teenager's murder. The exact nature of what information was gathered, why it was gathered and how it was used remains unclear. The then Metropolitan Police Commissioner and now peer, Lord Condon, has said that had he known of the existence of such undercover action in relation to the Lawrences, he would have stopped it. Peter Francis spent four years deep undercover and he eventually became mentally ill, suffering post-traumatic stress disorder. Today, he says some of what he was asked to do was wrong - and he wants senior officers to account for the way they deployed officers like him. He is not the only officer to have had concerns about the ethics of their work. Phase two of the inquiry is expected to look at the "operational governance and oversight" of undercover operations, including how officers are selected, trained, managed and cared for. The most important acronym in this inquiry stands for Neither Confirm Nor Deny. It's a legal position adopted by the police and other security agencies in cases involving protection of undercover officers or sensitive sources. The first potential legal battle will come if police will refuse to admit whether or not they had officers deployed in specific circumstances. Official reports have already revealed the existence of some of these undercover officers - such as the one who was in a campaign group close to the Lawrence family - but they remain anonymous. If officers remain in the shadows because, quite simply, they were incredibly good at their job, police chiefs will almost certainly argue that the public interest lies in protecting their anonymity because of their legal duty of care.	The allegations of wrongdoing by undercover police officers that have emerged since 2011 have been extraordinary.
Tony Tinley responded to The Sunday Times report that the company may spend research budgets overseas if government support for innovation is cut. Mr Tinley said he wanted the firm to commit itself to the city. Rolls-Royce said it invests in research and development "where the environment is supportive". The union fears that grants offered by the department for Business, Innovation and Skills, to firms like Rolls-Royce, could be turned into loans as a result of spending cuts. Mr Tinley, a senior regional Unite officer in the East Midlands, said: "If you move [research and development], the manufacturing goes with it. "You could be arguing that the whole presence of Rolls-Royce is being put at risk. "I get called a scaremonger for this but when I've sat and looked in the eyes of these people [senior management], I don't see that commitment." Dr Ian Jackson, from Staffordshire University's business school, said turning grants into loans could have a serious effect on Rolls-Royce. He said: "It would put at risk the qualified scientists and engineers not just at Rolls-Royce in Derby, but also the supply chain, and wider into the hinterland of what supports that." Rolls-Royce, which employs about 13,000 people in Derby, said in a statement: "Rolls-Royce has always maintained that we invest in research and development where the environment is supportive. "The location of research and technology is dependent on where the early stages of innovation happens, and the UK today has a compelling and competitive environment for Rolls-Royce to invest." A government spokesperson said: "We want the UK to be the best place in Europe to innovate and grow a business. "We are simplifying support for business, boosting collaboration and investing in research infrastructure on a record scale."	Hundreds of jobs could be lost if Rolls-Royce moves it research and development work out of Derby, a Unite union organiser has said.
An independent report commissioned by the Department of Health estimated these groups cost the NHS £2bn a year. Ministers said some of that spending was unavoidable, but said it would be realistic to save a quarter. Savings would come from deterring so-called health tourism, recovering money owed by other countries and a levy on non-European temporary residents. One senior doctor questioned the government's figures and said doctors should not have to spend time "vetting eligibility" of patients. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said he did not want to "turn GPs into border guards" and no-one would be denied emergency treatment, but foreign visitors must make a "fair contribution". Mr Hunt said he recognised the NHS's duty of care must "transcend" financial concerns, but collecting an extra £500m a year could pay for 4,000 extra doctors. "We have one of the most generous systems in the world when it comes to healthcare for foreign visitors, but it's time for action to ensure the NHS is a national health service - not an international one," he added. By Nick TriggleHealth correspondent The issue of which foreigners are entitled to treatment and which are not is complex. The first thing to say is if someone needs emergency care - for example if they have an accident - the NHS will treat them no matter where they come from. Another exemption is if someone has an infectious disease as treatment helps protect the wider public. Beyond that the UK has reciprocal agreements with most European countries and 28 other nations, including countries such as Canada and Australia. It means if their residents need care while here temporarily - either on holiday or working - they will be seen and the NHS will then reclaim the cost of that care from the other country. The research released by the Department of Health shows the NHS is not very good at clawing that money back. This is because of a perverse incentive in the system which ministers now want to rectify. Meanwhile, travelling to the UK deliberately for health treatment - so-called health tourism - is not allowed. The rules are less clear in other cases, such as expats and asylum seekers. The latest research is published in two separate reports by firms Prederi and Creative Research. The government has been criticised for using financial estimates from the Prederi report, but Mr Hunt said it was the "most thorough research there has ever been" in this area. The report itself notes that it is based on "incomplete data, sometimes of varying quality, and a large number of assumptions", but it says the estimates are the "best that can be made at present", and Mr Hunt said researchers had been "completely honest about what they do know and what they don't know". The government is currently consulting on the measures it will take to tackle this issue. It has already announced a £200-a-year levy on migrants from outside the European Economic Area (EEA) staying for between six months and five years, and Mr Hunt said this could raise £200m a year. A cost-recovery unit will also be set up to help hospitals claw back money they are owed by other governments for treating foreign nationals visiting the UK. Meanwhile, "deliberate health tourism" - whereby people travel to the UK to get NHS care - is estimated by Prederi to cost between £60m and £80m a year. The report's authors concede this figure is "uncertain" and the "plausible range" of the cost is £20m-£100m. Frequent visitors "taking advantage" by registering with GPs and getting access to prescriptions and some hospital referrals cost the NHS a further £50m-£200m a year, the report adds. The government accepts it cannot recoup all of this money and entirely stop health tourism and so it has put forward the "conservative" £500m figure. To achieve this, it said a better system of identifying when visitors and migrants got treatment was needed. More details on what this will involve will be revealed in the coming weeks. Free NHS care is offered to anyone with living in the UK who has temporary or permanent permission to do so. Asylum seekers, non-EEA nationals who do not have permission to live in the UK, British ex-pats and visitors usually have to pay for treatment. The UK has reciprocal agreements with most European nations and 28 other countries, and under these visitors are given free NHS care. The NHS should claim these costs back from the relevant governments - but the research suggests just £73m a year is recouped out of more than £460m at present. This is because there is a perverse incentive in the system whereby if they declare the fact they have treated a foreign national it is up to the individual hospital to chase up the home nation for the money whereas if they do not declare it they get money from the NHS system for seeing a patient entitled to care. Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said: "We are not against improving the recovery of costs from people with no entitlement to NHS treatment." But he added the figures were based on a "large number of assumptions" and was more about "spin than substance". Dr Chaand Nagpaul, chairman of the British Medical Association's GPs committee, said the government's £500m savings figure was "exaggerated", partly because it did not take account of the costs of implementing its plans. He said migrants paying the proposed £200-a-year levy could be more likely to use the NHS to "get their money's worth", and he said the cost of a single hospital outpatient appointment would be more than £200. Dr Nagpaul said doctors should not be distracted from their work in order to check the eligibility of patients for treatments. Dr Clare Gerada, chairwoman of the Royal College of GPs, said it was imperative GPs were not tasked with being a "new border agency" in policing the NHS. "The risks to public health that will arise from these proposals are also very real. They will deter people from seeking medical help in the early stages of illness when they can be dealt with cost-effectively and efficiently in primary care, rather than requiring expensive specialist care and increasing admissions to emergency departments," she said. Jonathan Portes, of the Institute of Economic and Social Research think tank, said the research revealed the extent of deliberate health tourism had been "hugely overstated" and was in fact a "very small part of NHS expenditure".	Up to £500m could be recovered from overseas visitors and migrants using the NHS every year, ministers believe.

Bailey Gwynne died after being stabbed in the heart at Cults Academy in October. His 16-year-old killer - who cannot be named for legal reasons - had denied murder but was convicted of the lesser charge of culpable homicide. He was sentenced by Lady Stacey at the High Court in Edinburgh. He will be supervised for two years after release. The boy was handed an eight-year sentence - and the supervision - for the killing, and another year for weapons offences. He will begin serving his sentence in a young offenders institution because of his age. The judge told him: "If you had not carried a knife, the exchange of insults between you and Bailey Gwynne would have led at worst to a fist fight - and certainly not loss of life." Lady Stacey said the killer had shown "significant regret" and "understanding of the loss you have caused". She said he chose to buy weapons online and take them to school on several occasions which was a "very serious matter". The judge added: "Nothing that I can say, nor any sentence that I impose, will do anything to lessen the grief that Bailey Gwynne's family and friends feel. "The shock of his death at such a young age was felt in the wider community; nothing I can say or do can alleviate that. "I have decided that an extended sentence is the only appropriate disposal, taking into account all of the circumstances including your age. "I hope that will lead to you being both punished and helped towards rehabilitation while you are detained in a structured environment. "Following your release you will be supervised to maximise the chance of your successful re integration into society." Defence counsel Ian Duguid said Bailey Gwynne's killer was an "ordinary, naive teenager" who recognised the gravity of what had happened. He said the teenager was "constantly monitored by psychiatric services", had post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and was medicated for nightmares and depression. The fight began after an argument about a biscuit. A jury at the High Court in Aberdeen took an hour and 40 minutes to find him guilty. Following the verdict, Bailey's mother said the outcome of trial would not bring her "beloved" son back. The youth was also found guilty of two further charges of having a knife and knuckleduster in school. Aberdeen City Council said the case had been "devastating" for the families affected and staff and pupils at Cults Academy. The findings of an independent review into the circumstances surrounding the death of Bailey Gwynne are expected to be published in September. BBC Scotland revealed concerns about the killer were voiced nine years ago when, as a primary pupil, he threw rocks at another child. The incident resulted in the victim being treated for concussion.	A teenager who stabbed a 16-year-old to death in an Aberdeen school has been jailed for nine years.
Media playback is not supported on this device The 40-year-old won Olympic heptathlon bronze for Britain in 2004 and has been upgraded to two more bronze medals from 2008 after retrospective drug tests. All world records set before 2005 could be rewritten under a new proposal from European Athletics, after the sport's latest doping scandal. Sotherton said tweaking events would create "a new slate" and new records. She said: "Could we go back to yards or run 101m instead of 100m? "We all know that some of the records are completely out there. But not all of those records were achieved by people who cheated. "Scrapping those records is unfair on those athletes. And what about my pre-2005 performances? Did they happen? Does this apply to national records too?" Sotherton referred to the IAAF's decision to remodel the men's javelin in 1986. Changes were made to the javelin's design because of increasingly frequent flat landings. All existing records were reset after the change, but not erased. "I am open to the discussion - for the greater good of the sport it's a good thing," she added.	Kelly Sotherton says athletics chiefs should consider tweaking events rather than rewriting existing world records.
Media playback is not supported on this device Koeman has advised midfielder James McCarthy not to join the Ireland squad after previously saying he had been "massively overloaded" by the Republic. Republic manager Martin O'Neill said this week that Koeman was "bleating" about the matter. Keane added: "Maybe Everton need to look at their own training schedule." McCarthy, 25, has been ruled out of the Republic's World Cup qualifier against Austria on Saturday because of a hamstring injury. He has missed most of his club's season because of injury but played in the Republic's qualifier wins over Georgia and Moldova last month. That angered Everton boss Koeman, who has only seen McCarthy play 33 minutes of competitive action for the Premier League club since then. However, Keane says he "could not care less" about Koeman's concerns - and also criticised previous Toffees manager Roberto Martinez. "Everton traditionally have always had brilliant Irish players doing well for the football club, so they shouldn't be so quick to stop Irish players coming to play for Ireland," said the former Manchester United midfielder. "We have had a problem previously with Martinez - I think he was slightly over the top. "Every time, we felt, the Everton players were turning up - and this is not a criticism of the players, this is more from Everton and their staff - they were always carrying knocks. "I always felt the Everton players were going to turn up on crutches or crawling in the hotel door, and now it looks like we are probably going to have that issue again with Koeman. I hope not. "Maybe Everton as a club need to - and it's a brilliant football club - maybe their players need to toughen up a little bit."

The 24-year-old, who played 16 games on loan at Kilmarnock last season, will compete with James Tavernier. Hodson started his career at Watford and played 51 games in three seasons at MK Dons after a loan at Brentford. He joins new faces Matt Gilks, Clint Hill, Joey Barton, Niko Kranjcar, Jordan Rossiter, Matt Crooks and Josh Windass at Ibrox. Rangers paid an undisclosed fee for Hodson, who was part of Northern Ireland's squad at Euro 2016, but did not feature in any of their four matches.	Rangers have made right-back Lee Hodson their eighth summer signing on a three-year deal from MK Dons.
The Richmond Park and North Kingston MP said he was "honoured" after winning 70% of the 9,227 votes cast using an online primary system. He beat London Assembly Member Andrew Boff, MEP Syed Kamall and London's deputy mayor for crime and policing Stephen Greenhalgh. Mr Goldsmith's main rival is likely to be Labour's Sadiq Khan. Mr Khan beat former cabinet minister Tessa Jowell and a number of other current MPs to win the Labour nomination last month. Caroline Pidgeon is the Lib Dem candidate, Sian Berry will contest the election for the Greens and UKIP has chosen its culture spokesman Peter Whittle. Former Respect MP George Galloway is also running. Mr Goldsmith, who was the favourite for the Tory nomination, balloted his constituents earlier this year to seek permission to stand. At the very point of his entry into the race for London mayor, Zac Goldsmith's decision revealed two big characteristics. Only a politician with an acute sense of accountability would have sought permission to stand through a ballot of his constituency members in Richmond and North Kingston. Only someone with his personal wealth would have been able to afford the estimated Â£60,000 cost of doing it. Both characteristics could come to feature heavily in the months to come. Read the whole article He won Friday's vote comfortably, getting 6,514 votes, more than the other three candidates combined. Syed Kamall came second with 1,477 votes ahead of Stephen Greenhalgh (864) and Andrew Boff (372). Mr Goldsmith - who first entered Parliament in 2010 - told the BBC's Daily Politics that he hoped his environmental record would appeal to Green and Lib Dem voters and he also hoped to "reach out" to UKIP supporters frustrated with politics as usual and the UK's relationship with the EU. Mr Goldsmith, who has confirmed he would stand down from Parliament if he became mayor, triggering a by-election, said he wanted to build on current mayor Boris Johnson's achievements. But he said anyone who attempted to replicate Mr Johnson's style of leadership would be "deluded" as he was a "unique figure" in British politics. "If people are in the market for a 'Boris mark two' are going to be very disappointed," he said, adding that people wanted someone who "will bend George Osborne's ear and get a good deal for London". He also told the BBC News Channel that high-polluting vehicles should be "phased out" of the capital's streets and that his biggest priority would be housing. Both Mr Khan and Mr Goldsmith oppose a new runway at Heathrow airport, a fact described by the British Chambers of Commerce as "depressing". Mr Goldsmith is also promising more transport investment to prevent London "grinding to a halt" and to "protect, enhance and improve access" to green spaces. Current mayor Boris Johnson will step down next year after two terms in office. He is also currently the MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip, having been returned to Parliament in May. Some Conservatives have called for an inquiry into the mayoral election process after only 9,227 people voted - compared with a 87,884 turnout for the Labour contest. In an attempt to open up the contest to people who weren't Conservative members, anyone on the electoral roll was able register to vote for Â£1. But one of the campaign teams told the BBC earlier this month the process "looked chaotic". Speaking on the BBC's Daily Politics, Mr Galloway dismissed Mr Goldsmith as a "Great Gatsby figure" who could not relate to most Londoners' lives and Mr Khan as "a very boring man". He revealed policies including compulsorily purchasing any house left vacant for more than a year and having 50% of all homes in the capital as social housing.	Zac Goldsmith will contest the 2016 London mayoral election for the Conservatives, it has been announced.
Media playback is not supported on this device Fury upset Klitschko last November to secure the WBA, IBF and WBO heavyweight titles but was charged by the UK Anti-Doping Agency (Ukad) in June. A provisional suspension was lifted pending an independent investigation. Fury, who fights Klitschko at the Manchester Arena, has denied any wrongdoing and threatened to sue Ukad. Co-promoter Frank Warren said: "After all the injuries and contractual problems, there is no danger of the fight not happening." I'm just waiting for my revenge. I'm obsessed with the goal of getting the belts back. The road to Fury-Klitschko II has been a rocky one. It was originally scheduled for July before the 28-year-old Englishman turned an ankle in training. In June, the media got wind that Fury and his cousin Hughie, also a heavyweight boxer, had been charged with a doping offence after the banned substance nandrolone was allegedly discovered in their urine samples. However, the samples were taken 19 months ago, nine months before Fury outpointed his Ukrainian rival, 40, in Dusseldorf. Fury claims he was told by Ukad that he would face no action over the test and that a blood test taken at the time, as well as all tests since, revealed no traces. Hughie's case will also be reviewed by the National Anti-Doping Panel. Fury's long-time promoter Mick Hennessy said he was "very, very confident" that his fighter would be exonerated after the investigation. Fury did not attend Monday's news conference in London because his car broke down on the way down from his home in Morecambe. But his uncle and trainer Peter Fury said the boxer was "very upset" with Ukad and the way he has been treated by the British public. "There's been chaos around this fight, especially with Ukad slipping statements out to the press," said Peter Fury. "Tyson was found guilty before he was even tried. But I told him that the main thing is he knows what the truth is and that it will come out eventually." At a news conference to announce the first fight between the two rivals, Fury turned up as Batman, prompting Klitschko to speculate that perhaps he had dressed as the Invisible Man on Monday. Klitschko, who had threatened to sue Fury's team over alleged contract tampering, also suggested his rival might not even show up on fight night. "I wouldn't have been surprised if Tyson Fury had turned up and sung a song, so I'm not surprised he hasn't turned up at all," said Klitschko, whose defeat by Fury in their first encounter was his first for more than 11 years. "Even if it doesn't happen in October, I will wait. I've never had such a long break between fights but I've been active, even if I haven't been competing. "I'm just waiting for my revenge. I just hope he's going to turn up. "I'm enjoying being the challenger. It has been a great experience for me and it has made me obsessed with the goal of getting the belts back again." "I don't feel my age. I'm still capable of performing as an athlete and I've just gained more experience as a fighter. And I'm not concerned about ring rust, because ring rust is in your head." Asked how the rematch would be different, Klitschko said: "The end of the fight is going to be different. I'm not just obsessed about winning this fight, I'm obsessed about winning impressively." Since beating Klitschko, Fury has been stripped of his IBF title for refusing to fight the governing body's mandatory challenger. The IBF belt is now held by Fury's compatriot Anthony Joshua, while American Deontay Wilder is the WBC champion.

A report by the Food and Agriculture Organization said agriculture accounted for about a fifth of emissions, which it said needed to be reduced. The State of Food & Agriculture 2016 report said "business as usual" would leave millions at risk from hunger. Last year, nations adopted a UN goal of ending hunger by 2030. "The climate is changing, so agriculture must change too," explained Rob Voss, director of FAO's Agricultural Development Economics division. "We are saying that because agriculture is already very affected by the impacts of climate change, particularly the countries in the tropical zones. "Also, agriculture is contributing itself to about one fifth of the global emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases," Mr Voss, who headed the team that produced the FAO State of Food & Agriculture 2016 report, added. "If we continue along the present pathways then we will not be able to [deliver] food security around the world and we will not be able to stabilise the climate." As a result, he told BBC News, there was a need for "major changes" to take place in the sector. "One of the challenges is agriculture itself. As soon as we shovel the ground then we are already releasing greenhouse gas emissions. Also, as it is so dependent on water and quality of land, any impact from the change in climate has a direct impact." Therefore, he said, the challenge was bearing these changes in mind and looking at ways to shift to a more sustainable footing. "A lot of the technologies that are available that allow us to do things differently do face a number of hurdles, especially when it comes to smallholder farmers in developing countries.' These include the cost of changing the way farmers produce their food; knowledge of shifting to the novel ways of farming; urbanisation; access to water. In terms of making the change to deliver a robust global food system, Mr Voss said the report highlighted four steps that could be taken: "First, put in the steps that would help farmers switch to more sustainable practices, such as more efficient use of fertilizers and using heat tolerant and drought resistant crop varieties." He added that management systems, such as agroforestry - which places forestry cultivation around farmlands, would also be beneficial as it helps farmers build in great resilience against the impacts of climate change. "Secondly, we need to work harder to increase the capacity of soils and forestry to sequestrate carbon. Deforestation and changes to land-use is one of the major sources of emissions from the sector. "A third area where we can immediately start work on is to reduce food losses and waste. We estimate that about one third of the food we produce gets lost in the post-harvest process or gets wasted at the consumer end. "The fourth area, which is more challenging, is to try and do something about people's diets. What we have been seeing around the world is a clear shift towards increasing demands for food products that put a lot more pressure on natural resources." The report observed: "Rebalancing diets towards less animal-sourced foods would make an important contribution in this direction, with probable co-benefits for human health." FAO director-general Jose Graziano da Silva said that the coming twelve months should be about "putting commitments into action", referring to the adoption of the UN Sustainable Development Goal of delivering "zero hunger" by 2030. He also observed that agriculture was set to be one of the main topics for discussion at the forthcoming UN climate summit in Morocco in November. "Climate change threatens all dimensions of food security," Mr Graziano da Silva warned. "It will expose both urban and rural poor to higher and more volatile food prices. It will also affect food availability by reducing the productivity of crops, livestock and fisheries." He stated: "Hunger, poverty and climate change need to be tackled together."

The singer-songwriter appeared on two of the festival's smaller stages - the iArena on Friday night and the Other Voices stage on Saturday. His low-key appearances came a week after he played three sold-out solo shows at Wembley Stadium. Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds will close the festival's 10th anniversary event with a headline slot on Sunday. Portishead headlined the event on Saturday, and were joined by Radiohead frontman Thom Yorke before he played his own unannounced set at the iArena later that night. Mercury Prize winners Alt-J headlined on Friday. The bill also included music from the Manic Street Preachers and Laura Marling, comedy from Jason Manford and Ruby Wax and theatre companies like Kneehigh and Paines Plough. Sheeran played the festival at the start of his career and grew up in nearby Framlingham. He is now one of the Britain's biggest pop stars, having sold more than two million copies of his second album X in the UK. He announced his Friday night set on Twitter about an hour in advance. By the time word had spread, estimates put the crowd numbers at the woodland arena at between 1,000-3,000. The Guardian's critic Harriet Gibsone said he played an hour-long set comprising covers of songs like Blackstreet's No Diggity, Stevie Wonder's Superstition and Bill Withers' Ain't No Sunshine. Olly Gregson, 18, from Sussex, said: "It was an amazing show, really intimate. "Everyone was dancing and singing along. That's the best time I've ever seen him, just because it was so small. You see him in stadiums, arenas and stuff, but it's obviously amazing, the intimacy, so close to it." The following night's set was shorter but even more intimate. The festival's blog said: "Ed himself admits that he wasn't planning this, he was just having some fun. "So it came to be that a little before midnight at the Other Voices stage, Ed walks on to perhaps no more than 80 people, guitar in hand, and breaks into Thinking Out Loud." Sheeran went on to play Nina Simone's Feelin' Good and was joined by Snow Patrol's Jonny Quinn and Nathan Connolly for the band's hit Chasing Cars. The setting was a far cry from Wembley Stadium, where Sheeran played for 80,000 people last Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Following a set by The Unthanks, a small crowd of about 150 people in the Other Voices room were treated to a short surprise set by Ed Sheeran. Taking to the stage shortly before midnight, Sheeran told the crowd: "I'm quite cut at the moment, wasn't expecting to play." Armed with just his guitar, and minus his loop pedals, he played a traditional Irish song and a Nina Simone cover before being joined on stage by two members of Snow Patrol to play Chasing Cars. And with that, he was gone.	Singer Ed Sheeran has delighted fans at the Latitude Festival in Suffolk by playing two surprise sets.
Police later named the woman as Joy Robson, 50, from the Isle of Skye. The boy was taken to hospital but police said his condition was not believed to be life-threatening. The incident happened on the first stage of the Highland Car Club Snowman Rally in Glenurquhart Forest, at Balnain. The rally was abandoned. It had been the opening round of the 2013 Scottish Rally Championship. Officers said one other person had been hurt in the collision but they were not seriously injured and were described as "walking wounded". The injured eight-year-old was taken to Raigmore Hospital in Inverness. Neither the driver nor the co-driver of the rally car were injured in the incident. In a statement, the Highland Car Club said: "Following an incident on special stage 1 of the Snowman Rally in which an adult spectator was fatally injured the event has been abandoned. "The club extends its sympathies to the families of those involved." The statement said the club would be co-operating fully with Northern Constabulary's investigation. The event attracted 110 competing crews and was due to include five stages.	A woman has died and an eight year-old boy was injured after a rally car left a forest track and hit spectators in the Highlands.
The move mirrors an update by Apple in September that allowed ad-blockers to be installed as extensions for the Safari browser. Blockers on Samsung phones will have to be added in the same way and will not come as standard. The new browser has begun rolling out for Android Lollipop or higher users. Popular ad-blockers, Adblock Fast and Crystal, have already been made available for Samsung phones. As well as making web pages less cluttered, ad-blockers often improve browsers' performance - and reduce the draw on phone batteries and data plans. "Those who use ad-blockers will likely use other browsers than the default one," said advertising industry analyst Daniel Knapp at IHS. "It's nonetheless important for Samsung to jump on the ad-blocking bandwagon." "It wants to show customers that it is a premium brand that protects them as well as Apple." Mr Knapp also told the BBC there had been a "seismic change" in the ad industry, in which marketing budgets were increasingly being moved from traditional forms of advertising to, for example, sponsorship deals. He said it was those most highly prized by advertisers, young and affluent users, who were more likely to use ad-blockers in the first place. "I think it's an expression of massive consumer dissatisfaction with the way the ad industry works," he said. Ad-blockers work by removing scripts in web page code that would otherwise pull content from ad networks' servers. In November, 18% of British adults online were using some form of ad-blocker, up 3% from June, according to a report from the Internet Advertising Bureau (IAB). Meanwhile, in Facebook's annual financial filing, the social network announced advertising earnings of $5.64bn (Â£3.9bn) for the fourth quarter of 2015 but warned ad-blockers could "adversely affect" future profits. "If such technologies continue to proliferate, in particular with respect to mobile platforms, our future financial results may be harmed," it said. But Mr Knapp said companies such as Facebook were less likely than other content publishers to be affected by mobile web ad-blockers because ads could still be delivered via their third-party apps. "Think of ad-blockers being admitted to iOS 9," he said. "They were all exclusively focused on the in-browser environment - not for third-party apps like Facebook."	The latest version of the default web browser on Samsung's Android phones will allow users to install ad-blocker extensions.
On Wednesday, the electric carmaker reported a first quarter loss of $282m (Â£195m) up from $154m last year. The loss was in line with investors' expectations, and the announcement that it was increasing production sent its shares up 4% in after-hours trading. Tesla had been struggling to ramp up production of its cars including its newest Model X SUV. Production of the Model X rose from 507 in the fourth quarter of 2015 to 2,659 in the first quarter of 2016. The company confirmed it was on track to deliver 80,000 to 90,000 electric vehicles this year. Tesla said it had seen demand rise across all its models, especially its Model 3 - the carmaker's first mass-market product. Deliveries of the Model 3 are due to hit the market in 2017 and the company received 325,000 orders for the car within a week of announcing it. This could result in $14bn in future sales. To meet that demand Tesla has cut two years off its timeline for ramping up production. "Increasing production five-fold over the next two years will be challenging and will likely require some additional capital, but this is our goal," chief executive Elon Musk said in a latter to investors. Tesla said its capital expenditure - money spent to grow the company - would probably increase by 50%. Some investors have been concerned about Tesla's cash flow. The company has been spending money to increase its manufacturing facilities. Though it has seen orders rise, the carmaker has yet to make a profit. Since the start of the year Tesla has faced some production hurdles. A shortage of parts for its Model X stalled production in January and February. On Wednesday, Tesla announced two of its manufacturing heads were stepping down from their roles. Greg Reichow, vice president of production will take a leave of absence as soon as a successor can be found. Josh Ensign, vice-president of manufacturing, is also leaving the company.	Tesla Motors says it is on track to produce 500,000 vehicles in 2018, two years earlier than expected.
The watchdog said these were some of the "main barriers" to local authority participation in the scheme. It estimates a need for 10,664 school places and 4,930 homes for the 20,000 refugees due to be taken in by 2020. The government said it remained on track with its programme. The NAO's report highlighted the government's success in having "expanded the original programme at speed to achieve a new target" of resettling 1,000 refugees by last Christmas, and progress in improving refugees' own experiences of the programme. However, it said there could be significant problems in meeting the target of resettling 20,000 refugees if pledges of help from local authorities did not become firm offers. 10,664 childcare and school places needed to meet UK commitment 4,930 homes required 2,659  refugees resettled so far 49% are under the age of 18 55% are survivors of torture or violence 118 local authorities have volunteered to resettle families Participation by local authorities is voluntary, and they can make what is known as an "indicative pledge" to resettle refugees before upgrading this to a "firm offer" once accommodation, support and other services have been secured. Although there has been a 97% success rate for allocating refugees to firm offers, by the end of June 2016 there were only 125 firm offers to cover 1,078 cases of refugees accepted for resettlement. According to the NAO, local authorities say the main thing preventing them from participating fully is that they are struggling to find suitable housing and enough school places. The report says that just under a third (31%) of refugees settled so far are of school age. Of those refugees still to come to the UK through the programme, an estimated 7,655 will be of school age and a further 3,009 will become old enough to enter the education system during the programme. But the NAO said school places were already "in short supply" and cited its 2013 report on funding for new school places, which revealed that about one in five primary schools were full or over capacity. The NAO also estimates that about 20% of children in the resettlement programme are expected to have special educational needs. This means local authorities will probably have to provide more than 1,500 special educational needs places, the NAO said - and some local authorities have already "turned away cases because they were unable to provide the required places". The programme so far has required 655 homes and is estimated to need a further 4,930 before 2020, based on the size of families resettled so far. Some councils had been successful in partnering with the private rental sector to house refugees, the report said, but others were "struggling to do so". Local authorities in areas where accommodation costs are high also have concerns about finding affordable accommodation for refugees given the current housing benefit cap. This has meant only 11% of refugees have been settled in areas such as London and the South East. Meg Hillier MP, chair of the Public Accounts Committee, said: "Local authorities should be applauded for stepping up to help these people in desperate need. "But already under pressure local authorities will have to find over 10,600 childcare and school places, and nearly 5,000 homes over the course of the programme as well as social and community support services. "We need to be convinced that the government is committed to supporting local authorities in their efforts and is clear about its expectations and funding beyond the first year of a refugee's stay in the UK." Refugee Council head of advocacy Lisa Doyle said it was "fantastic" that UK communities were welcoming refugees. She said: "Each Syrian refugee welcomed by the UK will have their life transformed, if not saved by this programme. "The UK government must build on this success by offering more refugees safe passage here, particularly by enabling more refugees with family here to join them smoothly and swiftly." Refugee Action chief executive Stephen Hale said: "We are pleased that the programme has been established but I think there is a lot to do to help refugees integrate into Britain." He said the government's funding of English language classes was "crucial" in helping refugees integrate. A government spokesman said: "We ask local authorities to consider carefully whether they have the necessary infrastructure and support networks before a resettlement occurs. "We will only resettle individuals to a particular area once we've ensured these arrangements, including school places and housing, are in place." He added: "The level of funding enables local authorities to provide vulnerable refugees with a safe environment and the chance to rebuild their lives."	The government's Syrian vulnerable persons resettlement programme could be "at risk" because of a lack of school places and accommodation, a National Audit Office report has warned.
The city in western Germany is putting 2,500 police officers on the streets for the week-long event. Germany was shocked by the New Year assaults, largely blamed on migrants. More than 100 women were victims, but the full scale only emerged later. Separately, police have arrested three suspected Islamist militants in raids. Cologne sex attacks: Women describe 'terrible' assaults The raids on flats and offices took place on Thursday in Berlin, Lower Saxony and North Rhine-Westphalia. The two men and one woman detained are among four suspected of links to the so-called Islamic State group. One of those held was being sought by Algerian authorities, and they may have been planning an attack in Germany, police said. The New Year unrest in Cologne fuelled German unease about a huge influx of asylum seekers. Two men - a Tunisian and a Moroccan - have been charged over the Cologne offences. But in total there were 945 complaints to Cologne police after the New Year trouble, 559 of them allegations of sexual assault. Thirty-five suspects are being investigated. German authorities spoke of a new type of crime, in which gangs of drunken men - described as North African - targeted women. Cologne resident Miriam was attacked as she and a friend made her way home on New Year's Eve. She said she was going to the carnival celebrations "but with really mixed feelings". "I'm wondering if something like that could happen again." Miriam's mother, Jozi, said the incident changed the way she sees migrants. "We live in a multicultural area with lots of Moroccans, I've never had a second thought before - we're friends, we greet each other, talk to each other. It was all fine. But now I'm looking at it with different eyes." Organisers have not said how many people have attended this year's carnival, but correspondents say the numbers are much lower than in previous years. Police will be present at a new "Security Point" for women near Cologne Cathedral - the area where most of the assaults took place during New Year celebrations. Police have been trialling "body cams" which can film suspects during incidents. German authorities have also brought in British face recognition experts to help identify those involve in the attacks on New Year's Eve. Known as "super-recognisers", the officers from the London Metropolitan Police can recognise up to 95% of the faces they have seen - compared to about 20% for most people. Migration to Germany from outside the EU soared to a record 1.1 million last year. The Cologne assaults contributed to a slump in the approval rating of Chancellor Angela Merkel. She has been criticised by conservative allies, as well as by many opposition politicians, for having welcomed so many asylum seekers to Germany. The many Syrian and Iraqi refugees generally get asylum, but many economic migrants from outside the EU are also trying to settle in Germany.	Cologne has beefed up security for the city's annual carnival, after many women suffered sexual assaults and robberies there on New Year's Eve.
The injured girl was riding the the Hogwarts Express train with her family, who were on holiday from Tennessee visiting Universal Studios in Orlando. Police described the explosion as a "fireball", burning the girl's face. "It was just a weird, freak accident," Lieutenant Dan Brady told the Orlando Sentinel. "It wasn't a big explosion but was definitely enough to scare everyone who was in that cab of the train," he added. Her name has not been released. The girl was riding the train, which connects Universal Studios with the Island of Adventure theme park, at about 15:30 local time (19:30 GMT) on Saturday when the device exploded. The girl suffered mild burns to her face, arm, and leg, and was taken to hospital. The vapouriser was inside another man's pocket when it malfunctioned, causing minor burns to his leg. The explosion burned a hole in a seat, but otherwise there was no significant damage to the train, officials say. Universal Studios shut down the ride temporarily to allow detectives to investigate. The Wizarding World of Harry Potter opened at Universal Studios in 2010.	A 14-year-old girl suffered burns on a Harry Potter ride when another passenger's electronic cigarette exploded, police in Florida say.
As reported in the Daventry Express, Sam Chambers, coach of Weedon Bec Primary School, sent his CV to the FA after England crashed out of Euro 2016. "I feel like the perfect candidate as I have guided my school... to an unbeaten 2015-16 season," he wrote. Ladbrokes has made him a 1,000/1 outsider for the job. Roy Hodgson stood down as England manager after the shock 2-1 defeat to Iceland last week. Jessica Bridge from the bookmaker said: "Stranger things have happened in the last 12 months, like Leicester City winning the Premier League, so it's not out of the realms of possibility. "Sam enters the record books as one of the greatest sporting underdogs of all time." Mr Chambers, who describes himself as a "sports enthusiast", faces stiff competition from current favourites Jurgen Klinsmann and Sam Allardyce, but says he has the passion to be a success in the job. "I, along with millions across the nation, saw our beloved team fall to the minnows that are Iceland," he wrote in his covering letter to the FA. "It is my intention, should I be given the opportunity, to re-kindle the enthusiasm of the nation for the round-ball game." Elaborating on his school's impressive season, Mr Chambers added he had guided his side to an unbeaten campaign - even though they faced "mighty teams such as Woodford Halse CE Primary Academy". He ends the letter with an optimistic "I look forward to hearing from you all!" The FA is yet to comment on Mr Chambers' application. Earlier this year, a seven-year-old boy failed in his quest to become Inverness Caledonian Thistle's new manager, despite a pledge that his headmaster would probably let him leave school early "for important matches and training".	The coach of a primary school football team has applied for the England job, saying he is the "perfect candidate" to succeed Roy Hodgson.
Provisional data from the Department for Transport (DfT) showed the 3% rise came alongside a 2.2% increase in traffic in the 12 months to September. AA president Edmund King said the death toll was the "equivalent of three plane crashes" and called for more action. Separate DfT figures suggest about 240 deaths in 2014 involved drivers over the legal alcohol limit. Officials said the rise in deaths in the year ending September 2015 was not "statistically significant" - meaning the increase was "probably to do with a combination of factors that have come about by chance, rather than any specific change". Steve Gooding, director of automotive research charity the RAC Foundation, said: "Forty-nine more people dying on the roads might not be statistically significant, but try telling that to their family and friends. "It is true that traffic is on the rise again and that might partly explain why the downward trend in road deaths has plateaued in recent years. "But the pressing question is: what do we now do to get back on track?" Neil Greig, the Institute of Advanced Motorists' director of policy and research, said that although drink-drive deaths were "flatlining", the numbers were still "unacceptable". He called for the drink-drive limit elsewhere in Britain to be lowered to be in line with Scotland. In 2014, the Scottish government reduced the limit from 80mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood to 50mg. The DfT said the new estimated figure of 240 road deaths involving people over the legal alcohol limit in 2014 meant the level was unchanged from 2013. Roads Minister Andrew Jones said: "Britain continues to have some of the safest roads in the world but we cannot be complacent on road safety and are determined to do more. "We launched our road safety plan last year which includes plans for tougher penalties for people using mobile phones while driving, extra money to crack down on drug-drivers and funding to train the next generation of cyclists."	Some 1,780 people died on Britain's roads last year - 49 more than the previous year, new figures suggest.
The 40ft (12m) whale was discovered by wardens at the Holkham National Nature Reserve on Thursday. The Cetacean Strandings Investigation Programme (CSIP) was contacted and a post-mortem examination is expected to be carried out. Evolutionary biologist Dr Ben Garrod said it was "really unusual" for a fin whale to be found on the east coast. For more on the whale and other stories, visit the BBC Norfolk Live page "It should not be in those waters," he said. "We see fin whales occasionally on the southern coast or more the west coast of the UK, so Ireland, right up to Scotland. "But you never get them in the North Sea so what it was doing there, we have no idea at the moment." Dr Garrod, who is based at the Anglia Ruskin University in Cambridge, said it was not yet known what killed the whale. He said: "There are no obvious signs of net entanglement, no obvious signs of boat strike, not a clue, and that's what is so interesting." The beach has remained open but Holkham Estate has urged members of the public not to venture close to the whale carcass and to keep dogs on leads. Dr Garrod also urged members of the public to show the whale respect. He said graffiti was found on the sperm whales which were washed up on the Norfolk coast in January. "I would be heartbroken to see that happen to this big, beautiful visitor to our waters," said Dr Garrod.	An expert has been left puzzled as to why a fin whale has washed up on the coast of north Norfolk.
It's not natural Labour territory. The party has lost every election here since 1950. At this year's general election, the Conservatives were returned with an 18,000 majority. But the people of Chelmsford, in Essex, were queuing round the block outside the city's civic theatre to hear Jeremy Corbyn. If this had been a football crowd, there would have been purveyors of hot pies. If it had been an audience waiting to the see the latest cinema blockbuster, there would be popcorn vendors. But it's the 87th Corbyn rally of the Labour leadership campaign. So the products being paraded at the venue were food for thought - newspapers from parties and factions to the left, or on the left, of Labour - Socialist Worker, Socialist Appeal, Labour Briefing. There were almost as many people here as there have been Corbyn rebellions against his own party leadership. So why were 500 giving up their evening to hear the veteran left winger? "He's a breath of fresh air," says Helen Davenport, a teacher who had left the Labour party for the Greens. "I gave up hope," she says. "But now there's an alternative. I like his ideas on renationalising rail and he has a more sympathetic policy on immigration. He has the wisdom of Tony Benn." Sasha McLoughlin agrees: "It's the first time a Labour leader has represented me in years. You vote Labour because that's what you do but it's so exciting to have a leftwing leader, not a Tory in disguise." Further up the line was Gerard Darcy. He says he wasn't a natural Corbyn supporter but found him to be "straight-talking". He went on: "There's no artifice. No spin. The other candidates are preened, moulded. He looks like a 70s sociology lecturer but people are now in to the issues, not the image - no one cares about what his smile looks like." He says Andy Burnham would be "excellent" but is now his second choice. And the phenomenon that is Corbynmania continued inside the venue. In the media scrum that now surrounds him everywhere he goes, he was asked by Finnish television to give advice to their social democrats, and by Le Monde to comment on French President Francois Hollande's move to the right. Incidentally, he responds that Hollande "hasn't felt sufficiently able to challenge austerity". Not a criticism he would level at himself. So how has a left-winger who had languished on the backbenches  - someone to whom Ed Miliband's former chief of staff Lucy Powell admits to never having spoken - now become something of an international celebrity? He seems quite bemused yet nonplussed by the attention. He needed the support of 35 Labour MPs to get on the ballot and he points out he only got enough nominations with just one minute fifteen seconds to the deadline. This was no long-standing left-wing conspiracy. He had to "max out" his credit card to get the campaign started and while he has received donations from trade unions such as Unite and communications workers' union the CWU, he appeared to have caught an anti-austerity zeitgeist, with his targets for "crowdfunding" from individuals exceeded. Irrespective of his politics, he does look and sound different from his Oxbridge educated opponents, all of whom were advisers to Labour politicians before becoming MPs. He's a generation older, for a start. At 66, he was a Haringey councillor in the 70s and 80s before the other contenders even went to university. "I have got very few qualifications," he tells me -  he dropped out of North London Polytechnic - "but I have a fascination of reading and read a lot. I spent a lot of time in the school library and the local library and I have this view that everyone I meet knows something I don't know and we can learn from each other." He was weaned on socialist literature. Not for him the Famous Five: "My mother gave me the Ragged Trousered Philanthropists to read." This was Robert Tressell's novel of working class life in Mugsborough - or Hastings - before World War One, and the philanthropists of the title are the people who are all too willing to do back-breaking work for the benefit of their "betters". His maths-teacher mother also gave him the diaries of George Orwell. He spent two years on voluntary service overseas in the Caribbean, but first became active in politics in Shropshire. He founded the Wrekin Young Socialists - the youth wing of the Labour Party -  in the mid-60s. He was the organisation's secretary and regularly attracted 40 to 50 youthful activists to Sunday night meetings. He produced a magazine and organised protests against nuclear weapons and the Vietnam War - perhaps the perfect pedigree for someone who would go on to form the Stop the War coalition with CND stalwart Monsignor Bruce Kent in 2001 - though it's worth remembering that was initially a protest against intervention in Afghanistan, not Iraq. He is not in principle against the deployment of British troops but cannot think of current circumstances where he would do so. He first successfully fought his Islington North in seat in 1983, when the party went down to a disastrous defeat nationally under Michael Foot's leadership on a platform of unilateral disarmament and withdrawal from the EU. Labour had moved decisively to the left in London, too, but with more success. Ken Livingstone was at the head of the then Greater London Council, later abolished by Mrs Thatcher's government. It had been literally a divisive time for his party, with some former cabinet ministers splitting away to form the SDP. Meanwhile some of those on the left tried to unseat MPs they regarded as too right-wing, but who hadn't jumped ship. Corbyn had backed Tony Benn's unsuccessful attempt to become the party's deputy leader - he was very narrowly defeated by Denis Healey. So what had he learned from that period of division? "It taught me in London we achieved a great deal - on transport, on the environment - but it also taught me the formation of the SDP was catastrophic to the electoral chances of Labour. "The Conservative so-called triumph in 1983 owed more to the division of the opposition vote than a move to the left. But it also taught me that you have to take communities with you." There has been a lot of focus on Jeremy Corbyn's disloyalty to his own party. He rebelled on a quarter of all votes during the 2005-2010 government. But I wondered why he had stayed loyal to Labour rather than moving to any of a myriad of parties to its Left when some of the policies he held dear - on nuclear weapons and re-nationalisation - had been ditched? "I want to see a more equal, more just society and the Labour Party has always been the vehicle to achieve that, especially with its organic link to the trade unions. I have argued my case on lots of issues and I think things are changing." And this is his verdict on the 2015 election: "One of the reasons we lost is we weren't offering anything sufficiently different." Well, you certainly couldn't accuse him of not wishing to put that right. He tells an appreciative if not overly enthusiastic audience in Essex that the government's welfare bill "is absolutely brutal" and he will oppose the benefits cap. The cost of welfare is so high, he says, in part because of high rents - which in turn are a symptom of not building enough affordable homes. He rebelled against his party's abstention on the welfare bill while Yvette Cooper and Andy Burnham, despite their doubts, stuck with collective shadow cabinet responsibility. They see that episode as the catalyst for Corbynmania. He rails against tuition fees, but also opposes those in his party who want to see a graduate tax. He said that "wise" old Tony Benn had told him: "you should tax people because they are wealthy, not because they are educated." And he defends his policy of using quantitative easing - whereby the Bank of England would increase the supply of money in the economy - to fund infrastructure projects. His critics say it would push up inflation and erode living standards. He responds: "If you said to people in Germany I have a radical new idea of a National Investment Bank they would just shrug their shoulders and say we are doing that already. What's extreme about that?" And on challenging the agenda of austerity, he says his party has to be bold. The debt ridden government of 1945 - when, after a by-election, even Chelmsford briefly had a Labour MP - "didn't retrench, it invested". There is a feeling, though, that if his campaign isn't running out of steam, he to some extent is - cramming in public meetings, rallies and media appearances. "That's socialism," he says as he is handed, without asking, a glass of water mid-speech as his voice finally falters. He finishes by denouncing the legacy of the Iraq War and promises "whatever the result of the leadership election" that the party's grass roots will be empowered. Mandate for change And he does go on to get a standing ovation. But I ask him how he could be at the head of a shadow cabinet that disagrees with him on fundamental issues - such as the renewal of Trident - or indeed lead a party whose policies in some key respects are very different from his own? "Whoever is elected leader will have a very large mandate from the members and the Parliamentary Labour Party - important as it is - I hope will recognise there is at the very least a mandate for a full debate within the party." Andy Burnham has said he would not be part of a shadow cabinet that didn't commit to renewing Trident. Jeremy Corbyn sees this as a matter of party democracy: "I feel strongly about nuclear weapons. We have to have that debate fairly soon as the government might reach a decision in 2016." Possibly as soon a this month's Labour Party conference. Jeremy Corbyn is the front-runner in the campaign but his critics will say that his leadership would be dominated by those internal debates within Labour that would leave little time - even with the best will in the world - to take the fight to the government. But Corbyn insists "there is a thirst for doing politics differently". We will find out just how many people are drinking in his ideas a week from now.	In the third of a series of in-depth profiles of the four Labour leadership candidates, Iain Watson catches up with Jeremy Corbyn in Essex at the latest of his campaign rallies.
The world's number one aeroplane manufacturer made sales of $94.6bn, down 2%, and net earnings of $4.9bn, 5% lower. It said revenues were likely to slip further in 2017, to between $90.5bn and $92.5bn. But the US company also expects to deliver more commercial aircraft and to improve its earnings per share. "Looking forward, our team is intent on accelerating productivity and programme execution," said chairman and chief executive Dennis Muilenburg. In the period, Boeing made 748 commercial aircraft deliveries, down from 762 in 2015, claiming to have led the market for "the fifth consecutive year". It also delivered fewer military planes - in particular, its new CH-47 Chinook helicopter and its F/A-18 fighter jet - while sales in the division slipped 7%. Revenue also fell in the firm's space and services divisions because of weaker demand for satellites and aircraft modernisation. However, overall group earnings surged 59% in the fourth quarter of the year as demand for the company's commercial planes ticked up. Boeing also projected higher commercial deliveries this year of between 760 and 765 aircraft. The company's shares were up by more than 2% in early trading in New York.	Sales and profits slipped at Boeing last year, driven largely by lower deliveries of its military aircraft.

Dean Owens, from Leith, knew that his great great grandfather Ambrose Salvona was buried somewhere in Inverness. After telling this to his audience at Perth's Southern Fried Festival, Inverness resident Judi Menabney came forward and offered to find the grave. Salvona's resting place has since been found in Tomnahurich Cemetery. Owens' research of his family tree influenced the writing of Dora, a track on his Nashville-recorded album Into the Sea. The song is about his grandmother, Dora Salvona Owens, who grew up in a circus that Salvona started in Scotland. Salvona was thought to have arrived in Scotland from Italy in the company of a dancing bear, sometime in the late 19th Century. Owens' lyrics of the song include the lines: "Somewhere way back there's a lion tamer/Ambrose and his dancing bear/He's buried in the Highlands/but we're not sure where." Ms Menabney works for High Life Highland, an organisation that runs archives, registration and family history services on Highland Council's behalf. With help from her colleagues at the Highland Archive and Registration Centre in Inverness she was able to find the grave in one of the city's largest cemeteries. Family historian Anne Fraser said: "It was great fun investigating Ambrose's story. "He turns out to have been a very colourful character - which may not be a surprise - but we have also finished up raising as many questions as we've answered." The staff at the centre found out that Salvona was married twice and was the father of at least 10 children. He was 80 when he first arrived in Inverness and was, at the end of his life at the age of 88, a resident of a poor house that later became Hilton Hospital and is today a block of flats. Salvona appears to been a popular figure in the Highland town. A procession of people carried his body to a prominent position at Tomnahurich following his death on 13 October 1917. The inscription on the gravestone acknowledges his career as a lion tamer. Owens said: "I can't believe the final resting place of my great great grandfather has been found. "I'm very grateful to Judi, Anne and their colleagues for all the work they've put into discovering his story. "I'm delighted they want to use it and my song Dora - which started the search - in their own presentations." The singer added: "You really don't know what's up there, way up in the family tree. And maybe there's another song in that."	A singer-songwriter has tracked down the grave of a circus lion tamer ancestor with help from an audience member at one of his gigs.
A yellow "be aware" warning has been issued for late Thursday into Friday for the Western and Northern Isles, Highlands and Argyll. The warning also applies to parts of Moray and Aberdeenshire. Earlier this year the Met Office asked the public for suggestions for names for storms. Storm Abigail could bring gusts of 60 to 70mph, potentially rising to speeds of up to 80mph in exposed areas. The warning is in place from 18:00 on Thursday until 14:00 on Friday. In its warning, the Met Office said: "The public should be aware of the risk of disruption to transport. In addition, large waves may give rise to local over-topping along some coasts. "A vigorous depression is expected to pass just to the northwest of Scotland on Thursday night bringing a swathe of very strong winds on its eastern and southern flanks. "There remains some uncertainty regarding the exact extent and timing of strongest winds and the extent of impacts and this warning will be kept under review." Sea swell charts produced by South Devon-based surfing website Magicseaweed.com suggest swell reaching heights of 10-11.5m (36-38ft) on Friday. Meteorologist Dr Eddy Graham, who lectures at Lews Castle College UHI in Stornoway in Lewis, said people should stay indoors if the weather deteriorates. He said: "The Met Office have issued the first high wind warning of the season for this Thursday and Friday for most of northern and western Scotland. "Winds are expected to reach over 70mph, possibly touching 80mph in the strongest gusts. Winds of these speeds are dangerous when outdoors - stay safely indoors when conditions deteriorate."	Storm Abigail, the first storm to be officially named by the Met Office, is set to bring winds of up to 80mph to parts of Scotland later this week.
Heydrich - one of the architects of the Final Solution when he was governor of occupied Bohemia - was assassinated by British-trained Czech and Slovak troops in May 1942. It was an operation which was so audacious in its planning and execution that it inspired John Martin from Mold, Flintshire, to research the topic for more than 40 years. He interviewed Heydrich's son, and descendants of the Special Operations Executive hit-team which killed him, as part of a book which has now been made into a film. Anthropoid, named after the mission's codename, has just gone on general release. It stars actors Cillian Murphy and Fifty Shades of Grey star Jamie Dornan who portrays a Czech resistance fighter. Mr Martin, who is an extra in the film, said: "Not many people have heard of Anthropoid, partly because it was earlier on in the war, and partly because afterwards Britain's role was played down by the Soviets. "It took me until after the fall of the Iron Curtain to be able to get into Prague and properly investigate what happened." Born in 1904, Reinhard Heydrich was a decorated German naval officer in the Weimar Republic. During the rise of the Nazis he progressed quickly to head several branches of the Nazi secret police, including the Gestapo and SD, and was a key figure in both 'The Night of The Long Knives' and 'Kristallnacht'. As Nazi head in occupied Czechoslovakia, he was instructed to improve the productivity of the region's flagging munitions and automobile factories. It was a role which he performed so successfully that the Allies determined he must be removed. Mr Martin said: "Before Heydrich's appointment the Czech Resistance had been quite successful in reducing productivity by as much as a third through go-slows. "Heydrich introduced a policy he called 'Sugar and Whip', whereby those who cooperated gained extra rations and clothing, whilst those who didn't were kidnapped, tortured and killed. "In one way the fact he rewarded people might be seen as a humanising feature, but I think it makes him all the more chilling. "For him, it wasn't about the violence, he'd do whatever it took to achieve the Nazis' ultimate ambitions." In December 1941 the SOE assassination squad of Josef Gabcik and Jan Kubis was parachuted into Bohemia from an RAF Halifax bomber. They spent six months undercover planning their assault, before finally ambushing Heydrich on a blind hairpin bend on the Prague to Dresden road on 27 May 1942. Heydrich died of his injuries a week later, and although the Nazis reaped devastating revenge, Mr Martin contends it was still a worthwhile mission. Mr Martin said: "Hitler personally ordered the levelling of two villages - Lidice and LeÅ¾Ã¡ky - where all the men over 16 were shot and all the women transported to concentration camps. "The ordinary population paid a terrible price for what was essentially an economic and military attack. Yet you can see in Hitler's response just what a devastating blow the assassination was. "Hitler was furious at the arrogance which led Heydrich to travel in an unguarded open top car, and later he'd say that the loss of Heydrich was the beginning of the end in the battle for the Eastern Front." Mr Martin currently works on cruise ships, where he gives both comedy performances and history lectures on Heydrich. "It's a strange life for me," he said. "One night I'll be telling jokes, and the next afternoon I'm lecturing on the holocaust. "Some comedians can make jokes about things like that, but I have to keep the two completely separate. "I'm delighted that my book's been made into a film. I can tell people about Heydrich, but it's only now they'll see him on the screen, that his true horror will really sink in."	Nicknamed "The Hangman of Prague", SS general Reinhard Heydrich was a man even Hitler himself feared as "the man with an iron heart".
Chastain, who is now retired from the sport, said she hoped it would help "change things for the positive". She joins a number of sporting figures helping to research long-term effects of concussion on competitors in sports. CTE, a degenerative disease, has been found in athletes with a history of repetitive brain trauma. Chastain, 47, announced on Thursday she would be donating her brain to Boston University, which is leading studies into the effects of multiple concussions and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). "It's scary to think about all the heading and potential concussions that were never diagnosed in my life, but it's better to know," she said, speculating about her own experience of head injury during her football career. CTE is associated with symptoms such as memory loss, depression and progressive dementia. No female athletes have been found to have suffered from CTE, the New York Times reports, though this may be because the sample size is too small. The disease has been found in a number of male sports stars - including many former American football players. CTE cases can only be diagnosed after examination of the brain post-mortem. Chastain's decision follows that of her team mate, Cindy Parlow Cone, who has also decided to donate her brain. Both women have been calling on football regulators to introduce regulation preventing children under the age of 14 from heading the ball. Research into CTE has thrown the spotlight on several sports, including American football, horse-racing and rugby in recent months. A Hollywood film about the effects of concussion on National Football League stars was released last year, starring Will Smith. In February, it was revealed Ken Stabler, one of the most celebrated quarterbacks of all time, had been suffering from the disease. Chastain became well known for scoring America's winning goal in a penalty shoot-out against China in the final of the 1999 Women's World Cup. Images of the football star kneeling on the pitch in her black sports bra, fists clenched, swept around the world, becoming an iconic image for women's football.	US football star Brandi Chastain, who shot to fame in the 1999 Women's World Cup, has pledged to donate her brain to the Concussion Legacy Foundation.
The Twickenham crowd watched England run in three tries within eight second-half minutes as the home side ran out comprehensive 38-21 winners. Their previous biggest win over New Zealand was 13-0 at Twickenham in January 1936, while the most points they had ever registered against the All Blacks was the 31 they scored at the same venue in November 2002. Only once in 498 Tests had New Zealand been beaten by a bigger margin (28-7). So, what have the pundits got to say about an England victory which very few saw coming? "I can probably see this being maybe the greatest ever England victory, ever, at Twickenham. Nothing is springing to mind where they have annihilated the world's best team as they have today. "I think I have been to every single England game at Twickenham since I was 14. This was by far the best game I've seen. "It's the best performance by an England side considering the opposition and considering what this team has been through, particularly over the last two weeks. This was absolutely magnificent. "Not only has this got to be the greatest game I've seen England play at Twickenham, we've got to put this among one of the world's greatest upsets, maybe even in any sport. Media playback is not supported on this device "It was an absolutely astonishing performance to win by 17 points. England harried, hounded and were just relentless. They said to New Zealand 'We will tackle you wherever you go and then we'll pinch the ball and see if we can live off scraps'. New Zealand cracked. "It has been England's day - this is not about today not being New Zealand's day. England have put New Zealand under pressure and they defended not only for their lives but for the 80,000 people inside Twickenham and the millions watching at home. It has been relentless and they gave everything, epitomised by man of the match Tom Wood. "People stepped up. Individuals stepped up one to 15, not just the odd player, particularly in that second half. It was wave after wave of England, whether it was defence or attack. That was the difference." Matt Dawson was speaking on BBC Radio 5 live. "It was a fantastic Test match played with great energy. This England team has had a lot of flak over the past couple of weeks and they've got a lot of pride back in the shirt. "The crowd just buzzed off it and it was wonderful to be here. "What I liked about the start was that when England walked on the field there wasn't a lot of song and dance about it, they knew they had to do a job and they took the game to New Zealand. "I said beforehand, if you're going to beat the best teams in the world, indeed become the best in the world, you've got to have self-belief and for me they played with that self-belief today. They took the game to New Zealand and deserved the victory. Media playback is not supported on this device "Looking at the first half, New Zealand will rue a couple of those missed penalties but psychologically England just built it and built it. "There was still room to improve - Ashton missed an opportunity in the corner, Tuilagi forced the ball - but this team today gelled. They got opportunities and took them - to me that's what Test match rugby is about. "It's very easy to look back at the past but England's 31-28 win against the All Blacks in 2002 was the day we actually said 'we are the top team in the world'. It was a massive transformation from which England then built for the next few years. "Hopefully we'll look back at this day not just as a great day for English rugby, but the day this team really grew up." Josh Lewsey was speaking on BBC Three. "Absolutely unbelievable. Not just to get the victory, but the best victory England have ever had against the All Blacks. No-one saw it coming, but maybe this England team did. "They played absolutely magnificently well, not just scoring penalties to build the score in the first half, but try after try in the second half. It was quite extraordinary. "Chris Robshaw was a hero - he deserves all the credit he will get. In the same way England were lambasted in defeat, when they play well - which they did, they were heroic - they should take a huge round of applause. "They got themselves 15-0 up and then conceded two soft tries, but the way they came back at New Zealand was so impressive. "The All Blacks looked shell-shocked at the end." Lawrence Dallaglio was speaking on BBC Three "It was a fantastic win. It was a great to be there, one of best games I ever seen at Twickenham. "It was the All Blacks against England who were coming off two average defeats. The scoreline reflected the performance. It was a great day for England. "I think because it was the last of the games in the series and what happened in the match means it was a David versus Goliath effort. "England got stuck into New Zealand early on and they were rattled. A key point was when Conrad Smith came flying out and England went through. "New Zealand never recovered from that. It was a great, great victory for England." Sir Clive Woodward was speaking to BBC Radio 5 live's Sportsweek	England's record-breaking win over New Zealand even had All Blacks coach Steve Hansen praising Stuart Lancaster's side.

Elizabeth Bowe, 50, was found badly injured in Bobby Jones Place in St Andrews at about 21:00 on Saturday 17 September. She was taken to Ninewells Hospital in Dundee but she died three days later. Her brother Charles Gordon, 51, appeared at Dundee Sheriff Court on Tuesday facing a single charge of murder. He made no plea or declaration and was remanded in custody. The police were called out to Ms Bowe's home before the incident. The Police Investigations and Review Commissioner's (PIRC) investigation was ordered by the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS). A spokesman for the PIRC said: "The investigation will focus on the initial police response leading up to the incident. "A report on the Commissioner's findings will be submitted to the COPFS in due course."	The police watchdog has launched an investigation following the death of a 50-year-old woman.
Sheikh Obeikan, who was an adviser to the royal cabinet, opposed moves to relax gender segregation. The dismissal comes shortly after Sheikh Obeikan attacked plans by "influential people to corrupt Muslim society by trying to change the natural status of women". Saudi officials did not give a reason for Sheikh Obeikan's departure. His recent comments were taken to be an attack on tentative steps towards relaxing some stricter interpretations of Saudi law. King Abdullah has promised women the right to vote in future elections, has opened the country's first co-educational university and introduced measures against domestic violence. The head of Saudi Arabia's religious police, the "mutawa", was also replaced in January, with the new head widely seen as more moderate than his predecessor. Sheikh Obeikan achieved a degree of notoriety several years ago with a decree suggesting that unrelated Saudi men and women could mix so long as the man drank the woman's breast milk, thus creating a maternal bond between them.	Saudi King Abdullah has sacked one of his most hardline advisers, Sheikh Abdelmohsen al-Obeikan.
But in April - before the EU referendum - the then home secretary gave a speech warning of the implications of a vote to leave the EU. Here's how some of the key quotes compare: April 2016: "So, if we do vote to leave the European Union, we risk bringing the development of the single market to a halt, we risk a loss of investors and businesses to remaining EU member states driven by discriminatory EU policies, and we risk going backwards when it comes to international trade. "But the big question is whether, in the event of Brexit, we would be able to negotiate a new free trade agreement with the EU and on what terms." January 2017: "I respect the position taken by European leaders who have been clear about their position, just as I am clear about mine. So an important part of the new strategic partnership we seek with the EU will be the pursuit of the greatest possible access to the single market, on a fully reciprocal basis, through a comprehensive free trade agreement." April 2016: "The reality is that we do not know on what terms we would win access to the single market. We do know that in a negotiation we would need to make concessions in order to access it, and those concessions could well be about accepting EU regulations, over which we would have no say, making financial contributions, just as we do now, accepting free movement rules, just as we do now, or quite possibly all three combined. "It is not clear why other EU member states would give Britain a better deal than they themselves enjoy." January 2017: "If we were excluded from accessing the single market, we would be free to change the basis of Britain's economic model. "But for the EU, it would mean new barriers to trade with one of the biggest economies in the world. It would jeopardise investments in Britain by EU companies worth more than half a trillion pounds... and I do not believe that the EU's leaders will seriously tell German exporters, French farmers, Spanish fishermen, the young unemployed of the eurozone, and millions of others, that they want to make them poorer, just to punish Britain and make a political point." April 2016: "It is tempting to look at developing countries' economies, with their high growth rates, and see them as an alternative to trade with Europe. But just look at the reality of our trading relationship with China - with its dumping policies, protective tariffs and industrial-scale industrial espionage. And look at the figures. We export more to Ireland than we do to China, almost twice as much to Belgium as we do to India, and nearly three times as much to Sweden as we do to Brazil. It is not realistic to think we could just replace European trade with these new markets." "And while we could certainly negotiate our own trade agreements, there would be no guarantee that they would be on terms as good as those we enjoy now. There would also be a considerable opportunity cost given the need to replace the existing agreements - not least with the EU itself - that we would have torn up as a consequence of our departure." January 2017: "We want to get out into the wider world, to trade and do business all around the globe. Countries including China, Brazil, and the Gulf States have already expressed their interest in striking trade deals with us." April 2016 (responding to a question from the BBC): "What matters is that we have brought about changes in the free movement rules as a result of the negotiation." January 2017: "As home secretary for six years, I know that you cannot control immigration overall when there is free movement to Britain from Europe." April 2016: "With no agreement, we know that WTO rules would oblige the EU to charge 10% tariffs on UK car exports, in line with the tariffs they impose on Japan and the United States. They would be required to do the same for all other goods upon which they impose tariffs.  Not all of these tariffs are as high as 10%, but some are considerably higher." January 2017: "And while I am confident that this scenario need never arise - while I am sure a positive agreement can be reached - I am equally clear that no deal for Britain is better than a bad deal for Britain. "Because we would still be able to trade with Europe. We would be free to strike trade deals across the world. And we would have the freedom to set the competitive tax rates and embrace the policies that would attract the world's best companies and biggest investors to Britain."	Theresa May has said the UK will emerge from Brexit as a "great, global trading nation", becoming "safer, more secure and more prosperous".
It was one of several measures European and African leaders agreed to reduce the flow of people into Europe. The leaders said their aim was to "address the root causes of migration". The Europe-Africa meeting was planned after around 800 migrants died when their boat sank off Libya in April. Senegal's President Macky Sall, who currently heads the West African regional group Ecowas, told journalists on the sidelines of the summit that the money pledged was "not enough for the whole of Africa". Later, at the closing press conference, he said he was pleased with the trust fund, but said he would like to see it "more generously financed". Niger's President Mahamadou Issoufou echoed the Senegalese president's sentiments and added that "reform of global governance" was also needed, to make world trade fairer, Reuters news agency reports. While Somalia's Prime Minister Omar Abdirashidali Sharmatke told the BBC:  "What Africa needs today is not charity, but investment." EU Council President Donald Tusk said the summit had agreed "a long list of very concrete actions to be implemented by the end of 2016". These include setting up a joint European and African team in Niger to tackle people smuggling and increasing the number of visas available to students and researchers. "We are under no illusions that we can improve the situation overnight but we are committed to giving people alternatives to risking their lives," Mr Tusk said. The European trust fund is supposed to "foster stability... and to contribute to better migration management", according to a European Union statement. It is also aimed at "promoting economic... opportunities, security and development" in the 23 African countries named which, along with Senegal, include Nigeria, Eritrea and Libya. The money will be spent on: "Financial aid to accept deportation of thousands" declares Algerian daily El-Khabar, before quoting human rights groups warning that Europe was "forcing African countries to play the role of policeman". However, Germany's tabloid Bild asks: "Why is Chancellor Merkel negotiating with Africa's despots?" in its account of the "tricky Valletta summit". Similarly, the Sueddeutsche Zeitung says the EU's offer of money for fewer refugees from Africa was making critics "accuse the EU of showing its real values by cooperating with unjust regimes". In neighbouring France, Le Figaro urges President Francois Hollande to "have the courage" to drastically cut all kinds of aid for migrants. "In the short term, what is he waiting for to close the Calais 'jungle'... and change the policy against clandestine immigration?" In Russia, state-controlled Channel One TV describes the summit as "another attempt by Europe to stop the chaos", noting that "whilst Europe and Africa are bargaining with each other, thousands are embarking on fatal trips in the Mediterranean". The $1.9bn fund is in addition to the $20bn the EU already spends on development assistance in Africa every year, Mr Tusk said. The fund is also supposed to be boosted by contributions by individual member states, but only a small amount had been pledged. The UN says some 150,000 people from African countries such as Eritrea, Nigeria and Somalia have made the dangerous journey across the Mediterranean. But this has been dwarfed by the arrival of some 650,000 people - mostly Syrians - via Turkey and Greece. There have been more than 3,000 deaths as people try to make the crossing. BBC world affairs reporter Richard Galpin says the crisis has evolved so quickly this year that European leaders have been struggling to keep up and formulate any coherent policies.	The $1.9bn (£1.2bn) European fund to tackle African migration is not sufficient, several African leaders have said after crisis talks with their European counterparts.
Now the business organisation, the CBI, has become the latest civil society group to argue that a restructure is required. This week, the independent unionist MLA John McCallister has tabled a bill in the assembly that proposes big changes to the workings of the devolved parliament and government. The stalled Stormont House Agreement outlined plans for a formal opposition. But Mr McCallister's Assembly and Executive Reform Bill goes much further. He argues that his plans would help to move politics in Northern Ireland away from tribal divisions. "The public mood out there is that people desperately want to see this place working and functional - being about evidence-based policy making," he says. "Being able to change the government is a fundamental right of democracy." Under his plans, parties would have to gain 18 or more seats to be automatically entitled to enter the executive. They would negotiate with each other to agree a Programme for Government before taking up ministerial positions. Any party with fewer than 18 seats would not be excluded from the executive, as they could be included on the basis of the negotiations. But if a party did not agree with the Programme for Government, they would go into an enhanced opposition. First Minister's Questions in the assembly would work more like Prime Minister's Questions at Westminster. There would be a leader and deputy leader of the opposition, likely to be the leaders of the two largest non-executive parties. At least 15 days a year would be set aside for opposition business. Smaller parties could have a bigger say. In the Irish parliament, or DÃ¡il, independents have signed up to a technical group to get improved speaking rights. The Stormont bill proposes a similar system in Northern Ireland, suggesting that six or more MLAs could form a group that would be represented on the committee that decides assembly business. At the moment, 89 out of the 108 MLAs are in the parties that make up the executive. Queen's University Belfast professor Yvonne Galligan, who has carried out studies that have compared democratic institutions, says having an opposition makes more sense to voters. "The government and opposition model is one which is very familiar to people on these islands," she says. "I think that allows people to clearly distinguish between parties and political platforms. "A strong parliament and a strong opposition would help to shore up people's confidence in our democratic institutions." When it comes to critiques of the parliamentary system, Stormont is not alone. Mary Fee MSP, a member of Scottish Labour's shadow cabinet, told me that the Scottish Parliament's means of holding government to account had flaws. She says parliamentary committees should be fewer in number, but have more members, and be given more time to scrutinise legislation. "Committee members should take off their party hats when they go into committee," she says. "That is something that has dogged us. With a majority government, members of the governing party will more often toe the party line and not scrutinise the government." Besides government and opposition, there are other significant measures in Mr McCallister's bill. It would abolish community designation, the system by which MLAs must register as unionist, nationalist, or "other". Currently, 30 signatures on a "petition of concern" will trigger a cross-community vote, under which a majority of unionists and nationalists are necessary for a motion to pass. The bill would replace petitions of concern with another minority protection mechanism - 30 signatures from three parties or groups would be needed to require a motion or bill to have a "weighted majority" - 60% would be the threshold for success. There would also be a new rule for ministers. Collective cabinet responsibility would be written into the ministerial code, in an attempt to stop inter-executive sniping. And instead of having a deputy first minister, there would be two first ministers. Mr McCallister says he has had indications from many of the Stormont parties that they could sign up to "much" of the bill. He acknowledges that some parties may have issues with the proposals to have two first ministers and to abolish community designation. However, the South Down MLA claims that his bill is a "carefully put together package of something which will work and deliver a much more functional assembly and executive". Whether it is passed, in part or in full, will depend on what the assembly's bigger parties make of it. MLAs may hold their first debate on the bill next month. The View is broadcast on BBC One Northern Ireland at 22:35 on Thursday, and is available to watch afterwards on the iPlayer.	"Dysfunctional", "not fit for purpose", "in urgent need of reform" - these are just some of the phrases that politicians themselves have been using about the Stormont system.
Kara McCullough, a scientist at the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission, appeared to link healthcare to employment. But the beauty queen, 25, faced a backlash on social media. It comes as the Trump administration battles to overturn Obamacare, which aimed to extend insurance coverage to the 15% of Americans who lack it. Earlier this month the lower chamber of the US Congress passed a new healthcare act that Democrats say will leave millions uninsured. However, Republicans in the Senate have indicated they will cast it aside and write a new law. Asked during Sunday's pageant in Las Vegas whether healthcare was a privilege or a right, Miss McCullough said: "I'm definitely going to say it's a privilege." She added: "As a government employee, I'm granted healthcare and I see first hand that for one to have healthcare, you need to have jobs. "We need to continue to cultivate this environment that we're given the opportunity to have healthcare as well as jobs to all American citizens worldwide." Her remarks divided liberal-minded and conservative-minded viewers. Some were quick to criticise her stance. Miss McCullough - who was born in Italy and was representing Washington DC - was also asked if she considered herself to be a feminist but said she preferred the term "equalism" and said men and women had equal opportunity in US workplaces. "I don't really want to consider myself - try not to consider myself like this die-hard, you know, like, 'Oh, I don't really care about men'," said the contestant, who says she wants to see more women employed in government science roles. Some people on social media supported her views. Obamacare has been opposed by Republicans since it was first proposed in 2009. Republicans say the law imposes too many costs on business and describe it as a "job killer", although the number of jobs in the healthcare sector has risen since it was introduced. Opponents have also decried it as an unwarranted intrusion into the affairs of private businesses and individuals.	The new Miss USA beauty pageant winner has sparked controversy by declaring that healthcare was a "privilege", not a right.
Media playback is not supported on this device The Reds drew 2-2 at the Stadium of Light, less than 44 hours after beating title rivals Manchester City. "I told the players if nobody wanted to play I would never speak about it and not tell anyone, but nobody came. That was a good thing," said Klopp. Match of the Day pundit Martin Keown said: "Klopp looked tired himself." The draw left Liverpool five points behind leaders Chelsea, who visit Tottenham on Wednesday (20:00 GMT). Former Arsenal defender Keown said: "The high-intensity game has taken it out of them but it has been a good half of the season for them." Klopp said he "does not know exactly what I saw" during the draw at the Stadium of Light. Daniel Sturridge and Sadio Mane twice put the Reds ahead, but two Jermain Defoe penalties pegged them back. "I'm not able to explain it," said Klopp. "We can play better football but I'm not sure if you can play better with that break." Klopp made just one change to his starting XI, with forward Sturridge coming in for injured midfielder Jordan Henderson in an altered formation. Liverpool covered a total of 118.63km as a team, outrunning Sunderland, who clocked up 115.89km. That is in keeping with their performances over the rest of the festive period, during which they ran 116.87km in beating Manchester City and 118.94km in their 4-1 win over Stoke on 27 December. Media playback is not supported on this device Sunderland manager David Moyes suggested Klopp would have been widely praised had he been responsible for the home side's tactics. Klopp described the Black Cats as "the most defensive team I ever saw" after his side won the reverse fixture at Anfield 2-0 in November. "Maybe if I was a German manager, you might praise that, actually," said Moyes. "If I had been German, you might have been saying, 'great, you're doing something different'." England striker Sturridge was forced off 10 minutes from full-time on his first Premier League start since October. However, Klopp is hopeful the 27-year-old, who has scored six goals in 14 club appearances this season, will be back sooner rather than later. "He got a knock on his right ankle. I don't think it's too bad," said Klopp. Sturridge has had a series of injuries since signing from Chelsea in January 2013, including hip and thigh problems.	Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp says he gave his players the chance to opt out of Monday's match at Sunderland if they were too tired - but nobody wanted to.
Four officers were injured when the Met's Flying Squad swooped on the men in Piccadilly at 11:25 BST. A Taser was discharged several times and the policemen were hurt as the men tried to escape on mopeds. Four men have been arrested and are being held at London police stations. A Met Police spokesman said three officers suffered minor injuries and the fourth is in hospital in a serious condition. Store owner Avi Reed said the gang smashed a glass cabinet, causing more than Â£300,000 of damage, Mr Reed said police contacted them at the Chronext store earlier to warn them that there might be a robbery, and the shop was closed to protect customers. He said: "At about 11:30 we saw three guys, they had helmets on. One tried to smash the door with a hammer. The glass didn't break as it's protected but he managed to get in. "Another guy had an axe and managed to smash a cabinet, while the other stayed on the motorbike. They caused enormous damage." Mr Reed praised the actions of the "amazing" police. Det Supt Craig Turner, said: "Our officers are absolutely committed to keeping London safe and target the criminals who pose a danger to Londoners and our city businesses day in, day out. "They know that this work carries with it very real risks and dangers but take this in their stride as part of serving the public. "However, today's events highlight how the reckless behaviour of those determined to evade justice, heedless of the consequences, can have a real impact on all those involved." Piccadilly was closed eastbound at Hyde Park Corner for about six hours while investigations were carried out.	A moped gang armed with knives and an axe has been intercepted by police in a "terrifying" attempt to rob a luxury watch store in central London.
With a television audience of 110 million, it's one of the biggest platforms in the world - and Gaga has been putting in the hours to ensure her set is suitably spectacular. "We were [rehearsing] in the tent for about a week and a half, then we had to move to bigger studios in Hollywood where we are working on the rest of the show," she told Houston radio station Mix 96.5. "And then we will send that equipment to Houston where we will finish rehearsals. Fans can expect a performance that spans my career so far." She has a high standard to live up to - notably Prince's show in 2007, which took place in the middle of a Miami thunderstorm and is widely accepted as the greatest performance in the event's history, if not Prince's career. Here are some of the other most memorable - and surprising - moments from the last 30 years. Super Bowl performers get a very strict 12-minute time limit, so most performers cram their set with as much music as possible. Not Michael Jackson. After shooting onto the stage at the Pasadena Rose Bowl, he stood completely still, staring at the world for a full 90 seconds. Ninety. It was a master class in ratcheting expectation to a fever pitch. And the screams when he launched into Jam (not one of his best songs) proved he knew what he was doing. Brilliantly, Jackson staged this entire performance while wearing a jacket it looked like he'd borrowed from Muammar Gaddafi. Beat that, Gaga. Baby, he was born to run... and slide on his knees... and crotch slam a TV camera. In his autobiography, The Boss explains the incident like this: "Too much adrenalin, a late drop, too much speed, here I come, Mikeâ€¦ BOOM! "And I'm onto his camera, the lens implanted into my chest with one leg off the stage. I use his camera to push myself back up andâ€¦ BLAM! BORN TO RUN!" It led to the memorable headline: "America Attacked by Bruce Springsteen's crotch" - but it didn't stop the star delivering one of the most powerful and energetic Super Bowl shows in recent history. Even if they were fined for over-running by 40 seconds. Coldplay were the headline act at last year's Super Bowl in Santa Clara - but someone forgot to tell Beyonce. She only performed one song, Formation, underscoring its message of black pride and power with back-up dancers dressed in leather body suits and black berets reminiscent of the Black Panthers movement. Some of her dancers were even pictured holding up a sign declaring "Justice 4 Mario Woods" - a 26-year-old black man who was shot dead by armed police in San Francisco two months earlier. The performance heralded the arrival of her unapologetically political album, Lemonade, later in the year. You can't out-diva Diana, something she was determined to prove when she strode onto the pitch in Tempe, Arizona, for Super Bowl XXX. She raced through 10 songs and four costume changes in 12 minutes, then jumped into a helicopter and fled the stadium. Which is one way to beat the post-game traffic. For the first few decades, the Super Bowl half-time performance featured marching bands, drill teams and Disney's mouseketeers. 1987's show was altogether more bizarre. A magician named "Elvis Presto" burst out of a jukebox, before performing a series of conjuring tricks, aided by 2,000 part-time dancers, 102 custom Harley Davidson motorcycles and some of rock's biggest classics. At the culmination of the show, the "Prince of Prestidigitation" performed an interactive magic trick ("pick a card, concentrate real hard") while viewers at home watched through 3D glasses. It was cheesier than a wheel of brie - and prompted the NFL to adopt a more modern approach. She arrived on a mechanical tiger, and departed on a shooting star - but Katy Perry couldn't compete with the infamous "left shark". He was one of two foam-suited dancers flanking Katy while she performed Teenage Dream. While the one on the right was forgettable, the left shark flailed around in a desperate attempt to remember his dance moves. It quickly became a viral sensation, spawning a whole range of merchandise from the ever-savvy pop star. And when the half-time show was nominated for an Emmy, Katy made sure to thank her faithful friend. Poor old Janet Jackson. She was at the end of a triumphant, hit-laden medley when Justin Timberlake ripped the front off her bodice, revealing a heavily-bejewelled superboob. Few ever believed that the "wardrobe malfunction" was indeed a malfunction - but if you look at the photographs taken immediately after the event, Jackson appears mortified (notably, these were not the pictures printed by the press). Nonetheless, America went apoplectic. The Federal Complaints Commission reportedly got more than 200,000 complaints, while Janet was blacklisted by MTV and radio. Her career never fully recovered. But there is a bright side to this story. A PayPal employee called Jawed Karim missed the half-time show and grew frustrated that he couldn't watch the incident online. In response, he and his friends Steve Chen and Chad Hurley began coding a website where people could upload their own content. That site would end up being YouTube.

Born in Bradford, Appleyard did not make his first-class debut until he was 27, but took 200 wickets in his first season in 1951. He made his Test debut in 1954 and had match figures of 7-123 in a victory over Pakistan at Trent Bridge. Appleyard retired from playing in 1958 and went on to serve a two-year term as club president between 2006 and 2008. During his career, he took 642 wickets at an average of 15.42 for Yorkshire, and 31 in nine Tests for England. Appleyard was named as one of  Wisden's cricketers of the year in 1952 and appointed an MBE in 2007.	Former Yorkshire and England off-spinner Bob Appleyard MBE has died at the age of 90.
The announcement follows last week's warning that a vast area of China would be badly hit by pollution. Beijing saw its second red alert over the weekend. The latest wave of alerts includes the industrial port Tianjin. Red alerts trigger advisories for people to stay inside, schools to stop classes, and restrict vehicle use. An environmental ministry statement issued on  Wednesday night said the 10 cities with red alerts include Tianjin as well as smaller surrounding cities Puyang, Xinxiang, Dezhou, Handan, Xintai, Langfang, Hengshui, Xinji and Anyang. They are among 30 cities including Beijing seeing "severe pollution". Another 20 cities have "heavy pollution". The latest news was met with resignation, and even some jokes, by Chinese netizens who have endured bad air quality levels in recent weeks. On Wednesday, images of  a purple-tinged sunset in Nanjing spread across social media with many users attributing it to the pollution in the city. "New type of haze: grape flavoured," joked Weibo user Chenyingshisupoman. Another Weibo user Diliutianmaoxianjia said sarcastically: "Compared to the heavy smog of Beijing, the strong smog of Hebei, and damp heat of Shanghai, I prefer the colours of Nanjing's smog... it is durable and refreshing... once you breathe it in it sticks to your heart." Beijing's second red alert ended on Tuesday night. The ministry said the capital's air quality was "slowly improving". But some parts of neighbouring Henan and Hebei regions were still seeing heavy pollution, with levels of the PM2.5 pollutant surpassing 300 mg per cubic metre - the hazardous level in China. China has seen extremely high levels of air pollution in recent years, particularly in the coal-reliant north east, the industrial heart of the country. Following criticism that authorities were not doing enough to protect citizens' health, the government has stepped up in issuing health advisories and promised to take action to address pollution.	Hazardous smog blanketing China's north-east has sparked more red alerts, with authorities advising residents in 10 cities to stay indoors.
Vardy, 29, has not scored for the champions since 10 September - a run of 14 games - but netted in England's 2-2 friendly draw with Spain last week. His form is in stark contrast to a year ago, when he scored for a record 11th Premier League game in a row. "He has restarted and is very close to scoring," said Ranieri. "He has started to also score in training, and that is good news because also, in the training, he didn't score so well." Vardy has scored twice in the league this season compared with 13 at the same stage in 2015-16. He finished last season with 28 goals in 48 appearances for club and country. Since his last club goal, the Foxes have slipped to 14th in the table with just two wins in nine matches. Ranieri believes Vardy and team-mate Riyad Mahrez no longer boast the "surprise" factor that worked in their favour last season. The Italian said: "That is the big problem. Jamie is always normal, the same last season. You don't see him nervous or frustrated. "But sooner or later Vardy will come back. I speak every day with him. He is very calm, very concentrated in his job, to work for the team." Leicester, who have qualified from their Champions League group with a game to spare, host Middlesbrough in the Premier League on Saturday (15:00 GMT).	Leicester boss Claudio Ranieri has backed Jamie Vardy to end his goal drought, but revealed the striker has even struggled to score in training.
In his first prime-time speech on a specific policy issue, the Republican leader will address the nation at 21:00 local time (01:00 GMT). He said he had reached a decision after reviewing war options with his national security team at Camp David. Mr Trump once called for a full US pullout from Afghanistan. He announced a strategic review soon after taking office in January. So what can the president do when he addresses the nation? Option 1: He could pull out all 8,400 US troops and let the Afghans get on with it. That could be popular at home and would be consistent with what Donald Trump has previously said. But it would leave a dangerous vacuum to be filled not just by Afghan rebels, but also by embryonic Islamic State affiliates which are taking hold in the east of the country. Option 2: He could pull out a large number of US troops and deploy private contractors to continue the work of advising and assisting the Afghan military, in effect outsourcing the job. That's not likely to be popular with the Afghan government, and Washington would still get the blame if things did not work out. Option 3: And this seems the more likely one. He could send more troops (up to 4,000 the best guess) to bolster the training of more Afghan security forces and perhaps add to the American special forces who are involved in the fight to expel IS related groups. Whatever he decides, analysts will be looking for something that amounts to a strategy and not just a change in tactics and that will probably have to involve drawing other countries in the region, such as Pakistan and Russia, into the discussion. He will deliver his first major national security address at a military base next to Arlington National Cemetery, where many of the 2,200 US troops who have died fighting over 16 years of war in Afghanistan are buried. Mr Trump is also expected to outline a more aggressive US counter-terrorism policy for Afghanistan and Pakistan. Earlier this year, the president empowered Defence Secretary Jim Mattis to set troop levels in Afghanistan. General John Nicholson, the top US military commander in the country, has requested some 4,000 additional US forces. He told Afghan troops at a training base southeast of Kabul on Sunday: "We are with you and we will stay with you." US combat operations against the Taliban officially ended in 2014, but special forces have continued to provide support to Afghan troops. Current US troop numbers in Afghanstan are about 8,400. The Afghan government continues to battle insurgency groups and controls just half of the country. Mr Trump has previously supported pulling troops out of the conflict, which began under President George W Bush in 2001 after the 9/11 attacks. "I took over a mess, and we're going to make it a lot less messy," Mr Trump said when asked about Afghanistan earlier this month. End of Twitter post  by @realDonaldTrump End of Twitter post 2 by @realDonaldTrump "We're not winning," he told advisers in a meeting in July. His defence secretary has argued a US military presence is necessary to fight off threats from Islamist militants. Mr Mattis visited Afghanistan over the weekend, saying he was satisfied with the administration's new strategy. Former White House strategic adviser Steve Bannon had called for the withdrawal of all US forces, arguing the war was unwinnable. But he was fired by the president on Friday.	US President Donald Trump is expected to indicate later that he is sending more troops to Afghanistan, prolonging a war-weary America's longest conflict.
The 79-year-old West Ham chairman was sent a tweet by a prankster, asking to spread awareness of a "missing" Hammers fan. Gold obliged, only for the fan to turn out to be West Ham winger Michail Antonio. Antonio, 25, cost the Hammers £7m when he arrived from Nottingham Forest on transfer deadline day - but he has made just one appearance for Slaven Bilic's team, coming on as a substitute in the 2-1 win at Manchester City on 19 September. Gold has since deleted the tweet, but the prankster has pinned a screen grab to the top of his Twitter timeline. The lesson - think before you retweet.	David Gold thought he was doing a good deed, but instead was found guilty of not recognising one of his own players.

St James' Park and West Ham United's ground were raided in April by HM Revenue and Customs as part of a Â£5m National Insurance fraud investigation. Newcastle's managing director Lee Charnley was among several men arrested and later released without charge. The ban remains in force until a court hearing on 22 June. High Court judge Mr Justice Supperstone imposed the ban after lawyers for Newcastle United applied for a judicial review against HMRC. He directed that any material retained by HMRC must be returned to the club. He also directed that the legal action involving the Magpies, who have just secured promotion to the Premier League, must return to court on 22 June. It is expected the club will then have to show that it has an arguable case to take to a full judicial review hearing. No details of the grounds of the challenge were revealed during Thursday's short court hearing. Lawyers for both the club and HMRC said they could not provide any further information. During the raids HMRC said it had seized business records and financial records as well as computers and mobile phones.	Tax officials have been banned from examining material seized from Newcastle United's ground, following a legal challenge mounted by the club.
Lizzie Mould, from Bristol University, was challenged by Gloucestershire firm Snow Business to come up with a "green" realistic snow for film and television. It took her two years and a "few hundred attempts" but now her new snow liquids are being sold to the industry. Ms Mould, said: "To say that seeing the products on the market is rewarding would be an understatement." The Stroud-based company which specialises in fake snow and ice effects, has previously worked on James Bond film Spectre, Avengers: Age of Ultron and Star Wars VII: The Force Awakens. But in a bid to create a "really good snow effect" which was "robust in different climates", environmentally friendly and would not damage people's skin or leave a residue - they approached the university. "I must have made hundreds of formulations. before we got to where we are today," said Ms Mould, who has now been offered a full-time job with the firm. "The original plan was just to make one fluid but by the end of my project we had two which both worked really well." Recently launched to the industry, Paul Denney, from the company, said as far as they know the new liquids are "the most environmentally friendly falling snow products in the world". "We had looked at developing the product ourselves but the chemistry involved was beyond our capabilities, which is why we approached the University of Bristol," he said. "We weren't totally sure what Lizzie would be able to do, especially as we had a long wish list of characteristics but she's really come up trumps and surpassed all our expectations."	A chemistry student has created "the most environmentally-friendly" fake snow, as part of her research.
It began just before 14:00 GMT at the property in Grove Lane on the outskirts of Elmswell, near Bury St Edmunds. Progress at the scene has been "slow due to the weather conditions", Suffolk Fire and Rescue Service said. Nine crews remained at the property into the evening, removing the thatch and damping down hot spots. At its peak 16 crews attended the blaze. The cause of the fire is not yet known.	A fire has ripped through the first floor of a thatched house in a Suffolk village.
United, who registered only one shot on target, fell behind when Alejandro Dominguez diverted home Giannis Maniatis's effort before the break. Arsenal loanee Joel Campbell's precise shot doubled the lead and the visitors only came to life late on. Robin van Persie blazed over the top when they finally opened up the Greeks. It would have been an injustice to the hosts had the Dutchman converted his late chance, however, after United's current limitations were exposed on a chastening night. Olympiakos lead the Greek Super League by 20 points, having won 24 of 26 games, in sharp contrast to their opponents' increasingly forlorn Premier League title defence. And, after reverses for Manchester City and Arsenal last week, the Greeks inflicted the third defeat of the round for English sides. Olympiakos manager Michel had suggested before kick-off that United, whose best hope of passage into next year's Champions League appeared to be winning this season's competition, could fold under the pressure of knockout football. The visitors, who were famously eliminated by Galatasaray in a similarly white-hot atmosphere in Istanbul in 1993, certainly fuelled the noisy home fans' enthusiasm with some early defensive wobbles. Media playback is not supported on this device After Rio Ferdinand had misplaced a couple of passes, a last-ditch challenge from Nemanja Vidic only just ended Dominguez's run after he had advanced into the area unchallenged. Dominguez continued to orchestrate Olympiakos's attacks from an advanced midfield role and with Juan Mata cup-tied, Adnan Januzaj left out of the match-day squad and Rooney frustrated by the referee and his own performance, the visitors lacked a similarly commanding figure. So it was fitting that it was the Argentine who opened the scoring. Maniatis's trundling low shot posed little danger to United goalkeeper David De Gea, but Dominguez's outstretched foot cleverly diverted the ball into the opposite corner giving the Spaniard too much ground to make up. United, who had lacked energy and invention, showed slightly more purpose before the break, but could not create any clear-cut chances, goalkeeper Roberto dealing competently with the visitors' crosses. The last time that Manchester United overturned a two-goal deficit in Europe was when they beat Diego Maradona's Barcelona 3-0 at Old Trafford in March 1984 in the quarter-finals of the Cup Winners' Cup. David Moyes's half-time team-talk needed to focus players' minds and change their tactics but neither was in evidence as Tom Cleverley knocked the ball out of play under no pressure soon after kick-off. A goal down, the visitors had no room for further error and Campbell's superb curling effort, after he slipped Michael Carrick's flimsy challenge, threatened to cut them adrift in the tie. Moyes introduced Shinji Kagawa and Danny Welbeck at the expense of Antonio Valencia and Cleverley, but it did little to change the momentum. Michael Olaitan sent a shot fizzing just over as the hosts revelled in the space and uncertainty in United's defence. Only in the final 10 minutes were United able to bring any pressure to bear, but, after two measured touches had given him a clear sight of goal, Van Persie crashed over the top with his weaker right foot from Chris Smalling's cross. It summed up a miserable new episode in Moyes's faltering first season in charge.	Manchester United's Champions League campaign is in serious peril after they were comfortably beaten by Olympiakos in the last-16 first leg in Athens.
The hosts were on course for the second highest chase in women's Twenty20 internationals before rain intervened. Sarah Taylor (66) top-scored in England's 156-6 but Dane van Niekerk hit 63 as South Africa reached 145-3 when the match was called off. England, who had never lost a T20 to South Africa before this match, dropped Van Nierkerk on 6 and 22. Van Nierkerk's 63 came off 43 balls, hitting seven fours and two sixes, as she put on 68 with captain Mignon du Preez. That partnership took South Africa to 98-1, but Du Preez scored 47 not out and Marizanne Kapp 21 to take South Africa home. England will rue their missed chances in the South Africa innings when a sloppy fielding performance saw them drop a number of catches, leak runs and miss run-out chances. Taylor scored 66 from 52 balls for England, with eight fours, her second half-century of the series after her unbeaten 74 in England's win in Paarl. Taylor had partnerships of 63 with Heather Knight (29) and 61 with captain Charlotte Edwards (34) but England struggled to kick on in the latter overs. Despite late hitting from Danielle Wyatt, who scored 17 not out, England lost two wickets to run-outs in the final over in which they scored just four runs. England captain Charlotte Edwards: "I thought we batted well and that should have been enough. We were undone by a brilliant innings by Van Niekerk and dropped catches cost us. "We let ourselves down a little bit, but Dane really took the attack to us. We must take our chances." South Africa captain Mignon Du Preez: "We knew that we had the firepower in the line-up, even though we had to go at eight an over. The momentum is with us so we're looking forward to a very competitive game at the Wanderers." Dane van Niekerk: "I enjoyed myself at the top of the order. I did things differently than yesterday and it came up. I'm hitting the ball well." Former England batter Ebony Rainford-Brent: "England bowled poorly and dropped catches and weren't up to standard. If they play at their best they will be fine because they have talented players such as Sarah Taylor, but they need to work on their game for the World Twenty20." Both sides travel to the Wanderers for Sunday's series decider which gets underway at 8:00 GMT. Sunday's match is both teams' last before the World Twenty20 in India which starts on 15 March, with England beginning their campaign against Bangladesh in Bangalore on 17 March.	South Africa beat England by 17 runs on the Duckworth-Lewis method to level the Twenty20 series with one game to go.
Oliver Hawkins turned in from six yards to put the Daggers ahead, before Matty Blair's strike and Adi Yussuf's left-footed finish gave the Stags the lead. Pearce was sent off and conceded a penalty for tripping Jamie Cureton, but the striker fired over from the spot. Matt Green slotted in for Mansfield, and the visitors could not rescue a point despite Cureton's late goal. Dagenham & Redbridge coach Ian Culverhouse told BBC Radio London: Media playback is not supported on this device "I thought we were excellent first half. Controlled the game in good parts, scored a well-deserved goal and went into the half deserved winners. "It's a bit of a blow really to come out on the wrong side of it.

Polish national Daria Pionko, 21, was found in Springwell Road, Holbeck, at about 01:30 GMT on Wednesday. Police said Miss Pionko, who had been living in Leeds, was a sex worker. She was taken to hospital for treatment, but died a short time later. A 38-year-old man was arrested in connection with the incident. Miss Pionko had been found unconscious with injuries consistent with an assault, West Yorkshire Police said. Officers found her in a defined managed area where sex workers operate during set hours, the force said. The force appealed for witnesses to come forward and in particular anyone who was in the Springwell Road area between 20:00 Tuesday and about 01:30 Wednesday.	A woman who died after being found seriously injured in Leeds, sparking a murder inquiry, has been named by police.
The 27-year-old man from Blackburn was riding a grey Triumph Daytona motorcycle along the B6479 near Selside when he crashed at 19:25 BST on Wednesday. The air ambulance was called but the biker died at the scene. The road was closed for five hours to allow collision investigators to examine it.	A motorbiker has died after hitting a sign at the side of the road in North Yorkshire.
Police now have a DNA profile for the mother of the girl whose bones were discovered by a member of the public at Washlands nature reserve in Wakefield. Forensic analysis of the remains suggest they had been left in the area some time before October 2015. A post-mortem examination was inconclusive, police said. Live updates on this story and others from around Yorkshire The bones were found in a blue plastic bag wrapped in a pair of dark leggings or trousers, which had a drawstring at the waist and were from Matalan, police said. They were discovered just off a towpath leading from Welbeck Lane on 3 May last year. West Yorkshire Police said it was believed the baby was born at full term. Det Ch Insp Nicola Bryar, from the homicide and major inquiry team, said the DNA profile of the mother meant several people had been ruled out of the inquiry. She said: "Twelve months on we continue to appeal for the mother of this baby to come forward. "While she may not require medical assistance, she will have suffered deep trauma and may very well be in need of some counselling and professional emotional support."	A plea has been made to trace the mother of a baby whose remains were found in a plastic bag at a nature reserve a year ago.
Leading F1 commercial figure Zak Brown has been contacted by McLaren as the company seeks a replacement. Dennis has been told by the two parties that own 75% of McLaren Group that his contract will not be renewed for 2017. But Brown, a 44-year-old American, is also considered a potential chief commercial officer for F1's new owners. The US media group Liberty is in the process of buying a controlling interest in the sport's commercial arm from investment group CVC Capital Partners. The deal is expected to be completed early next year. Brown is of particular interest to McLaren because of his success in finding new sponsors for a number of teams on the grid in his former role as boss of the marketing agency JMI, from which he resigned in September. McLaren have not had a title sponsor since parting company with mobile phone company Vodafone at the end of 2013. Ironically, McLaren have had a major success in recent weeks in securing a new partnership deal for BP/Castrol to become their fuel and lubricant supplier. The deal has been signed but has not yet been announced. The company will replace Exxon Mobil, which has been poached by Red Bull for next season after 21 years with McLaren. That deal is expected to be announced imminently. The three names revealed by BBC Sport over the US Grand Prix weekend - ex-F1 team bosses Ross Brawn, Martin Whitmarsh and former Sainsbury's boss Justin King - remain of interest to McLaren and have been contacted by the team. But all three are now considered unlikely to take on the position. They may be unwilling to put themselves forward or it may be decided they are not the best person for the role. It is also possible Dennis, who is chairman and chief executive officer and has been in charge at McLaren for 35 years, would be replaced by two different people, as would be a more conventional company structure. Brown is friendly with all the main shareholders at McLaren, including Dennis. But BBC Sport understands that the Bahrainis and Ojjeh are now reaching out to him as they seek a new man to run the company. If McLaren can persuade him to take the role, it would be something of a coup for the team, since it has long been known that Brown has been favourite for the commercial head of F1 job at Liberty Media. Despite the ultimatum by his fellow shareholders, Dennis has been telling friends and confidants that he will decide when or if he will step down, not anyone else. But it is far from clear that he is in a position to make that decision. If his contract is not renewed, he would remain a 25% shareholder but would probably have no active role or power in running the company. Dennis will fight hard to retain his position as the head of McLaren, despite the fracturing of relationships between him on the one hand and Ojjeh and the Bahrainis on the other. He has run the company since 1981 and has become synonymous with McLaren, which he has built up into one of the sport's most successful teams, as well as launching a road-car company that sells high-end supercars. Dennis had been trying to find investment to enable him to buy a controlling shareholding in McLaren Group. He did have an agreement with Ojjeh and Mumtalakat that he could buy sufficient shares to take him over over 50% were he to find that investment. Dennis found two separate Chinese groups of investors. One was on the verge of completing a deal with Dennis before a weakening of the Chinese economy caused the arrangement to collapse. He then sourced a second group of Chinese investors and took them to Ojjeh and Mumtalkat, who refused to sell their shares because they did not want to grant Dennis so much power in the company.	A surprise new name has emerged as a potential successor to long-standing McLaren boss Ron Dennis, whose position as chairman is under threat.
A group chaired by Paralympic multi-gold medallist Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson says it would be the first country in the world to take that step. It would mean more time for sport, but unions worry too many core curriculum subjects could dilute their importance. The Welsh government said it would consider the recommendation. Education Minister Leighton Andrews said he wanted to look into how schools can increase levels of physical activity in children and young people. By Arwyn JonesBBC Wales education correspondent Although the need for more exercise is clear enough, it isn't just a simple matter of adding PE as a core subject. Pupils in Wales already have as core subjects Welsh, English, maths and sciences. They are the areas the government has decided should have most time and resources allocated to them. And teaching unions fear the more you add to that core, the less of a priority they each become. More than one-third are either overweight or obese, costing the Welsh NHS more than £70m a year. The current core subjects in schools in Wales are English, Welsh (as a first language), mathematics, and science, while physical education is a foundation subject. Having PE elevated to a core part of the curriculum would mean more time devoted to it, as well as extra resources and more training for teachers. Schools would also need to give greater priority to provision for PE. As a result: • Teachers would be required to be competent to deliver the subject on completion of their initial teacher training. • Well qualified, specialist teachers would be needed to work with schools to ensure high-quality provision. • Standards and provision in physical education would be rigorously reviewed in school, both by the educational consortia and by schools inspectorate Estyn. • Progress would be regularly measured. The move to give PE more status in schools would be a bold move but an important one, according to the group. In its report, the group, which also included the chair of Sports Wales Laura McAllister, said: "Given the Welsh government's commitment to making physical literacy as important a development skill as reading and writing, the group felt that changing the status of physical education is the only credible and secure way of ensuring this." But while teaching unions support the idea, they are worried that too many subjects on the core curriculum could dilute their importance. Dr Philip Dixon, director of ATL Cymru, said it was important to decide on "what small core we want". "We certainly want literacy and numeracy in there," he said. "We may well want physical education in there too, that's for the government to decide. "But the core has to be kept very small or else we'll see a core which isn't a core and that's just ridiculous." Owen Hathway, Wales policy officer at the NUT, also warned that schools already had a heavy curriculum in Wales. "We are constantly being told that literacy and numeracy is a priority, " he said. "Science is being pushed as a priority with its importance to future PISA testing. We have the core subjects of maths, English, Welsh and so on already in place, while IT is also being promoted as a priority. "Quite simply, by the nature of the word, not everything can be a priority." Responding to the report, Education Minister Leighton Andrews said he would be considering the report in the context of the wider review of the national curriculum and assessment. "We firmly believe in the positive impact that physical activity can have on the people and nation of Wales and I'm determined to ensure that sport continues to make an important contribution to Welsh life," he added. Sport Minister John Griffiths said sport was important as it improves health and wellbeing, along with helping with team building and making friends. "We are committed to widening access and encouraging greater participation in physical activity as the health benefits of making physical exercise a part of everyone's daily lives is well-understood," he added.	PE should be given the same status as maths, English, science and Welsh in schools to help tackle obesity in Wales, experts have recommended.
The pilot was flying solo during a training flight on Thursday and radioed for assistance while returning to RAF Leeming in North Yorkshire. The Hawk jet was promptly joined by another aircraft from the same squadron as a wingman to provide guidance. They then flew in formation and landed safely. The RAF has offered no further details on the condition of the pilot. A spokesman said: "Flying in formation, and conducting an approach to land as a formation, is a daily skill practised by RAF fast jet pilots."	An RAF pilot was guided into landing his jet by a colleague in another aircraft after suffering "a partial loss of vision", it has emerged.
McGuigan and father Barry, the former world champion, signed Taylor to their Cyclone Promotions company when he won 2014 Commonwealth gold and turned pro. "I thought you saw the complete article," said Shane McGuigan of the man from Prestonpans in East Lothian. "He looked like he could punch - now he can really punch since changing the technique a bit." In addition, the trainer said he was keen to work with Taylor because "he has a great personality, he's a good-looking lad, he's fast and he can really fight - he ticked a lot of boxes". He added: "Also, I felt dad, with his background, a hall of famer, being a Celt himself, can appeal to a lot of the public in Scotland." Taylor left Edinburgh's Lochend club, where he worked under Terry McCormack, and now trains for his pro fights at the McGuigans' gym in Wandsworth, south London. He is aiming for a 10th consecutive win when he defends his Commonwealth super-lightweight title against Hackney's WBC Silver champion Ohara Davies at Glasgow's Braehead Arena on 8 July. "Josh is a phenomenal talent, a phenomenal force," added McGuigan junior. "He's been pro for a short time and he's already the Commonwealth champion and within six to 10 months he will be knocking on the door of a world title. "We've been working together for nearly two years now and he has excelled so quickly. "He has come out of the elite level amateur system and he is still progressing. "He has shown me so much in the gym and now it is our chance to really showcase that talent on the main stage in front of big audiences on television and at Braehead." Cyclone Promotions hopes Taylor will generate the same level of appeal as his stablemate, Belfast's Carl Frampton, a two-weight world champion. "With Carl, we built him up at home and then we took him to America and then to Manchester for a unification fight," said Shane McGuigan. "That's the same sort of platform we would like to set up for Josh Taylor. "We'd like to make him a star back home in Scotland and then filter him out to London, Manchester and the bigger arenas and then eventually go to the States. That is where he is inevitably going to end up, that's where the money is. "It is very rare that you have the Errol Spencers coming to fight for world titles over here. If you build loyalty with your fans they will go anywhere." The McGuigans have already had Taylor on the road, with three of his nine fights being in El Paso, New York and Las Vegas. "The American public loved his crowd-pleasing style, just like they loved Ricky Hatton," said the trainer. "People want to see a good fighter go to work and they will get that with Josh Taylor." Shane McGuigan is anticipating a "tricky" fight against undefeated Davies next month, expecting it to go to the later rounds. However, he believes the home fighter will prevail and take over the mantle of Ricky Burns, for so long Scotland's main boxing attraction but who, in April, lost his WBA belt in Taylor's weight class to Namibia's IBF champion Julius Indongo. "Ricky Burns has been a fantastic ambassador for Scottish boxing and a great champion but I don't see him reclaiming any world title; he's a step below that now. "Josh Taylor is the man. He is going to be holding the flag and going on to bigger and better things. If he can inherit some of Ricky's fans then that would be fantastic."	Scotland's Josh Taylor has all the elements it takes to make it to the top in boxing, says trainer Shane McGuigan.
Medway Council is to stop new takeaways opening near secondary schools at lunchtime and near secondaries and primaries after school. The council said there were currently 179 takeaways within 400m of a school. The British Retail Consortium (BRC) said it was simplistic to treat all fast food restaurants in the same way. The restrictions will be used as guidance when the planning committee considers new planning applications. Councillor Jane Chitty said Medway's public health and children's services were extremely concerned about obesity. "Allowing the planning committee to take this guidance into account is a positive step," she said. Local authority health profile figures show 30% of adults in Medway are obese, while the average for England is 24.2% and the wider South East 23.7%. Among children in Medway, 20% of 10-year-olds are obese. "To do nothing is not an option," said Councillor David Brake. "We are already seeing the effect obesity has on our National Health Service and anything we can do to prevent this at an early age is welcome." A secondary and grammar school that responded to a six-week consultation on the restrictions supported the restrictions. But the Kent Small Business Federation has called them draconian and said obesity needed to be tackled by changing behaviour. The BRC said local authorities should encourage companies that wanted to play a positive role in public health and target those that were less responsible. "There are those that are working positively to cut obesity by removing fats and sugars from food and giving clear calorie labelling on their menu boards to help customers make healthier choices," said director of food and sustainability Andrew Opie.	A Kent council has voted to restrict the opening hours of fast food outlets near schools in a bid to tackle rising obesity.
The Pro12 side are to switch from Murrayfield from January to May with a view to playing the 2017-18 campaign at the George Watson's College ground. Myreside's capacity is to be increased to around 6,000 with temporary stands. Edinburgh used the venue in the early years of professionalism and last played a match there during the 2015 Six Nations. "This is about building a strong future for the club at a home ground in the city that better suits our needs and improves the match day experience for fans and players alike," said Edinburgh managing director Jonny Petrie. Work will now start on bringing the facilities at the home of Premiership club Watsonians up to pro-level standards. Edinburgh have been playing at Murrayfield since 2004, with room for 67,500 spectators at the national stadium. "Having a smaller venue, with the crowds we are getting just now - and being able to grow that, will be much better for us," Petrie told BBC Scotland. "That's been a challenge at Murrayfield when sometimes the crowd gets lost. "We'll have a home venue the players can really indentify with, they can become closer to the supporters, and it becomes a more intimidating place for teams to come as well." Edinburgh will have the option of returning to Murrayfield for bigger matches, such as the 1872 Cup encounters with Glasgow Warriors. Alan Solomons' side finished a disappointing ninth in the Pro12, having won just three out of 10 matches since their back-to-back successes against defending champions Warriors over the festive season. "The season has been frustrating in many respects," admitted Petrie. "We've ended up behind where we hoped we would. "But we've been investing in the squad and we're comfortable with where we are going." Former Watsonians and Scotland centre Scott Hastings hailed the move as "innovative", and believes Myreside could develop into an Edinburgh stronghold in years to come. "At Murrayfield, Edinburgh were rattling round in a huge stadium," he told BBC Scotland. "For me, the beauty of Edinburgh rugby is it's all about passion, all about creating an atmosphere. "Ultimately, it's up to the players to respond by playing attractive, dynamic rugby, but also for the crowd to get behind the team and to be more intimate and vocal within creating an atmosphere. "It's a stepping stone process. The pipeline dream is to have a 3G pitch in there so there's not any debate over the surface. The floodlights need a little bit of improvement; the facilities certainly need an overhaul. "I've commentated across European and world rugby, and really Edinburgh should be punching at least a minimum of 10,000 supporters. You just have to look at our neighbours in the Pro12, someone like Ulster, who play at an 18,000-seater stadium. Ultimately, I think that will be Edinburgh's objective, but this is the stepping stone process to get them there."	Edinburgh will play their home matches at Myreside for the second half of next season.
If it does it won't be without a fight. Thousands of villagers have been taking to the streets every day in a brazen challenge to the authorities. At the time of writing there has not yet been an attempt to smash these demonstrations but special police are moving into the area by the busload. The Guangdong Government has been urging us to leave. There are really only two possibilities. One: They think that without media coverage some of the steam will come out of the protests, allowing the nearby city government to come up with some sort of negotiated settlement. Two: With no international media to observe and record, the riot police can be sent in to bring Wukan under control the hard way. We asked government official Chen Jiasheng, if we left, how likely it would be for this second option to occur and he told the BBC: "As head of the Guangdong provincial press office I can guarantee you that your fantasy will never happen." Local Communist Party Secretary Lin Zuluan is seen as a hero to the villagers. He's now in custody but people here want him released. He was one of the leaders in the rebellion of 2011 when the former government was overthrown. Elections were permitted as part of the deal to end the conflict nearly five years ago and he was chosen as village chief in a landslide. But recently he had threatened to re-start the protest movement as a way of pushing yet again for these people to receive compensation for the land they say was stolen from them in the past by corrupt officials. Yet, before he could make good with this threat, the 72 year old was taken away. In an interview with the BBC, Shanwei City Chief Prosecutor Yuan Huaiyu said, following a tip off from "someone on the internet or maybe even a villager", Lin Zuluan was being held in custody and investigated in relation to kickbacks on several infrastructure projects including roads and a school library. The prosecutor wouldn't say how much money was allegedly involved. He said they have received evidence from developers giving bribes and some documents. Asked about the timing of Lin Zuluan's detention he said: "We've had a preliminary investigation lasting more than three months. Possibly the timing is a coincidence but this is a judicial process and we're doing our job". Even though their former leader has been shown on television in a recorded "confession", the villagers of Wukan think these are trumped up charges to shut down an effective campaigner. Prosecutor Yuan says the villagers don't yet understand what their leader has done but said he expects they'll change their mind once they see the evidence. Asked by the BBC if there was any chance that Lin Zuluan could be released, Prosecutor Yuan laughed out loud and said: "We need to see how this case develops". The election of Wukan's government had given people in villages right around the country great hope for what might be possible under the Chinese system as it stands today. Where else could you see virtually the entire population of town or a village filling the streets in support for their Communist Party Secretary? Even given the risks involved - in a country where you can be thrown in jail for challenging the Party - there is a remarkable unity of purpose amongst the people of Wukan, from primary school children to elderly fishermen who each day answer the call to join in the struggle. "Free Lin Zuluan!" they chant as they march. "Return our land!" And, it's always followed by: "Long live the Communist Party!" They're hoping that more senior political figures might override the nearby city government and come to their aid. In 2011 that's exactly what happened. After expelling the officials they saw as corrupt, they barricaded the village. The former Guangdong Party Chief Wang Yang brought an end to the standoff which had lasted months. He gave permission for a directly-elected government and said this would become known as "the Wukan model". Wang Yang was seen as a peacemaker: a powerful party leader prepared to push for a calm and reasonable outcome as opposed to the heavy-handed tactics normally employed to crush dissent in China. He appeared destined for promotion into the elite politburo standing committee. But he didn't get there. Now there's no Wang Yang as Guangdong party chief. Some analysts believe that Wukan's elections could only have happened in that unique moment in history and that the window has now closed. What's more if Lin Zuluan is prosecuted and most likely given a prison sentence it is hard to see such an open election process being allowed in order to choose his successor. But the problem for Party elites trying to decide what to do with Wukan is that people here are now used to having one of their own in charge. They're organised. They're committed. They're united. They know the meaning of a long political struggle. Getting them to settle for anything less than what they have now is not going to be easy.	This has been a place which - unlike anywhere else in China - had a genuinely elected government but many here are wondering if the so-called "Wukan experiment" is about to die.
"Despite so many false statements and lies, total and complete vindication...and WOW, Comey is a leaker!" he tweeted early on Friday. Mr Comey told Congress under oath he believed he was fired to influence his investigation into the Trump campaign. The ex-FBI boss led one of several Russia inquiries before he was sacked. It is not clear what falsehoods Mr Trump is referring to but his lawyer has rejected as untrue several key parts of Mr Comey's testimony. Mr Comey, who testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday, said the president pressured him to drop an investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn. Mr Flynn was himself forced out after misleading the vice-president about conversations with Russia's ambassador before Mr Trump took office. Mr Comey also said the president defamed him and the FBI by claiming the agency was "poorly led", which Mr Comey called "lies, plain and simple". He said he began writing memos after his meetings with Mr Trump because he was "honestly worried he might lie". He leaked details of his memos after an account of it had already been published in the press. As a result of that episode, a special counsel was appointed to lead an independent investigation into the Trump campaign's potential ties to the Kremlin. But there is no known evidence of collusion between Russia and the US, and President Donald Trump has dismissed the story as "fake news". After the hearing, the president's personal lawyer issued a statement rejecting many of Mr Comey's allegations. Marc Kasowitz said on Thursday that the president never sought to impede the investigation into possible Russian interference in the US election and that Mr Comey's leaks should be investigated. He also said the testimony confirmed that Mr Trump was not under investigation as part of any probe into Russian political meddling. Hours later, Mr Trump ignored reporters when asked about whether Mr Comey was telling the truth.	US President Donald Trump has broken his Twitter silence after James Comey's explosive testimony to appear to accuse the former FBI chief of perjury.
Nia Griffith said her party offers "investment in Wales, versus cuts from Westminster" by the Tories. She urged people to "imagine the price" if there was a Conservative government in Wales as well. "Labour changes peoples' lives when we are in government", Ms Griffith added. She reinforced the message of First Minister Carwyn Jones, who told delegates on Saturday that the assembly election in May would be a straight fight between Labour and the Conservatives. "Together we are fighting for Wales in Westminster and taking on the Tories' appalling treatment of our nation," Ms Griffith said. "We need to tell families up and down the country about what our Welsh Labour government is delivering. "Investment in Wales, versus cuts from Westminster - jobs for our young people, not leaving a generation behind. "That's the difference that a Labour government makes. Labour policies promised then delivered because we are in government. "So don't listen to those who say we should be happy just shouting from the sidelines, that principled opposition is better than political power. "If we take that attitude we may as well shut up shop." Ms Griffith pointed to Labour's establishment of the NHS, introduction of the minimum wage, and delivering devolution with the creation of the National Assembly. Meanwhile Mr Jones has said income tax rates in Wales would stay the same as those in England under a Labour Welsh government. He told the Sunday Supplement programme on BBC Radio Wales he would not use new powers to increase income taxes if Labour won the assembly election. "People have a real squeeze on their personal finances and the last thing I want to do is add to that pressure," he said, Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale has proposed an increase of 1p in the pound for taxpayers in Scotland.	Labour makes a difference in power, not in "principled opposition", the shadow Welsh secretary has told the party's Welsh conference in Llandudno.
Morgan Owen, from Buckley, Flintshire, died after being restrained on 5 December. He had also been stunned with a Taser by police two days earlier. The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) backed North Wales Police's actions. An inquest jury concluded the death was accidental through taking cocaine. The inquest in Abergele, Conwy county, heard Mr Owen, 24, suffered cardiac arrest as a result of taking the drug. He was found to have "toxic" levels of cocaine in his body. He collapsed shortly after being held by members of the public because he was kicking cars as he made his way along Farm Road. Police were called and Mr Owen was handcuffed but officers noticed almost immediately he had no pulse and attempts to revive him were unsuccessful. The inquest focused on the attitude of the officers towards him. Officers had also been called to other incidents in the days before Mr Owen's death including the one where the Taser was used. The jury was told of concerns that more was not done to respond to his mental state and questions were raised about whether he was treated appropriately given the behaviour he was demonstrating. The IPCC investigation looked at a number of complaints from Mr Owen's family about the police handling of the incidents. It found where police used force, including deploying the Taser, it was necessary and appropriate. It added police had taken steps to assist Mr Owen's welfare and to protect others and tried along with a member of the public to resuscitate him before paramedics arrived. IPCC Commissioner Jan Williams said: "Ultimately this was a very sad series of incidents. "Our investigation found that North Wales Police officers did act in a proportionate and reasonable way in their interactions with Morgan."	Action taken by police on a soldier who died after being handcuffed during a disturbance was "reasonable and proportionate", an investigation found.
What is regarded to be Europe's largest one-day sale of hill sheep has been held in Sutherland. Tens of thousands of animals, mostly lambs, were auctioned at Lairg. The sheep were transported to a livestock mart in the small Highlands village from all over the north of Scotland. Ahead of the sale, United Auctions' Donald Morrison said it "looked promising" for good prices for crofters and farmers selling sheep.	Images by BBC Naidheachdan.
Jahed Choudhury, 24, married Sean Rogan at Walsall Register Office and shared his story on YouTube. However, he told the Victoria Derbyshire Show he had been threatened online and in the street. But the couple said they had also received messages of support and would continue to share their story. Since their ceremony Mr Choudhury said the couple had received death threats online and abuse on the streets. "The worst [messages] say 'the next time I see you in the streets, I'm going to throw acid in your face'. "Even if I walk down the streets, I have people spitting on me and calling me pig - all the nasty stuff. I just keep walking." The couple said they had not yet reported the incident to police and were considering whether to do so. Mr Choudhury said he had also received "amazing" support from his online followers, including people who said the couple had inspired them to come out. "I've been brought up Muslim and the Koran mentions you cannot be gay and Muslim. But this is how I have chosen to live my life. I will never get rid of my faith." Mr Choudhury said he had attempted suicide in the past but added his family had been "really supportive" since he came out. He has now set up a YouTube channel where his story received more than 5,000 views, and says he was motivated to speak out online to encourage support for gay people from religious backgrounds.	A man thought to be one of the first UK Muslims to have a same-sex marriage said people have threatened to throw acid in his face since the ceremony.
John Swinney said the tool would help "all of our children to succeed". The resource details examples from around Scotland which have improved the wellbeing and learning of children in the classroom. Approaches include parent questionnaires, a family breakfast club and a walk-to-school programme. Mr Swinney said: The information now available gives teachers and school leaders access to effective interventions based on practice examples from around Scotland. "This suite of materials will be developed further in the coming weeks and months to include successful approaches based on the best available international evidence as we work with the Education Endowment Foundation to develop a Scottish specific version of their highly-regarded Teaching and Learning toolkit." The online resource will be added to in the coming weeks. Bill Maxwell, chief executive of Education Scotland, hoped the tool would help schools make decisions about closing the attainment gap between their "most and least disadvantaged children". He added: "The interventions highlighted in this resource represent the wide range of different approaches which have been developed in Scotland, and which have proved to be effective. "Education Scotland has a key role in ensuring that schools have easy access to evidence about 'what works' as they plan to address the priorities of the Scottish Attainment Challenge and the National Improvement Framework."	An online education resource showcasing the best way to increase attainment in Scotland's schools has been launched by the country's education secretary.
The technology and administration services provider, which employs 300 people in Northern Ireland, has won a government contract worth £500,000. Its system is designed to help with the recording, planning and scheduling of staff. The Passport Office has 2,500 employees working from 37 locations across the UK. The platform will initially be used in Glasgow and then rolled out to the six other Passport Office locations throughout the UK. Equiniti secured the deal though the government's G-Cloud procurement framework. Nigel Farr, one of the company's directors, said: "Working patterns have changed dramatically over the last decade and far fewer businesses operate the stereotypical nine-to-five hours." "Having a time and attendance system that is cloud-based is increasingly becoming essential in order to accommodate anything from flexible working or remote working to job sharing and hot-desking across locations," he added. "Her Majesty's Passport Office has increased its flexibility and capability to respond to extreme external pressures which have a direct effect on its workforce requirements."	Belfast-based firm Equiniti has been selected to provide a cloud-based system for the Passport Office.
WhatsApp and similar applications make it possible for news organisations to reach the far-flung corners of the globe where other media are often blocked. Here are a few recent examples of how you have enhanced BBC News output by getting in touch via the app. A total of 38 people were killed in an attack on a beach in Tunisia on 26 June 2015. They were killed when a gunman, with links to so-called Islamic State extremists, opened fire on a beach in Sousse, outside two hotels. He had hidden a gun under a beach umbrella and he threw grenades, forcing people to run for their lives. Eyewitness Anthony Ryan got in touch with us as the news was breaking. He was able to tell us what was happening from his balcony. He could see his hotel's entertainers on the beach and could hear shouting. He could also see that two people had been brought into the hotel next door on sun beds, and were badly injured. Simon Philips shared his experience of the attacks in Paris on the night of Friday 13 November. Gunmen and suicide bombers attacked a concert hall, a major stadium, restaurants and bars, almost simultaneously. Mr Philips, a dual French and British citizen, was sitting with his girlfriend outside La Belle Equipe bar in the rue de Charonne in the 11th district, when two men opened fire on the terrace of the cafe. He described what he had seen as "endless scenes of war". "It was complete and utter chaos. The noise of the bullets outweighed those of screams and sirens afterwards," he said. Earlier last year, we reported on the most powerful earthquake to have hit Nepal in decades. Hundreds of people were killed, and many others were trapped and injured in the quake in April. Many of the BBC's eyewitnesses to this quake came through WhatsApp, which is widely used in that part of the world. Those affected ranged from local people to the region's many tourists and climbers on Mount Everest. As well as keeping us informed of news stories, you have been telling us how you use WhatsApp every day. Jean Macleod from Glasgow, UK, says she uses it every day to message her son, Ewan, in Australia. "He's in Sydney and I'm in Glasgow. It keeps us in touch every morning and night, and if I didn't have it I'd completely crash as I miss him so much. We're not always available at the same times, so it's a bonus alongside phone calls. I use it on holiday too. Last year, on holidays in Uganda, I kept in touch with all my family including my daughter in London, and husband in Glasgow." Mal Smith agrees: "I use WhatsApp to speak to relatives in Switzerland and for sending video and pictures to family and friends. My mobile provider charges me extra for sending pictures over their network." And Julia Kinsey says she uses it at home in rural Suffolk, UK. "Mobile signal is very patchy in our house," she said. "So I use it for communicating with family in London and friends nationwide. I would feel very isolated without it." Compiled by Francesca Neagle	Mobile messaging service WhatsApp is now said to be used by a billion people monthly, but it is not just a conduit for social chat and event planning.
The association and groups including the Mountaineering Council of Scotland have raised concerns in the past about rubbish being left in the shelters. Use of bothies increases in summer months. The MBA has now issued a new message asking people to help keep bothies in a tidy state. The association said: "With summer upon us we are seeing many visitors to bothies, especially on the more popular long-distance trails, who perhaps have not used one before and who seem unaware that unlike in some other countries, our mountain bothies are not serviced and have no rubbish collection service. "Bothies rely on you to remove your litter, and that of any inconsiderate others, so please help where you can." Last year, one of two volunteers who looks after Corrour Bothy in the Lairig Ghru, Cairngorms, told of taking four hours to sort through and burn waste left there. Neil Reid said hillwalkers had to be willing to pick up litter they find.	The Mountain Bothies Association has appealed to hillwalkers and climbers to help keep more than 100 shelters it looks after in the UK clean and tidy.
All 42 of its member clubs are expected to take strict disciplinary measures against fans who indulge in anti-social behaviour during matches. The updated guidance, which comes into force immediately, states that home clubs are responsible for "good order and security". Clubs are also urged to step up efforts to identify culprits. Under the previous rules, clubs could argue that they had taken all practical steps to deter misbehaviour inside their stadiums. Now they must been seen to actively pursue cases and take "appropriate" action against the perpetrators. In June, following disorder at the Scottish Cup final, Justice Secretary Michael Matheson called for "a transparent and robust scheme" to prevent and deal with unacceptable conduct. He went on to warn: "The Scottish government is prepared to act if Scottish football isn't." On the rule changes, SPFL chief executive Neil Doncaster said: "The SPFL and its member clubs are committed to preventing and to addressing unacceptable conduct where it arises, to ensure our stadiums are friendly, welcoming and safe environments where all supporters can enjoy Scottish football. "This ongoing work includes this updated guidance for clubs which sets out the reasonably practicable measures that member clubs can take to address this issue and to identify and sanction those who engage in unacceptable conduct. "It has been fully consulted on with all 42 clubs, the Scottish FA and the Scottish Government and, indeed, dialogue continues with the Government on a number of further measures which will be discussed early this year."	The Scottish Professional Football League has issued new regulations aimed at tackling supporter misconduct.
The death toll doubled over the last two days as officials found more than 100 bodies once waters began receding. Officials estimate that the floods have affected 450,000 people in the state. This years monsoon rains have affected millions across at least 20 states in India. The north-eastern state of Assam has also seen dozens killed and hundreds of thousands displaced. The government has announced aid packages for affected areas and Prime Minister Narendra Modi is due to visit Assam on Tuesday. He has said the aim of his visit is to find a "permanent solution" to the flooding that Assam faces every year. The Press Trust of India news agency quoted an official as saying that many affected people in Gujarat had begun returning to their villages.	Floods in the western Indian state of Gujarat have killed 218 people, government officials have confirmed.
Lee, who died last year, is revered by Singaporeans, while his children are respected members of the establishment. His son, Lee Hsien Loong, is prime minister. The family had presented a united front, but that cracked in recent days when Lee Wei Ling, a prominent doctor and newspaper columnist, publicly objected to what she saw as excess in the one-year commemorations. She also accused the government - led by her brother - of exploiting his legacy for its own gain, which Prime Minister Lee has rebutted. The exchange has shocked Singaporeans - public disputes among the establishment in this tightly controlled city are extremely rare, let alone one involving the country's equivalent of the royal family or the Kennedys. It has also fed into ongoing discussions on the tricky issue of how best to remember Lee Kuan Yew, a beloved idol who hated being one. Lee's death on 23 March last year prompted a massive outpouring of grief among Singaporeans who queued for hours to pay their respects, surprising even government officials. At least 100 events were organised for the one-year anniversary, ranging from solemn ceremonies and a candlelight vigil to tree-planting and kayaking events. Wax statues of Lee - widely known as LKY - and his wife were put on public display with flowers laid at their feet, a schoolbook teaching Lee's values was launched, while some ardent fans online even claimed to have seen his face in the clouds. Two days after the anniversary, amid unease in some quarters about the commemoration's intensity, Ms Lee posted a disapproving piece on Facebook arguing that her father would have objected. "Any veneration could have the opposite effect and lead future generations of Singaporeans to think that my father's actions were motivated by his desire for fame, or creation of a dynasty. He strove hard and determinedly in life to advance Singapore, and not for his place in history, or leaving a great legacy," she wrote. She later accused the government of wanting to "glorify my father", and alleged that a newspaper was doing the government's bidding by refusing to publish the piece unedited. The paper, The Straits Times, strongly denied her claims of censorship. In a now-deleted post of an exchange with the paper's editors, she wrote that her brother "has no qualms abusing his power to have a commemoration just one year after LKY died... if the power that be wants to establish a dynasty, LKY's daughter will not allow LKY's name to be sullied by a dishonourable son." One Sunday, the prime minister  released a statement saying her accusations were "completely untrue", adding that his government felt the level of commemoration and activities "were generally appropriate". In Singapore, Lee's admirers face the dilemma of how to honour a famously unsentimental figure who sternly disapproved of any worship - he refused statues and monuments in his name, and wanted his home to be eventually knocked down to prevent it from becoming a shrine. In a 1984 interview, Lee had made clear his objections to the idea of a personality cult in Singapore, saying: "The danger... is that when the leader dies, you are faced with the difficult problem of finding another." The Lee siblings' squabble has divided public opinions, with many taking to their Facebook pages to weigh in. Some agreed that the tributes bordered on the excessive and were disrespectful. "If he doesn't want to be hero worshipped then we shouldn't no matter what Singaporeans want. LKY has already given a lot to us. Let him rest in peace," said commenter Mohammad Nizam Abdul Kadir. "The best way we can remember him is to continue as a united, multi-racial, progressive country. Uphold his values and principles," said another called Mano Sabnani. But others argued that the round of commemoration activities was necessary for citizens, many of whom still feel a personal connection to Lee. "I am one of the many who wanted to express my gratitude to him and also to remember him for his commitment and contributions to Singapore. I would humbly ask Ms Lee Wei Ling to at least indulge us as we miss him too," said Daniel Ng. Carol Sim said: "Ms Lee has failed to understand that LKY does not belong to her alone. He belongs to the people of Singapore. We respect your choice to remember your father in your own quiet way but you certainly cannot stop the people from wanting to do more."	A rare spat among Singapore's first family has left citizens agog and fuelled debate on how the city-state's founding father Lee Kuan Yew should be remembered.
Jones, 31, suffered a shin injury while on international duty with Trinidad and Tobago on Tuesday. Cardiff manager Russell Slade said there was no break and Jones will be assessed once he returns to Wales. "We're hoping he will be in on Sunday," said Slade. "We don't know how long he'll be out for." This is the second time in the space of two months Jones has been unavailable for Cardiff following international duty. He missed the opening four games of the season after being deemed unfit following his involvement in the Gold Cup, held in America and Canada in July. The latest set-back came in his country's goalless draw with Nicaragua in Port of Spain when he was carried off on a stretcher after 73 minutes. "It's not broken, that's the most important thing, but there is a lot of swelling there. It will be assessed the moment he lands," said Slade. Jones' injury ends a miserable week for Slade that also saw him lose defender Bruno Ecuele Manga for at least two months to a groin injury sustained while training with Gabon. "As with Bruno, it's difficult to get the information you require," added Slade of Jones' condition. Cardiff missed the striker's presence on Saturday in a dour stalemate with Preston. Slade admitted his side were poor as they registered two efforts on target against a team that started the afternoon on the bottom of the Championship table. "I didn't think we got going until 50 or 60 minutes into the game and that can't happen," he said. "Clearly it's not something we designed or wanted. We set out exactly what we wanted to do but we didn't do that. "It can happen away from home sometimes, but it's dangerous because when you come up against top opposition, they will punish you in those periods. "We haven't served up too many halves like that so benefit of the doubt. "We came out for the second half and looked like a team again that wanted to go on and win a football match." Slade's mood on Saturday evening would not have been helped when one of his discarded strikers, Javi Guerra, put Rayo Vallecano in front against Barcelona in La Liga at the Nou Camp. Guerra, 33, moved to Rayo on a season-long loan in August after being told he was not in Slade's plans.	Cardiff City are waiting to discover the extent of the injury to Kenwyne Jones that forced the striker to miss Saturday's draw at Preston.
The Gills had agreed to sign defender N'Gala, 27, after he left Eastleigh. However, he played for Barnet and Eastleigh earlier this campaign, and rules state a player cannot appear for more than two teams in one season. But National League club Dover say they have been allowed to sign him following talks with the Football Association and English Football League. N'Gala started his career at West Ham, and had spells at Stevenage and Portsmouth before joining Barnet in 2014. He became Eastleigh's record signing when they bought him from the Bees in November. The Fifa Players' Transfer rules came into force this season, and recently led to Leyton Orient winger Ulrich Nnomo's proposed move to Paris FC being cancelled. Find all the latest football transfers on our dedicated page.	Bondz N'Gala has joined Dover, a week after a move to Gillingham fell through because of Fifa regulations.
Gammon joints, 700 pigs in blankets, cash and four charity boxes were also taken from MD Griffiths in Dinas Powys. Butcher Mark Griffiths, 62, said: "For some families their whole Christmas spread has been taken." He said he was in talks with wholesalers to try to replace what was stolen. Father-of-five Mr Griffiths, who has run the butcher's shop for 18 years, said: "There's never a good time for this to happen but during our Christmas rush it's particularly bad. "We lost turkeys, ducks, chickens, pigs in blankets - all the trimmings that make this time of year so special." "It's affected 25 orders but I'm determined not to let our customers down." Mr Griffiths discovered the break-in at 05:00 GMT on Friday when he noticed the panel on the door had been forced open. He said: "This is a family business and we are gutted to have been targeted in this way. "Customers have been back and forth to the shop to ask about their orders and we are doing what we can to recoup our loses." Customer Rowan Young, 50, described the thefts as "sickening", adding: "If we are the unlucky ones whose meat has gone then we fully understand."	Dozens of families could be without their Christmas dinner after thieves stole turkeys from a butcher's shop in Vale of Glamorgan.
Failed leadership candidate Lisa Duffy was having dinner with her staff in Bournemouth on Friday. No action was taken against the curry house, which had completed pre-employment checks. UKIP has long campaigned for tougher border controls to cut illegal immigration. Jay Beecher, a spokesman for Ms Duffy, said: "Watching our chef running away into the night, his apron flapping in the wind, was a surreal moment. "Politics can sometimes be such a stale and serous affair, so you have to see the funny side of things. "In this case too, I couldn't help [but] be tickled by the irony." The Border Agency questioned staff about their right to work and live in the UK. Diane James was elected ahead of Ms Duffy to succeed Nigel Farage as the UKIP's new leader on Friday.	Immigration officials raided an Indian restaurant during a UK Independence Party conference dinner, sending the chef "running into the night".
They are sitting on the dusty steps of a hair salon, feet tapping to the rhythm of music. "Music is a pleasure for us," Mr Toure says. "We can now dance and do whatever we want: We can walk together with women, we can shout, we're the young people of Timbuktu, this is what we like doing." Music was banned under the strict Islamic law that militant Islamists imposed when they took over the ancient desert city last year. All traditional folklore and ceremonies that make Malian culture vibrant were declared blasphemous. Other people soon join Mr Toure's little gathering, and a man offers to make some tea. The militants banned men and women from mixing in public. Now, Karia Cisse, who is passing by with a basket full of smoked fish on her head, grabs a cup. "We can chit-chat with our brothers, our friends, and even our boyfriends," she says. "It's a real pleasure, we're so happy. I want to thank God." Residents of Timbuktu can again enjoy the simple things they were used to, before the city fell under Islamist control 10 months ago. They can also dress the way they want to. Women have swapped the full black niqab, or full-face veil, for colourful local pagnes, a piece cloth wrapped around the body to form a skirt. Most of them wear a thin scarf over their head, just as they had in the past. There is an incredible feeling that the people are slowly coming back to life here. However, many have also been quick to vent the frustration and anger built up over months, which, they say, felt like a lifetime. In pictures: Why Malians now love France Scenes of looting on Tuesday revealed the deep inter-communal grievances and raised concerns about possible reprisal attacks. Dozens of people were out in the streets breaking into shops owned by ethnic Arabs and Tuaregs, whom they accuse of having collaborated with the militant Islamists. Weapons and boxes of ammunition were pulled out of at least one shop. However, most Arabs and Tuaregs have already left Timbuktu in fear of violence. But it is also time to uncover the wounds inflicted by the militants. In the city centre, a local bank had been turned into the headquarters of the Islamic police. The symbol of the jihadis - marked with a Koran, an AK-47 rifle and a cutlass that militants had cemented into the wall - has been taken down. A tiny cash machine attached to the building around the corner was used as a cell. Why do we know Timbuktu? In pictures: Timbuktu manuscripts "They threw me in and whipped me," says Salaka Djikke, 25. Ms Djikke was arrested at around 23:00 on New Year's Eve as she went for a romantic ride on her boyfriend's motorcycle. When they arrived in front of his house, her boyfriend saw four jihadis coming at them. She did not see them and got off the bike. "He drove off and got away, but they rushed at me and whipped me." Ms Djikke was sentenced to 95 lashes. It was carried out in a public place, all for being caught with a man she was not married to. Her boyfriend managed to escape and reached the capital, Bamako. He could have been stoned to death had he been arrested. Despite the scars she bears, Ms Djikke says that she does not regret taking the risk. "If they didn't hurt you, they'd hurt your sister or your brother. They terrorised the population," she says. "Even living under Sharia, it shouldn't be a crime to fall in love with another person," she says.	Yacouba Toure and a couple of his friends have gathered around his crackling radio in Mali's historic city of Timbuktu, soon after French-led troops captured it from militant Islamists.
Ron Jones, from Bassaleg, in Newport, only retired from collecting for the Royal British Legion Poppy Appeal in 2016, after 30 years' service. Mr Jones's advice for living to a ripe old age is to simply "live your natural life, that's all I've ever done". He is celebrating his centenary with a family party. Mr Jones was captured in the Middle East during World War Two and said he arrived at Auschwitz in October 1943. He said he never spoke about his experience at Auschwitz until the release of a Steven Spielberg film about the holocaust in 1994. "Nobody seemed interested until they put the Schindler's List on and then everybody found out about it of course," he said. Speaking about his arrival at the camp, Mr Jones told BBC Wales: "We saw all this barbed wire and men in pyjamas digging trenches, and someone said to one of the guards 'who the heck are they?' "He said 'Jews', just like that, as though we should have known. "And we couldn't understand what the smell was. Someone asked, and he said 'oh that's the crematorium'. "It took us two or three weeks before we actually accepted that they were gassing and burning them." He has previously recounted his experiences at the camp where he worked six days a week in a factory and being permitted to play football with his fellow soldiers on Sunday. Mr Jones said he used playing football with a "rag ball" as a form of escapism and embroidered the Prince of Wales' feathers on his shirts using old socks. "It was a relief, you know, to do something." But he said he returned home a different person: "It altered me. My wife used to look at me and say 'you're not the man I married'. "Well, I wasn't. I was a changed man completely when I came home. I was in a hell of a state. "I used to get nightmares and boils and all sorts. "It took me about four or five years before I was a normal man again, and then she used to kiss me and say 'you're back to normal'." Of his 100th birthday celebration, Mr Jones quipped: "I'll be glad when it's over because of the fuss they're making." Ant Metcalfe, the Royal British Legion's manager for Wales, said: "By sharing his incredible story of survival and resilience with the press and media Ron has touched so many people and left a lasting impression on many." Mike Jones, Poppy Appeal organiser for Gwent, added: "Ron is a true ambassador, such a character and a real gentleman.  Not only [was] he one of our oldest collectors but one of our most popular."	One of Britain's oldest poppy sellers, who was a prisoner of war in the Nazi death camp Auschwitz, celebrates his 100th birthday on Sunday.
The Â£22m road bridge linking Danestone and Tillydrone is aimed at easing congestion in the north of the city. It was supposed to be completed late last year but issues with re-routing underground utilities have caused a series of delays. The new crossing, which is expected to the called 'the Diamond Bridge' - will be opened on Thursday 9 June.	The third Don crossing in Aberdeen is to open next week, following months of delays.
All four opposition parties at Holyrood want to repeal the football act. But the Scottish government says it will not do so without a "viable alternative" being put in place. Lord Bracadale has now been asked by the government to ensure all of the country's hate crime legislation is fit for the 21st century. His independent review will start on 30 January, and is expected to last up to 12 months - after which the judge will present his recommendations to the Scottish government. His remit is to consider whether existing laws are the the most effective way of dealing with criminal conduct motivated by hatred, malice, ill-will or prejudice. It will consider the various hate crime offences currently covered by a range of different laws, including: Announcing the review in the Scottish Parliament, Community Safety Minister Annabelle Ewing said Scotland was an "open and inclusive nation", but was not immune from the threat of racism, intolerance and prejudice. She added: "While we already have robust and comprehensive laws in place, we need to make sure that legislation is up-to-date and able to counter all forms of hate crime. "This review will help ensure we have the right legislative protection in place to tackle hate crime wherever and whenever it happens. I look forward to Lord Bracadale presenting his findings." Lord Bracadale has been asked examine whether the scope of existing laws should be adjusted to reflect further aspects of religiously motivated offending. He was also tasked with looking at whether new categories of hate crime should be created for characteristics such as age and gender, which are not currently covered. And he will be asked to examine whether the existing laws can be simplified, and whether any "gaps, anomalies and inconsistencies" can be addressed. Lord Bracadale said: "Hate crime legislation has developed intermittently over many years and it is important to consider whether it currently provides appropriate, effective and consistent protection for Scottish communities". The review was welcomed by opposition politicians at Holyrood, who handed the Scottish government a symbolic defeat over the Offensive Behaviour at Football Act  in November. Conservative MSP Douglas Ross accused the Scottish government of "continuing to ignore the will of parliament" by refusing to scrap the act, which opponents claim is poorly written, unnecessary and unfairly targets football fans. Labour's Claire Baker told Ms Ewing: "We do not share her view that there is no viable alternative and I believe the review will recognise this." Ms Ewing said the Scottish government recognised the concerns raised over the law but will not repeal it without a "viable alternative", saying: "Such a move would take away protection from some of our most vulnerable communities." The majority SNP government passed the Offensive Behaviour at Football Act in 2012 as part of attempts to crack down on sectarianism and other anti-social behaviour at football matches.	The controversial Offensive Behaviour at Football Act is to be examined by a senior judge as part of a review of Scotland's hate crime laws.
The American city, linked to sportswear firm Nike, was given the event by the IAAF without a bidding process, a decision being investigated in France. Gothenburg, which missed out, described the process as "bad ethics". But Eugene said it "adhered to all ethical and legal standards for organizing, presenting and advocating for our bid, according to IAAF rules". Media playback is not supported on this device IAAF president and former vice-president Lord Coe severed his links to Nike after questions over his role in the decision. But in a statement Eugene said it had submitted identical bids for the 2019 and 2021 World Championships, losing out to Doha in 2019. It added: "The decision to award the 2021 World Championships to Eugene was made by the IAAF Council in a vote of 23-1." French officials are already investigating corruption allegations involving former IAAF president Lamine Diack, with Coe quitting the Nike payroll two days after a BBC story suggested he had held talks with Diack and Nike about the awarding of the 2021 event. Coe, who was reportedly paid £100,000 a year by Nike, said at the time that he "did not lobby anyone" over Eugene's bid, but simply "encouraged them to re-enter another bidding cycle as they had a strong bid". Gothenburg bid chief Bjorn Erikkson said awarding the World Championships to Eugene had made him "really upset and for very good reasons". He told BBC World Service: "What happened is bad ethics at least and definitely not professional. "In the worst of cases it's maybe also criminal, if somebody were there influencing the process, and that's a question that I really want a good answer to." The former police officer also said he was not sure if Gothenburg would re-enter the bidding process, should it be re-opened. "It's up to the Gothenburg people, they don't want to answer that question until they know why the last procedure was so unacceptable," he told BBC World Service. "If you are going to make business with these people you wish to know if they are professional, honest and serious, otherwise maybe you don't want to do business at all." Coe said that awarding a World Championships without a bidding process "was not without precedence" - the 2007 World Championships in Osaka was one such occasion. But Erikkson described that as "nonsense". He added: "If you behave idiotically and unacceptably is it better if you do it twice rather than once? Secondly there are no arguments for doing this, because we who are engaged in the sport wished to have a transparent process, to do it in disguise is not acceptable."	Eugene has defended its role in winning the right to host the 2021 World Championships.
The agreement, reached late on Friday after two days of talks in Brussels, gives the UK power to limit some EU migrants' benefits. It also includes a treaty change so the UK is not bound to "ever closer union" with other EU member states, he said. EU exit campaigners said the "hollow" deal offered only "very minor changes". Mr Cameron is set to the announce the date of a referendum on whether Britain should remain in the EU after a cabinet meeting which is happening at 10:00 GMT - the referendum is widely expected to be on Thursday, 23 June. Once the date is announced, ministers will be allowed to campaign for whichever side they want - one of Mr Cameron's closest political allies Michael Gove has already been named as supporting the Leave camp. Others, such as Iain Duncan Smith are expected to follow - but a question mark remains over which way London Mayor Boris Johnson will jump. The key points of the deal are: The prime minster had to make concessions to get a deal with the leaders of the 27 other EU members. Mr Cameron had originally wanted a complete ban on migrants sending child benefit abroad but had to compromise after some eastern European states rejected that and also insisted that existing claimants should continue to receive the full payment. On how long the UK would be able to have a four-year curb on in-work benefits for new arrivals,  Mr Cameron had to give way on hopes of it being in place for 13 years, settling for seven instead. The agreement on renegotiating the UK's EU membership was announced by European Council president Donald Tusk, who tweeted: "Deal. Unanimous support for new settlement for #UKinEU." German Chancellor Angela Merkel predicted the package of reforms would "elicit support in the UK for the country to remain in the EU". Mr Tusk said it "strengthens Britain's special status", while EU Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker described it as "fair". Mr Tusk added: "We didn't walk away from the negotiating table. We were willing to sacrifice part of our interests for the common good, to show our unity. "I deeply believe the UK needs Europe and Europe needs the UK. But the final decision is in the hands of the British people." The ink is hardly dry on the UK's EU deal, but immediately the focus has switched to the substance of what David Cameron has achieved and - possibly an awkward question - how many of his colleagues will argue against him. The focus will move to whether the prime minister can keep his party politely together during a period of public disagreement. The ability to restrict benefits to migrants is an important victory for Mr Cameron - ammunition for his argument that he has achieved changes to help reduce the number of EU migrants coming to live and work in the UK. The proposals are complicated and do not exactly match the promises he made in the Conservative Party manifesto. But with it - and the other commitments - it becomes harder for his critics to make the case that the agreement is flimsy and will change nothing. Read more from Laura Mr Cameron said he had achieved the reforms he wanted, claiming they would put the UK "in the driving seat" of one of the world's biggest markets and create a "more flexible" EU. "We have permanently protected the pound and our right to keep it," he added, saying that, for the first time, the EU "has explicitly acknowledged it has more than one currency". The prime minister said he had also protected Britain from further political integration inside the EU, adding: "Let me put this as simply as I can: Britain will never be part of a European superstate." Outlining his case to remain "in a reformed Europe", Mr Cameron said "turning our back on the EU is no solution at all". "We should be suspicious of those who claim that leaving Europe is an automatic fast-track to a land of milk and honey," he added. "The British people must now decide whether to stay in this reformed European Union or to leave. This will be a once-in-a-generation moment to shape the destiny of our country." Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn dismissed Mr Cameron's deal as a "sideshow" designed to "appease his opponents in the Conservative Party," adding that he had done nothing to protect jobs and fight low pay. "We will be campaigning to keep Britain in Europe in the coming referendum, regardless of David Cameron's tinkering, because it brings investment, jobs and protection for British workers and consumers," he said. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said it was now "more important than ever" that those who supported Scotland's continued EU membership made the case "as strongly as possible". Eurosceptics have dismissed the reforms, saying they will not allow the UK to block unwanted EU laws or reduce migration. Matthew Elliott, chief executive of the Vote Leave campaign, said Mr Cameron "will now declare victory but it is an entirely hollow one". UKIP leader Nigel Farage tweeted: "This is a truly pathetic deal. Let's Leave the EU, control our borders, run our own country and stop handing Â£55m every day to Brussels. I believe in Britain. We are good enough to be an independent, self-governing nation outside of the EU. This is our golden opportunity." As the EU summit was being concluded, another EU exit campaign, Grassroots Out, held a rally in Westminster. Conservative MP David Davis said it was time for Britain "to take  control of its own destiny", while UKIP leader Nigel Farage said the cross-party campaign was "absolutely united in fighting to get back our democracy". Mr Farage unveiled former Respect MP George Galloway as a "special guest" at the rally, describing him as a "towering figure on the left of British politics".	David Cameron says a deal struck with EU leaders will give the UK "special status" and he will campaign with his "heart and soul" to stay in the union.
The 30 gigabyte dump of stolen data appears to include nearly 200,000 emails belonging to Noel Biderman. Some experts have decided not to view the contents, but certain details are being distributed via Twitter. There has also been more fallout from the release of an earlier batch of data including Ashley Madison user emails. TrustedSec, a US security firm, has published a blog in which it verifies the basic details of the email data, released last week. The company says the files amount to 30 gigabytes' worth and regard 6,800 unique senders and 3,600 unique recipients. The veracity of the most recent data dump has also been confirmed by Norwegian security researcher Per Thorsheim, who was able to decompress the files. "I saw one email or two emails and I could verify the sender, the recipient, the domains and everything so it has to be an email from the CEO's mailbox," he told the BBC. "There's no doubt about that." However, Mr Thorsheim says that beyond verifying that the dump is real, he is not interested in reading the contents of the emails. Speaking to the BBC, the security firm hired by Ashley Madison to investigate the hack said it appeared to have been carried out through unusual means. "I can say that unlike many similar attacks, where a remote attacker has been able to use a security vulnerability such as an SQL [programming language] injection in order to dump data directly, that was not the case here," said Joel Eriksson, a security expert at Cycura. The Motherboard news site has published excerpts of several of the emails, which appear to contain discussions around Ashley Madison's security policy. "This hack affects potentially millions of people," journalist Joseph Cox told the BBC. "The massive email dump, which appears to be legitimate, gives some insight into what those who were in charge of the site really thought about security." One screenshot of the emails published by Motherboard reveals one employee's suggestion that news of a different social networking site being hacked could be "used as a PR spin". Meanwhile, users who have been linked to Ashley Madison by email addresses found in an earlier release of data have been the subject of uninvited scrutiny. Troy Hunt, who has been blogging about the implications of the hack, has described the case of church leader (who he chose not to identify) who had contacted a member of their own congregation, whose email address was linked to an Ashley Madison account. Hunt says that he has also received a "huge number of enquiries" from worried individuals who are concerned that they may be associated with Ashley Madison, whether or not they have actually created an account on the website themselves. "People are desperate to get the data," he told the BBC. "They're resorting to things that could get them into hot water, like trying to download the data themselves. "I don't think it's right for the individuals in the Ashley Madison database to have their personal lives put on display," he added. "Very often these people are entirely innocent." Mr Hunt and others have warned that users may be the subject of blackmail and extortion attempts. Indeed, security blogger Brian Krebs reported last week that spam emails demanding Bitcoin payments were targeting email addresses found in the Ashley Madison data. Although the implications of the data's release are still to be determined, some commentators are already pointing out that they could be far-reaching. Two law firms have launched a class action lawsuit against Ashley Madison in recent days, and it is possible that the plaintiffs would seek to use information from the chief executive's leaked emails to help build a case, according to Mark Watts, head of data protection at London law firm Bristows. "If the emails sent to/from the CEO are relevant to the case (ie to the class action) then I suspect that the lawyers involved would seek to rely upon them if they are helpful to the case," he told the BBC. Watts explained that even though the emails have been obtained illegally, any relevant correspondence to the case would probably have been discovered later anyway as part of the legal process. "Essentially, the claimants' lawyers would just be getting them early," he said.	A swathe of emails from the inbox of Ashley Madison's chief executive is now being scoured by a variety of security experts and journalists.
The agreement appears to bring to an end a bitter dispute between the coalition and the Afghan government. The troops and their Afghan counterparts have been accused of murder and intimidation in the area. Special forces and local police will now begin a phased withdrawal. Afghan security forces will then take over on a district-by-district basis. American special forces and the Afghan local police they have trained in Wardak have been accused of committing atrocities in the area, including the murder of nine men. Isaf has denied the allegations but President Hamid Karzai last month said they should withdraw within a fortnight. Relations between the president and Nato have been tense in recent weeks. On Tuesday the presidential spokesman described the Nato-led military operation in Afghanistan as "aimless and unwise". "We have come to agreement on a plan for Wardak that continues the transition of this critical province and meets the security needs of the people and the requirements of our mission," Isaf Commander Gen Joseph Dunford said. "Under the agreement, beginning with Nerkh District, which is currently secured by Afghan Local Police (ALP) aided by coalition forces, the Afghan government will soon move Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) into this area to provide security. "The arrival of the ANSF will preclude the need for ALP and coalition forces in this area. The remainder of the province will transition over time." The general said that the agreement reflected the "growing capacity and capability of the Afghan security forces to meet the security needs" of Afghanistan. The BBC's Quentin Sommerville in Kabul says that the agreement is short on specifics - no timetable has been reached on when the special forces will leave. But it does allow Mr Karzai to save face. Afghan defence ministry spokesman Gen Zahir Azimi said that the Afghan army "will take the lead" after international special forces withdraw from Nerkh district, "so this problem will be solved within a few days". However our correspondent says that it is far from certain that the already stretched Afghan special forces will be able to establish security in Wardak once Nato has left. Wardak is a critical province. Located near Kabul, it has been used as staging post for a number of large-scale attacks in the city and has been the recent focus of counter-insurgency operations. The accountability of US forces and local militia working with them has been a growing source of friction in Afghan-US relations. Wednesday's agreement comes against a backdrop of long-term negotiations over which foreign forces will remain in Afghanistan after Nato's exit in 2014. The bulk of Nato's 100,000 troops are due to leave by the end of that year.	An agreement has been reached between Nato and the Afghan government on the withdrawal of US special forces from Wardak province, alliance officials have announced.
The 24-year-old summer signing injured himself in training on Friday as he went to take a shot and will see a consultant this week. He joins Ryan Brunt and left-back Gary Sawyer as long-term absentees. "It's a huge blow, any players we have in the squad that are injured is very disappointing for us," manager Derek Adams told BBC Radio Devon. Spencer had become first choice in the central striking role of the League Two leaders following an injury to on-loan Bristol City forward Paul-Arnold Garita, who has just returned to fitness. "He and Garita have played in that area this season and held the ball up and performed well for us," Adams added following Saturday's 3-0 home loss to Grimsby. "It's hard to take as a manager because you feel that you're getting somewhere and then something happens, it's like a roadblock, it's very difficult to overcome these things, so it's hard to take."	Plymouth Argyle striker Jimmy Spencer will miss at least three months after breaking and dislocating his ankle.
The incident occurred on Great Northern Road near to its junction with Clifton Road at about 12:00 on Saturday. Police Scotland has appealed for witnesses to the crash. Police said the collision involved a black Yamaha motorcycle, a black Vauxhall Adam and a silver Volkswagen Caravelle. Sgt Malcolm Kinross, of Police Scotland's divisional road policing unit, said: "Our thoughts at this difficult time are with the family and friends of Damian Piotrowski. "We continue to investigate the circumstances of this collision and we are appealing for anyone who was in the area at the time to come forward. "In particular, we are keen to speak to passing motorists in a white Vauxhall Insignia and a dark coloured Nissan Qashqai who may have witnessed the collision."	A 27-year-old motorcyclist who died following a three-vehicle crash in Aberdeen has been named by police as Damian Piotrowski.
BBC Northern Ireland is planning to move from its premises at Broadcasting House on Ormeau Avenue. The corporation has yet to decide on a site. The council has set out its preferred options for the broadcaster in its regeneration and investment strategy. It said lands to the rear of Belfast Central Library, a site north of Great Patrick Street or the stalled Royal Exchange development could all be suitable. It has recommended that a working group involving the BBC, the council, the universities and other agencies should be formed. The Ulster University is currently building a major extension to its Belfast campus on the northern edge of the city centre. Adjacent streets are also due to be redeveloped as part of the Northside scheme. The council strategy expresses hope that a major department store, such as John Lewis, will anchor the Royal Exchange development. But it states that if the retail option is not possible the BBC "would be an obvious candidate" as an anchor tenant. The BBC has previously been linked with a move to Titanic Quarter or as part of the redevelopment of Great Victoria Street station. The council's strategy also contains details of its Â£19m city centre investment fund. It could be used to make loan or equity funding to developments or for the council to buy development sites.	Belfast City Council has said a BBC relocation to a site beside the Ulster University campus would lead to a "comprehensive transformation" of that part of the city.
Starr, a former independent counsel, was the author of what's probably the most expensive piece of pornography ever published, the Starr Report which chronicled, in graphic sexual detail, Bill Clinton's affair with a 21-year-old White House intern, Monica Lewinsky. The one-time character assassin has become a character witness. Bill Clinton, despite being impeached for lying under oath about that affair, left office with the highest approval rating - 66% - of any departing president. He was also credited with balancing the federal budget and reviving the American economy from its early-Nineties slump. Since then, as Starr noted, he has followed a redemptive path. So he should be a prime asset to his wife Hillary as she seeks to become the first ever first lady to move from the East Wing of the White House to the West. The irony of Starr's kind words is that they have come at a time when Hillary, among other woes, has a Bill problem. The man who could well become the "First Dude" - Hillary's words, not mine - is proving to be something of a liability. Part of it stems, of course, from what eventually became the focus of Kenneth Starr's inquiry, Bill Clinton's womanising. It blunts her attacks on Donald Trump's sexism and misogyny which, in a contest where more women will vote than men, should have been her ace card. The billionaire, in a jujutsu-like move, has already launched an attack ad featuring video of Kathleen Willey, who accused Bill Clinton of sexual assault, and Juanita Broaddrick, who accused him of rape. "DIRTY BILLS," read the front page of the New York Post the following day, conflating Trump's attack ad with the allegations against Bill Cosby. Nor is Trump relying on guilt by association. He has already called Hillary an "enabler" of her husband's fidelity. "She would go after these women and destroy their lives," he has claimed. Like many of Trump's attacks, that may strike many voters as shrill and overstated, it also contains a kernel of truth. The White House did attempt to trash Monica Lewinsky when the scandal first erupted in 1998, and Hillary Clinton, during her husband's long phase of public denial, described it as being the product of a "vast right-wing conspiracy", absolving him of blame. Hillary as loyal "stand-by-your-man" wife does not marry that well with Hillary as feminist trailblazer, the image she is trying to project. My sense, having watched the Clintons fairly closely for over 20 years, is that they have a loving marriage and deep friendship. An animated conversation that started at Yale Law School in the early Seventies continues for both of them to fascinate and enthral. But many critics of the Clintons believe it's a transactional partnership, a marriage of political convenience. To some, her loyalty during the most troubled phase of the Clinton presidency reinforces the sense that she's a cynical political operator, willing to do anything to accrue power. The Bernie problem, her difficulty in seeing off her Democratic rival, is also partly a Bill problem. The unexpected success of the Vermont Senator is explained not only by an aversion to Hillary but also a rejection of Bill. Sanders supporters are railing against his political and policy legacy. Bill Clinton's pursuit of a "Third Way" politics was designed to make the Democrats more electable and to end the party's losing streak in presidential politics. Up until his victory in 1992, they had only won one of the previous six elections. But this shift to the middle ground, and the centrist policies that accompanied it, alienated many on the Democrat left. Withholding support from Hillary Clinton and bestowing it instead upon Bernie Sanders is a form of revenge. Whether its financial deregulation, the welfare bill that Clinton passed with the Republican-controlled Congress, criminal justice reforms which have contributed to higher levels of black incarceration, the North American Free Trade Agreement, or Nafta for short, there's been an angry backlash against what Clinton once trumpeted as some of his greatest domestic accomplishments. This has made her vulnerable to a challenge from the left, as Sanders has shown. But it also makes her vulnerable to a challenge from the right, because of Nafta. Blue-collar voters, who might ordinarily be expected to vote Democrat, stand to applaud when Donald Trump promises to renegotiate trade deals which have exported American jobs abroad. Hillary Clinton hinted recently that Bill would become her jobs tsar and focus his energies on reviving American manufacturing. She clearly hopes that he can appeal again to blue-collar whites, who warmed to him as a candidate and president. But that bond has been severely eroded, if not severed completely, because he was the president who negotiated Nafta. Public perceptions about Bill Clinton have also changed, in a way which exposes the rupture between the Democratic establishment and the Democratic grassroots. When he first appeared on the national scene, he could plausibly cast himself as the boy from Hope, his small-town Arkansas birthplace. Now, after all the millions he has earned on the international speaking circuit, he comes across not just as a limousine liberal but a Lear Jet liberal. Standing at the head of a metropolitan progressive elite, he does not have the same common touch of old. The Clintons, after all these years as the dominant power couple in the Democratic establishment, also project an imperious sense of entitlement. It explains why Hillary Clinton's email scandal cuts so deep. It reinforces the widespread view that the couple believe they are not bound by normal rules. Are Trump and Sanders right about trade? Why is the US turning to protectionism? Trump, Clinton and the 'None of the Above' era Hillary Clinton's problem with women Those of us who have watched him on the campaign trail have also been surprised at the 69-year-old's comparative lack of energy.  The magnetism and charisma for which he is famed simply is not there. At a rally in New Hampshire, I happened to be stood next to Clinton's biographer David Maraniss, whose real-time Twitter feed made for fascinating reading. "When BC was introduced and stood on stage w/Chelsea, he showed nothing on his face, mouth agape, eyes seemingly blank... just frail, like he had to conserve every ounce of energy. No gleam in his eyes, no electricity, mutedâ€¦. He lit up only when Chelsea talked about him. Then when it was his turn to talk a little bit of his old self came back, but not much." Once the most powerful energy force in any room, Bill Clinton is now only an ambient presence. The former president is not without his fans. There are thousands who still cheer this self-proclaimed architect of the bridge to the 21st Century. What's also been striking is how African-American voters have returned to the Clinton fold, after backing Barack Obama in 2008, despite protesters from the Black Lives Matters campaign targeting him on the stump. However, the former first couple's hopes that wistful memories of the Clinton administration would lead to a Clinton restoration have surely dwindled. Nostalgia is something that can give a departing president a warm glow, as Barack Obama is presently discovering, but hard for a presidential aspirant to harness, especially when so much of the country is angrily demanding change.	Adding another unanticipated sidebar to this topsy-turvy election, Kenneth Starr has lavished praise on Bill Clinton, citing his "genuine empathy for human beings", calling him "the most gifted politician of the baby boomer generation" and commending his post-presidential philanthropy, which he noted was Carteresque in its benevolence.

Jordan Maguire-Drew nearly put the Daggers in front early on when he struck the woodwork while at the other end, Ryan Bird did the same with a header as the sides sparred. In the second half, Matt Robinson threaded a through-pass to Whitely, who controlled and dispatched under Ryan Clarke with the confidence of a striker - a goal that ended an impressive 10-match unbeaten run for the hosts. Whitely could have put a greater gloss on matters for John Still's side, but he struck the bar from 20 yards. Report supplied by the Press Association. Match ends, Eastleigh 0, Dagenham and Redbridge 1. Second Half ends, Eastleigh 0, Dagenham and Redbridge 1. Substitution, Eastleigh. James Constable replaces Ryan Bird. Substitution, Eastleigh.

First-team coach Andy Smith, goalkeeping coach Marco Tabuas and fitness coach Maykel Moreira have now also left Vale Park, the League One club has confirmed. The three all arrived when Ribeiro was appointed in the summer. "We thank them for their time with us," a club statement said. "They helped assist the club to their best home start to a season ever at Vale Park and progression to the FA Cup third round." Vale face a home game with Chesterfield on Friday before a trip to Oldham on Monday, prior to playing Championship side Huddersfield Town in the FA Cup on 7 January, They have lost their last three league games to slip to 17th in the table - just six points above the relegation zone. Ribeiro's former assistant, Michael Brown, has been placed in temporary charge of the Burslem-based club.	Port Vale have parted company with three of their backroom staff after manager Bruno Ribeiro's Boxing Day departure.
The district council-owned building has been upgraded for the first time in more than three decades. It includes a new 33m pool, a shallow training pool, sauna and steam room. The sports hall has been revamped and a £250,000 climbing wall has been built at the Bridgefoot centre. The double Olympic gold medallist said: "It's an amazing venue for these guys so that they can learn a life skill as well as having fun. "So many pools nowadays through this whole country have been knocked down and it's incredible that they've invested the money back to make a safe place." It is the second time Adlington has visited the centre after she opened the temporary pool provided as part of the British Gas 'Pools for Schools Programme' earlier this year. Other athletes who joined the celebrations included water polo player, Rosie Morris, who competed as the GB goalkeeper at the London Olympics in 2012. Zoe Reeve, former member of the GB Synchro Squad and triple Commonwealth Gold Medallist and three-time Olympian James Goddard also attended the event.	Olympic swimming champion Rebecca Adlington has unveiled a £5m refurbishment of Stratford Leisure Centre.
The rail operator said recruiting trainees at depots across the country would support the expansion of timetables and roll-out "faster, bigger and greener" trains. The roles will be based in Aberdeen, Ayr, Bathgate, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Gourock, Helensburgh, Inverness, Perth, Stirling and Tweedbank. Train drivers' union Aslef welcomed the announcement. Trainees will be paid £24,559 during their first year. This will gradually increase to £43,212, following a probationary period. ScotRail Alliance managing director Phil Verster said: "We're investing in Scotland's railways by modernising trains, expanding timetables and adding journey options - and recruiting a large group of new drivers is vital to make these improvements possible. "We are proud to be supporting local communities and the Scottish economy by creating quality jobs that will make a real impact for customers." ScotRail said it wanted to hear from "enthusiastic, reliable candidates with excellent attention spans, experience of safety-critical roles and a passion for customer service". Scottish Transport Minister Derek Mackay said: "The Scottish government is investing record levels in Scotland's railways with a £5bn package to upgrade trains, track and services across the country. "Key investment in infrastructure, such as the recent historic reopening of the Borders Railway and our substantial programme of electrification, are only part of the story. "The staff who keep our railways running are a key asset and I am delighted to launch this unprecedented, nationwide recruitment drive that will create up to 100 new train driver jobs." Kevin Lindsay, Scottish secretary of Aslef, said: "This is a great opportunity for all sections of our community to apply to join the railway. "As a union, we look forwarded to continuing our good working relationship with the Scottish government and Abellio as we jointly develop and deliver Scotland's railways."	ScotRail has announced plans to recruit up to 100 new train drivers.
Orla Galton, from Blackmill, Bridgend county, was diagnosed with leukaemia at three and blood transfusions helped save her life. She endured them for years, but her mother, Sharon, said they were a lifeline. The Welsh Blood Service wants 200,000 more donors to replenish stocks. "When Orla was having chemotherapy her bloods hit so low that she became anaemic, she would have no white blood cells so she couldn't fight any infection," she said told BBC Radio Wales. "It's quite a dangerous time as while their bloods are going down, they can't carry on with the treatment. Orla needed blood transfusions so she could keep having the chemotherapy." Orla, who has now been given the all clear, paid tribute to the donors who helped her. "I would just like to say thank you," she said. "I can't thank you more." The Welsh Blood Service said:	A 12-year-old cancer survivor has urged more people to give blood, as the number of new donors has dropped by 40% over the past decade.
One of the men was arrested in the capital Berlin and the other in a town close to Cologne, in west Germany. Police seized computers, mobile phones and sketches in the raids but did not find a "smoking gun", prosecutors' spokesman Martin Steltner said. About 450 officers were involved in the raids. One of the men detained, reported to be aged 35, had been living in a refugee shelter in the town of Attendorn, east of Cologne, and is wanted by the Algerian authorities for alleged links to IS. Police said "investigations show that he has been trained militarily in Syria". The man's wife, also wanted by Algeria, was detained at the same time but prosecutors said she was not a suspect in the German case. The suspect held in Berlin was arrested on suspicion of falsifying identity documents, police said. Two other Algerians in Germany, said by police to be "from the jihadist scene", were tracked down but not arrested. "Our understanding is that the four men accused could have planned to carry out an attack together," Mr Steltner said. German media said the possible targets included central Berlin tourist sites Checkpoint Charlie and Alexanderplatz. Since January, the suspects had changed their mobile phones multiple times and communicated using instant messaging services, reports said. Germany's security concerns have risen since the Paris attacks last year. Officials declined to comment on a report in the Tagesspiegel newspaper, citing security sources, which said senior IS figures had ordered an attack on Germany.	German police have arrested two Algerians suspected of planning an attack and having links to the militant group, Islamic State (IS).
The girl band was due to play a matinee and evening show at the SSE Arena on Thursday. The cancellation was announced just minutes after the doors opened for the afternoon performance. Fans were later informed by text message that the show would not be going ahead as scheduled. Michael Green was in Belfast for the concert with his daughters, aged five and six. He said the family had been among fans who were disappointed when One Direction re-scheduled their Belfast concert last October. Mr Green told the BBC he felt "physically gutted and a little bit sick" when he was told the kids were to be let down again. "I thought this couldn't happen again, what are the chances?" Michael had surprised his daughters with the tickets on Christmas morning and travelled from Coleraine to see the girl band. He said he was worried the band would re-schedule for an afternoon when the children were back at school. "I'm really, really annoyed. Once again they've waited until we got here to tell us it was cancelled." Mother Geraldine McLaughlin had brought her stepdaughter, Stacey, to the concert for her birthday. She said the 16-year-old's birthday had been ruined by the news. "We came down to Belfast and booked into the Ramada to make a day of it," she said. "Stacey was so excited about this, I don't know what we'll do for the rest of the day. "We're just going to go back to the hotel now to get away from this chaos." Thousands of young people were gathered at the SSE Arena at lunchtime on Thursday when the announcement was made via speakerphone. Ms McLaughlin said many of them were in tears. "It's not been handled very well," she said. "There's absolute bedlam down here now. "Surely they could have informed us before we all landed at the place? This was minutes before the show was due to begin." A statement from gig promoter Aikens said: "We regret to announce that both Little Mix shows at the SSE Arena will not take place today due to Jesy being unwell and not able to perform. "Please hold on to your tickets - we hope to be able to make a further announcement on possible rescheduling later today." Ms McLaughlin pointed out that if the concert is rescheduled for next week, children will be back at school. "You can't just take a day off school and time off work for a concert," she said. Mother Sarah-Louise Murray had tickets for her and her three-year-old daughter, Scarlett, to see the band on Thursday afternoon. She said Scarlett had been in tears when she was told the concert was not going ahead. "We had special matching T-shirts made for the day and she was so looking forward to it. "We arrived after 13:00 when the doors were due to open because I wanted to avoid the crowds, but when we got to the arena the queues of people were still waiting outside. "When we heard from others that it was cancelled I put Scarlett back in the pram and told her we had to go home and come back another day." It is the second major cancellation to disappoint young music fans in the city in recent times. Last October, One Direction called off a gig at the SSE at late notice after singer Liam Payne became ill.	The band Little Mix have been forced to cancel their Belfast gigs after singer Jesy Nelson became unwell.
Members of the city council's transport and environment committee agreed on Tuesday a traffic regulation order enabling the charges. It is now planned to introduce the 20mph network over six phases. Phase one of the Â£2.2m project covers much of the city centre, from Queen Street to the Meadows. Lesley Hinds, Edinburgh city council's transport convener, said: "The aim was to create safer, more attractive streets for all road users." The limit, which will eventually cover 80% of the capital's roads. The roll out will be complete by 2018. The scheme is designed to improve safety and encourage more people to walk or cycle. Despite the change, speed limits on key arterial routes into the city will remain at 30 or 40mph. About 50% of the city's roads are already 20mph. Phase two of the project, in the north of the city, is due to begin in October. Phase three is to start in February 2017, then phase four in June 2017, phase five in October 2017 and phase six in February 2018.	Edinburgh is closer to becoming the country's first 20mph city after councillors approved plans to begin rolling out the speed limit.
Entertainers Starkidz were "cornered" by the gang after a Christmas lights switch-on in Formby, Merseyside. The performers, including one as young as 13, were abused, with one punched and another threatened with an airgun, said the troupe's manager Jan Hayes. "We may not return to Formby next year," she said. "We've been going for five years and we have never had any trouble like this. "It started off with these teenagers trying take their hats or telling the children they are not real elves. "Later on, a gang of about 20 cornered our group and one member was punched in the stomach as they were abused." Ms Hayes said the one of the performers had an airgun held to his head. "It was a very traumatic experience," she added. "The group member is extremely upset by this." The elves have received dozens of messages of support via social media from parents. One local mother, Nicola Cowie, said: "Starkidz bring so much to our community, they bring magic to life. "Her Elves give it their all, they live and breath as elves while they're dressed in those costumes. I'd be so disgusted if my child acted they way those youths did." A Merseyside Police spokesman said it was investigating a report of anti-social behaviour by a group of youths at the event.	A group of performing Christmas elves has been left "traumatised" after being attacked by a gang of teenagers.
Trevor O'Neill was shot outside a supermarket in Majorca just after 21:00 local time on Wednesday, Irish national broadcaster RTÃ‰ reports. His shooting is understood to be linked to a feud between Irish criminal gangs. Mr O'Neill's partner and three children, aged five, seven and 10, were with him when the attack happened. They had travelled to Majorca on Saturday for a holiday for his 40th birthday. Police believe the attack was connected to a dispute between the Hutch and Kinahan groups, but Mr O'Neill was not the intended victim. The feud between the gangs was sparked by the killing of Dubliner Gary Hutch in Spain last year and most of the resulting violence and murders have happened in Dublin. Attempts to revive Mr O'Neill at the scene failed and police are said to be searching for up to three suspects. It is understood that he was not linked to organised crime but may have been talking to a member of the Hutch family at the time.	An Irishman who was shot dead on a Spanish island is believed to have been killed in a case of mistaken identity in a gang-related attack.
London turned down the chance to host the Grand Depart, citing the cost of staging the event - reported to be about £35m - as the reason. It will be the first time since West Berlin in 1987 that Germany has hosted the opening stage of road cycling's premier race. La Manche in north-west France will host the 2016 Grand Depart. This 2015 event started in the Dutch city of Utrecht, a year after thousands came to Leeds to watch the cyclists set off.	The 2017 Tour de France will begin in the German city of Dusseldorf, it has been announced.
The Cheetahs and Kings are set to enter the league for the coming season, which begins in early September. The pair meet in their final Super Rugby fixture on 14 July, leaving scant opportunity for rest and preparation. "They're not having a break at the end of a strenuous Super Rugby season," Solomons told BBC Scotland. "They're going into a competition that is literally nine months. It'll be brutal for them. That is massive. "Players are very, very well-conditioned today, so the collisions are mighty. I think that is brutal and the logistics, in my opinion - they will have to play away from home for about three weeks at a time. "They'll have to come out on a three-week tour and play a block of games together. And then sides coming to South Africa will have to play both [South African] sides." The Cheetahs and Kings are expected to be cut from Super Rugby by the South African Rugby Union on Friday 7 July as the tournament is reduced from 18 to 15 teams. The expanded Pro12 may be split into two seven-team conferences, which would likely reduce the number of fixtures and volume of travel required. South African Solomons, 66, says spending long periods overseas would handicap the new additions. Media playback is not supported on this device "You're not practising and living at home - that's the disadvantage," he said. "You're not sleeping in your own bed in your own home environment. "The South African sides are at a distinct disadvantage, there's no question about that. "But I think we have always felt like we were at a disadvantage geographically in Super Rugby and had to travel more than the others - there's little you can do about it. "Your first game when you go to New Zealand is very difficult, because you're knackered. It takes about 10 days to acclimatise. "And now, with the teams going across to the UK, there is no change of time zone. "It's an overnight trip. There will be a bit of jet-fatigue but no jet-lag. I think what is going to fatigue them is doing it multiple times. That has never been done before. They may reduce the number of trips, but it's still going to be brutal." Solomons has coached the Kings and Stormers in his homeland, as well as assisting Nick Mallett with the national side and working as a high performance consultant for the game's global governing body, World Rugby. North of the equator, he has led Ulster, Northampton Saints and Edinburgh, whom he left after three years in September 2016, and spent the second half of last season with Bristol in a consultancy role. The veteran coach believes both franchises would adapt well to their new league. "Knowing the Pro12, both those teams as they are operating at the moment are well capable of being competitive," he said. "The Pro12 has always been a cross-border competition - none of the nations could have their own domestic competition because they don't have sufficient playing numbers within their countries. "I think it is a natural fit to have the Kings and the Cheetahs come in from a cross-border perspective. I think there will be benefit to both parties. "It will be marvellous for [the existing Pro12 teams] to travel to South Africa and compete in a completely different environment. "I do think there will be good support for the Cheetahs and the Kings - certainly there will be bigger television audiences and I think that'll help [the Pro12]. "Hopefully, there will be more money coming into everyone's coffers due to increased broadcast revenues and the competition itself will generate better revenue, which will help with the travel."	South African inductees to the Pro12 face a "brutal" transition from Super Rugby, former Edinburgh head coach Alan Solomons has warned.
Maj Gen James Johnston was faced with 40,000 prisoners at the Bergen-Belsen camp and set up a hospital to treat them for typhus, TB and starvation. His son, Anthony Johnston, said: "He had to deal with people dying by the hundreds every day." The plaque was unveiled in Northiam, East Sussex where Gen Johnston lived. Born in Glasgow, he moved to the village with his family in 1973. About 60 people, including members of Gen Johnston's family, gathered for the unveiling at the pump house on the village green. Gen Johnston was commanding a mobile medical unit close to the German-Dutch border in April 1945. He was ordered to move his unit to take charge of the sick and starving at Bergen-Belsen, which had just been liberated by the British. Around 70,000 people had died at the camp in northern Germany. Mr Johnston said his father had been reluctant to talk about his World War Two experiences, due to modesty and wanting to block out such a traumatic event. "There were times in his life when former inmates, who he had come across at the time, got in touch with him and wanted to acknowledge him," Mr Johnston said. "Other than that, he didn't talk about it." In an account which is now in the Holocaust Museum in Washington, Gen Johnston wrote: "Little did I know that I was about to be faced with the greatest test of my career, with a situation that would remain engraved on my memory for the rest of my days. "[It] would instil in me a lasting abhorrence not only of those who had perpetrated this crime on humanity, but also of those who had condoned it."	A plaque has been unveiled in memory of an Army medical officer who treated prisoners at a German concentration camp in 1945 following its liberation.
Tall and like football? Go and play centre-back. Enjoy rugby union and have a bit of pace? Winger. Step forward Somerset's Dom Bess, who took 6-28 on his County Championship debut on Tuesday. How did he come to bowl off-spin? "I was always a little porker when I was younger, so I never took the long run-up," he said. "I always took five or six steps and just trotted in." Bess now has the best figures by a Somerset debutant for 55 years, since Tony Pearson returned 7-63 against Worcestershire in 1961, according to the Guardian. But any 'puppy fat' the 19-year-old may have had has long gone, with the help of strength and conditioning coach Darren Veness. "I met Daz and he made me run a lot, which I'm grateful for now," Bess told BBC Radio Bristol. "Ask Daz about me, I was always a porker." Just a month ago Bess, from Sidmouth, was taking 6-65 for Devon in the Minor Counties Championship as they lost to bottom-of-the-table Oxfordshire. At Taunton, however, his victims included Ian Bell and Jonathan Trott, who have played a combined total of 170 Tests for England. His family have a strong presence in the sport, with cousins Zac and Josh also representing Devon, but who was at the County Ground to watch his moment of glory? "Dad was on holiday and mum was working, so I just had my girlfriend, her parents and a couple of my mates (watching)," he said. "I think dad will be a bit disappointed - he's gone to Greece, somewhere like that, for a week away."	Whether it comes down to skill level, body shape, or pure accident, anyone who has played a sport will have some memory of how they came to be given a particular role.
Research suggest animals that build their nests in early spring may win the fight for available habitat at the expense of late breeders. Conservation efforts should focus on ensuring rare species have enough places to nest, say scientists. For example, areas could be left to grow wild between spring and summer to help bumblebees establish nests. Habitats such as hedgerows and hay meadows are being lost in many countries, meaning that fewer nesting sites are available. Competition among animals for a suitable place to nest could explain why some species are struggling to survive. "Ecologists understand why some groups of species are declining more, such as why farmland species are declining more than woodland species," said Dr Andrew Higginson of the University of Exeter. "But an enduring mystery is the big variation in the declines of closely related species. Fighting over nest sites may be part of the reason - when nest sites are hard to come by, the species that will suffer most are those that nest later in the year." The University of Exeter study analysed population changes in more than 200 bird species and 40 bumblebee species around the world. The population data was combined with a mathematical model that used game theory to predict the likely behaviour of bees and birds when faced with competition for nesting sites. It calculated the implications of fighting for nesting sites, based on the size of each species, the time of nesting and the quality of the nesting site. The study found larger species that nest early generally do better, while smaller bees and birds that nest later in the year lose out in the struggle for habitat. For example, the chaffinch is doing well in the UK, while the goldfinch is on the decline. "We need to have a more holistic approach to providing good habitat for animals," Dr Higginson told BBC News. "We need to worry about the whole life cycle not just what they eat." He said conservation efforts for animals such as birds and bees tend to focus on providing food. Restoration and provision of nest sites should be an urgent priority, he said. This could be as simple as waiting to cut hedgerows until later in the year when all animals have nested or providing more boxes for birds to nest in. The research is published in the journal, Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology. Follow Helen on  Twitter.	Competition for nesting sites could explain why some birds and bumblebees are declining faster than others.
Spurs, who are having a new £400m stadium built next to their existing home White Hart Lane, could also play next season's home Champions League games at the national stadium. They aim to move into their new 61,000-seat home before the 2018-19 season. "We're a long way down the path on reaching an agreement," Dyke said. "I think there's some discussion about whether they'll play their Champions League games there at Wembley next year but I don't know much about that." Tottenham's north-London rivals Arsenal hosted Champions League games at Wembley in 1998-99 and 1999-2000. Dyke also said Chelsea could play home games at Wembley in the near future. The Blues have plans to redevelop Stamford Bridge, which could leave them needing a temporary home for several seasons. "I think Chelsea might come for a longer period," he told Sky Sports News HQ. "Chelsea have got really exciting plans for their stadium. They're going to demolish the whole thing and build a whole new stadium on the existing site. "If they came to Wembley, that would mean them coming for three years."	Tottenham are close to a deal to play home games at Wembley in the 2017-18 season, says Football Association chairman Greg Dyke.
The teenager was walking on the Ancrum Road crossing, near the junction with Ancrum Drive, when she was hit by a black Ford Fiesta at about 17:20 on Monday. She is receiving treatment at Ninewells Hospital. Police Scotland have appealed for witnesses to contact them.

Despite calling it a "gimmick", Labour backed the Charter for Budget Responsibility, saying it was "fully consistent" with its approach. But as the parties clashed over spending plans, Chancellor George Osborne said Labour would create "a tax bombshell or a borrowing bombshell". Earlier, the Institute for Fiscal Studies said voters faced a "stark choice" between the parties. When the charter was unveiled by the government in December, it prompted a row between the Tories and Labour over their spending plans, with both sides accusing each other of shifting their deficit reduction targets. It commits the government to a goal of balancing day-to-day spending - the structural current deficit - by 2017-18. It would also ensure that debt is falling as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 2016-17. The Treasury says that to meet these targets a new government would have to make additional tax rises or spending cuts of around £30bn - more than Labour plans. But Labour says the targets match its plans to eradicate the current deficit "as soon as possible" in the next parliament. In the Commons, Mr Osborne said the government had neither gone faster nor slower than it said it would on deficit reduction, and said Labour would borrow more than the Conservatives after 2015. But Mr Balls said Mr Osborne had "flat lined" the economy and missed his target to balance the books in 2015-16. Lib Dem Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander criticised Labour's record but added that the Conservative Party's plan to eliminate the deficit with spending cuts alone was "grossly unfair". "Taxes on the wealthy should, and must, play a significant part," he added. Mr Osborne referred to comments by the IFS that a future Labour government could add £170bn to the national debt by 2030 based on its spending plans. IFS director Paul Johnson said Labour's plan to ease spending cuts could require borrowing of up to £50bn a year more by 2020 than the Conservatives. This could hamper the UK's ability to cope with a future recession, he said. The Conservatives have pledged to balance the government's overall spending, covering current and capital spending, while Labour has promised to balance day-to-day spending but borrow for investment. In an analysis of the parties' plans for government, Mr Johnson said voters faced a stark choice between the two parties. He said the Tories planned to scale back public spending by at least £33bn, while Labour planned cuts of £7bn. "Lest there be any doubt, there is a big difference between £7bn of cuts and £33bn of cuts," he said. "If you take the plans set out in the autumn statement at face value, spending cuts of more than £50bn could be required after 2015-16." And the economist sounded a warning about the long-term risks of adding to the nation's debt. "The problem is that another recession will strike one day. Going into a new recession with debt still high - and it is higher now than at any time since the late 1960s - could leave less room for manoeuvre. "The sort of additional borrowing that we are able to support as we made our way through the recent period might not be as easily financed." Mr Johnson said that even if Labour kept cuts to a minimum in the next Parliament, further tax rises or spending cuts "might prove necessary down the line to reduce risks with the long-term state of the public finances further". Labour dismissed the IFS's prediction as being based on a "ludicrous assumption" about what it would do beyond 2020. A spokesman said: "Labour will cut the deficit every year and get the current budget into surplus, and national debt as a share of GDP falling, as soon as possible in the next parliament." Mr Johnson, director of the economic think-tank, also warned that the spending cuts proposed by the Conservatives would be tough to deliver. David Cameron has committed his party to running an overall budget surplus by the end of the next Parliament through a combination of cutting spending and waste, rather than tax rises. In a speech on Monday, Mr Cameron warned against passing on a "legacy of debt" to future generations. Mr Johnson said: "Under the Autumn Statement plans, Conservatives could be cutting unprotected budgets by 26% after 2015-16 - or an extraordinary 41% over the period from 2010. "Even just to meet their more modest fiscal target, these budgets would need to be cut by more than 15% after 2015/16. "Labour would need to implement cuts of just 3%."	MPs have voted in favour of setting new binding targets on public spending.
The win would normally be an indicator of Oscar success as the Directors Guild recipient nearly always goes on to claim the same prize at Hollywood's biggest night. But Affleck missed out on an Oscar directing nomination. "I don't think that this makes me a real director, but I think it means I'm on my way," said Affleck of the win. In Argo, set amidst the 1979 Iranian hostage crisis, Affleck also plays the lead role of a CIA agent entrusted with extracting six Americans from the country after the US embassy was stormed. While Affleck was overlooked by the Academy for his directing role, the film has dominated other awards since the Oscar nominations, winning best director and best film at the Golden Globes and at the Critics Choice Awards. Last weekend, Argo was victorious at both the Producers Guild and the Screen Actors Guild awards, leaving Steven Spielberg's Civil War-era epic Lincoln in its wake. Many of the film professionals who vote in guild awards also cast ballots for the Oscars, so recognition from the DGA further seals Argo's status as best-picture front-runner at the Oscars on 24 February. Only six times in the DGA's history has the winner failed to take the Oscar for best director. This will be the seventh, as Affleck missed out on an Academy nomination, along with several other key favourites, including fellow Directors Guild contenders Kathryn Bigelow for Zero Dark Thirty and Tom Hooper for Les Miserables. Backstage at the DGA ceremony on Saturday, Affleck said he had nothing but respect for the Academy, adding that "you're not entitled to anything." "I'm thrilled and honoured that the Academy nominated me as a producer of the movie," he said. "I know our movie, we're a little bit underdog and a little bit the little engine that could, and you take me out of it maybe helps ... it's just about that picture. I feel like it's OK, I'm really lucky, I'm in a good place." Among the other DGA winners were Searching for Sugar Man director Malik Bendjelloul, who won the guild's documentary award for his study of the obscure singer-songwriter Sixto Rodriquez. The film also is nominated for best documentary at the Oscars. Lena Dunham won the TV comedy directing prize for Girls, about the lives of a group of girls in their 20s, while Rian Johnson won in the drama series series category for Breaking Bad. Milos Forman, who directed One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and Amadeus, was honoured with a lifetime-achievement award. The 65th Annual DGA Awards, hosted by Kelsey Grammer, were held at the Ray Dolby Ballroom at Hollywood & Highland in Los Angeles.	Ben Affleck has won the top film honour from the Directors Guild of America for his Iran hostage drama, Argo.
Andrew Travers left the authority by "mutual agreement" after the error, officials said. Voters were initially turned away from all 155 polling stations in the borough because their names were missing from the poll list. An independent investigation has been launched, the council said. In a statement issued through the council, Mr Travers said: "I have enjoyed my time at Barnet and I believe the changes we have put in place and the continued programme of growth and transformation will enable the borough to continue to thrive." A council spokesperson said Mr Travers had "made a valuable contribution to the council during his three and half years as chief executive." Deputy chief executive John Hooton will take over temporarily while longer term arrangements are put in place, the council said. On election day, staff at one station said just three of the first 30 voters to show up were on the register. The rest were told to come back later. Barnet Council apologised for the problems and later offered emergency proxy votes to residents who had been affected. But voters in the area questioned how the result could be "fair" when not everyone was able to have their say at the ballot box. A statement released by Mr Travers on Thursday blamed electoral registration lists for the problems. The council's review will conclude by the end of May and the findings will be presented publicly to the General Functions Committee. It will look at the "appropriateness" of arrangements in place for the EU Referendum in June. A spokesman said it was currently in discussions to establish who would lead the investigation.	The chief executive of Barnet Council has left his role after a blunder led to some voters being turned away from polling stations on Thursday.
They were last seen alive during a protest in the town of Iguala. Police fired on them and rounded them up, eventually handing them over to members of the Guerreros Unidos drug gang, who are widely thought to have killed them. But the students' families refuse to believe they are dead. They say they want more answers and will not give up looking for them. So how can Mexico move on? Last week Lourdes Caballero Sanchez took to the streets of the capital with thousands of other Mexicans to call for justice. It was a personal journey for her. Lourdes's 21-year-old brother Israel is one of the missing. Her belief that she will find him is unwavering. "I have an intuition that he's still alive. That's why we are here, asking [President] Pena Nieto to give us back our boys," she told me. "As a sister, I'm desperate. I miss him, I want to see him. I feel so powerless to not be able to do anything for him." But less than 24 hours later, Mexico's Attorney General Jesus Murillo Karam delivered a blow. He declared that the students were dead. His team, he said, had interviewed 99 people including members of the criminal gang that he alleges murdered the students. Based on 386 declarations from interviewees, 16 police raids and two reconstructions, the conclusion was that the students were killed by the gang and their bodies burned at a rubbish dump. The students' families angrily rejected this scenario. At a press conference held later in the day, one mother stood up and claimed that her son was not missing, he was being held by the government. Accusations that the government needs to be called to account have been flying at the same time that the authorities have been trying to draw this questioning to a close. The prosecutor reassured the families the case would not be shut yet, but even President Enrique Pena Nieto has said Mexico needs to move on. For many though, that is not an option. "I can understand the political logic of trying to put this behind the country, but I don't think there are the objective conditions for the country to turn the page," says independent security analyst Alejandro Hope. "The government has provided a narrative of what happened but hasn't yet provided an explanation. In the absence of a detailed version of why, this case will not be closed." The war on drugs has taken a brutal toll on Mexico in the past decade. More than 100,000 people have been killed and the latest official figures put the number of missing at 23,271. This week, some of the parents of the missing students travelled to Geneva to appeal for help from the United Nations Committee on Enforced Disappearances. Mexico's National Human Rights Commission also published a report ahead of the visit. Commission President Luis Raul Gonzalez Perez criticised the impunity in Mexican society, which he believes dates back to the 1970s and 1980s: decades when the government and left-wing student groups clashed with deadly results. He gave several recommendations to be discussed at the UN's sessions, one of which was a more systematic database of the missing to understand the true extent of the problem. One of the big concerns among human rights groups is that although many of the suspects arrested have been charged with kidnapping and murder, none have been charged with the crime of enforced disappearance. "It reflects that the Mexican government is reluctant to recognise that in Mexico enforced disappearances occur," says Denise Gonzalez, of the Miguel Agustin ProJuarez Human Rights Centre. "They are trying to water down their responsibilities. They are reluctant to recognise that state officials have engaged in enforced disappearances in Mexico." In a country used to the high number of dead in the drug war, this case of the Ayotzinapa students has stood out. The feeling, say experts, is that these young men should not be viewed as collateral in a narco-war. It has forced people to push for change. "The majority of Mexicans are now empowered and feel a personal responsibility to change things in the country," says John M Ackerman, a law professor at Mexico's National Autonomous University. "This is an invaluable achievement since it implies an historic break with the learned pessimism and passivity encouraged daily on the principal television and radio networks in Mexico." Their disappearance has forced the government to make changes, too. In November, President Pena Nieto announced plans to put all local police units under federal control and allow Congress to dissolve local governments infiltrated by drugs gangs. But with mid-term elections later this year, there are question marks as to whether these sweeping announcements will all get voted in. "It was a watershed moment for Mexican society, maybe," says Alejandro Hope. "But a watershed moment for government policy? I don't think so." Despite the feeling of stalemate among many, the investigation is not over yet. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) signed an agreement in November with the Mexican government and representatives of the disappeared students to look into the events of Ayotzinapa. They will be holding their first meeting later this month. There are still many questions surrounding the students' disappearance. The hope is that perhaps the IACHR will provide some answers to try and prevent another Ayotzinapa from ever happening again.	It has been more than four months since 43 students from a rural teaching school in Ayotzinapa, in Mexico's south-western state of Guerrero disappeared.
The Good Fight star said: "The reason I'm doing so well is our training, our work ethic... we learn our lines. "Why are we not trying to keep that here... and tell the whole world that we are the best rather than letting people slip through the net?" Jumbo was speaking to a Labour Party inquiry into access and diversity. She said she would love to find a job in Britain, but has had to take roles in the USA because there is more work on offer across the pond. "I would like nothing more than to be working on television and in film in this country," said the 31-year-old. Jumbo compared her experience with US drama The Good Fight and its predecessor The Good Wife with her role in ITV drama Vera. She said she stuck out "like a sore thumb" on the set of Vera and added:  "I was the only person of colour. "You take the cast picture at the end of the season and you look back at it and you're the one sticking out brown face in a group of people and it hurts." Jumbo said Britain was "pulling the plug" on its talent. She told Labour MPs Gloria de Piero and Tracy Brabin: "I didn't go to America, I didn't run to America, I didn't even ask for America, I just took a plane there and suddenly everyone was telling me you're so talented, would you like 52 jobs?" The London-born actress said: "I'm just going to go over to Amazon because they will (cast me in a lead role) and they pay for it. Then they offer you another one and another one and, because I write as well, there's opportunities to write there as well. "And it becomes less and less attractive to come back because you're coming back to nothing. She also said that students from diverse backgrounds were quitting drama school "because of how they are being treated". Samuel L Jackson criticised Hollywood for casting black British actors in films about US race relations earlier this year. British actor David Oyelowo said last year that he moved to the US because of the lack of opportunity for black actors in the UK.

The "black box" of the Su-24 jet was officially opened in Moscow on Friday in front of journalists and diplomats. Nikolai Primak, head of the Russian investigation, said flight information appeared to be missing. Data from the box could help resolve the dispute over the jet's location when it was hit. An analysis is expected to be released next week. The downing of the jet plunged relations between Russia and Turkey into crisis, with Moscow imposing sanctions in response. Turkey insists that the jet, from the Russian air contingent deployed in Syria in support of President Bashar al-Assad, ignored warnings to leave its airspace. Russia says it was shot down within Syrian airspace and President Vladimir Putin vented his anger at Turkey's government again on Thursday, accusing it of subservience to the US and of "creeping Islamisation". What we know about how the Su-24 was downed How Russia's sanctions could hit Turkey The war of words as it erupted The two countries are heavily involved in Syria but take radically different positions despite both being ostensibly opposed to the Islamic State (IS) militant group. The Su-24 was shot down by F-16 fighters on 24 November. Both crew members ejected but the pilot was killed, apparently by militants on the ground while the navigator was rescued. A Russian marine sent to rescue the crew was also killed and a helicopter destroyed on the ground. Russia has demanded an apology from Turkey and in the meantime has imposed sanctions including a ban on package holidays, which could cost Turkey billions of dollars.	The memory card in the flight recorder of a Russian fighter plane downed by Turkey on the Syrian border last month is damaged, Russian investigators say.
NHS England medical director Sir Bruce Keogh says he worries they will put vulnerable people "at risk", while chief medical officer Dame Sally Davies says they will "inevitably lead to patients suffering" and Health Minister Ben Gummer claims they will be put in "harm's way". It's easy to understand why. On 26 and 27 April junior doctors will stop providing emergency cover - unlike in the previous strikes in the contract dispute. It means as well as downing tools for their routine duties, medics will walk out of A&E units and intensive care departments, leaving some of the sickest and most vulnerable patients in the hands of others. But will the reality of the all-out strike be really as bad as the rhetoric? After all, the doctors' code of conduct produced by the General Medical Council decrees they must not harm patients or put them at risk. And the British Medical Association is adamant the stoppages do not breach this code because of the contingency plans being put in place. The union is legally bound to give the NHS seven days' notice of industrial action. In this case the health service has had five weeks. The time has allowed hospital bosses to carefully consider what they need and put plans in place. This has been done in partnership with BMA reps, while at a national level Department of Health and NHS England officials have been meeting regularly to ensure the contingency arrangements are satisfactory . And as yet no hospital has yet said it cannot cope. This is because large chunks of the routine work has been postponed and staff will be redeployed into emergency areas. There will be consultants, staff doctors - those who are not in training but have not yet reached consultant level - nurses, midwives and health care assistants in work. GPs are also being asked to keep a greater number of appointments free for urgent on-the-day cases than normal, while patients will be warned in the lead-up to the strike to think carefully about how they use the health service during the stoppages. The result is that there are plenty of people who think the system will run pretty smoothly. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and Royal College of Emergency Medicine have both released statements saying they are satisfied with the arrangements being put in place. In fact, you could argue the result in some departments may be that the system may actually work better than on a normal day. Take A&E, for example. Having more consultants on the floor could actually speed up the flow of patients as they will be able to make quick decisions about the care patients need. Although there is an argument the smaller hospitals with fewer consultants may find it more difficult. Meanwhile, in emergency surgery and intensive care the presence of consultants should, in theory, more than make up for the absence of the juniors. Also, it should be remembered that the stoppages are from 08:00 to 17:00 BST - not for 24 or 48 hours as the previous strikes have been - so there will be some respite during the two days. Instead, the problems might be more run of the mill. Junior doctors play a vital role chasing up test results, ordering x-rays, taking bloods, ordering prescriptions and preparing patients for discharge. Consultants may not have the time to do some of these, their skills may be a little rusty or they may simply not know their way round the system to get on top of the jobs. Senior nurses will be able to take some of the strain, but there is bound to be disruption. However, that doesn't mean the concerns being voiced are not justified. Talking to those who work in the service, there does seem to be a weak spot. It concerns what happens if there is an unexpected emergency on a general or surgical ward or perhaps in a psychiatric unit. When a patient collapses, a junior doctor would normally be one of the first on the scene. If they aren't there and a patient dies, questions will be naturally asked.  And this, perhaps, is the crux of the matter. It was a point made by Prof Lord Darzi of Denham, a surgeon and former health minister, in an article in the Daily Telegraph.. He wrote that every family afflicted with heartbreak on the strike days "would always wonder" whether loved ones would have lived if junior doctors had been there. Trust between doctors and society might be "irreparably damaged", he warned. This blog was first published on 15 April, but has since been updated to take into account subsequent developments.

Media playback is not supported on this device The Frenchman, 25, died on Friday as a result of head injuries suffered in a crash at the 2014 Japanese Grand Prix. Chilton, who raced with Bianchi at Marussia in 2013 and 2014, dominated the race at Iowa Speedway to earn his first win in any series since 2012. "I probably thought of Bianchi every five or 10 laps," said Chilton, 24. "He was a driver destined to probably be a world champion," he added. The Briton said he had learned of Bianchi's death on Friday night US time before going on to take a victory which saw him lead for 87 of the 100 laps at the 0.894-mile oval. Chilton's win came as a surprise as he was sitting 10th out of 15 drivers in Indy Lights going into the weekend. This was Chilton's ninth race in Indy Lights, his previous best finish being third. Bianchi had been in a coma since crashing his Marussia into a recovery vehicle at October's rain-hit race in Suzuka. "It's been a difficult nine months, to be brutally honest with you,'' Chilton said. "I've learned a lot from him and he was part of that win.' As well as racing as Marussia team-mates for two years, the pair also competed in karting from the age of 10 before rising through the racing ranks together. The Briton tweeted yesterday: "No words can describe what his family & the sport have lost. All I can say is it was a pleasure knowing and racing you."	Ex-Marussia driver Max Chilton dedicated his victory in the Indy Lights race on Saturday to his friend and former team-mate Jules Bianchi.
However, she said there were "many, many other questions" about Brexit and there was "still a lot to do". The UK proposal was unveiled by Prime Minister Theresa May at an EU summit in Brussels on Thursday. It would grant EU migrants who had lived in the UK for five years a new "UK settled status". That would allow them to stay in the country and access health, education and other benefits. The plan would affect 3.2 million EU citizens now living in the UK. Their rights - and the rights of UK citizens living in the rest of the EU - are among the thorny issues that have to be resolved early on in Brexit talks, along with the UK's divorce bill and the Northern Ireland border. "Theresa May made clear today that EU citizens who have been in Great Britain for five years can keep their full rights. That's a good start," said Mrs Merkel at the end of Thursday's talks. "But of course there are many, many other questions about Brexit - about finances, about the relationship with Ireland - which means we still have a lot to do until October." She insisted that Brexit was not the focus of the summit - the UK's split from the EU is being negotiated separately. "For me the shaping of the future of the 27 is a priority coming before the issue of the negotiations with Britain on the exit," she added. Before Mrs May's offer, the EU proposed that EU citizens in the UK and the estimated 1.2 million Britons living in EU countries should continue enjoying the same rights, enforceable by the European Court of Justice (ECJ). At the summit, the PM sought to reassure the 27 other EU states, saying the UK "does not want anyone here to have to leave, nor does it want families to be split up". "No-one will face a cliff edge," she said. The UK stunned the EU when it voted to end its membership in a referendum a year ago on Friday. The exit deadline is 30 March 2019. The summit's final day is to focus on migration, security and economic issues. Counter-terrorism has been a key issue at the summit which comes in the wake of an attack in Brussels on Tuesday. Several EU states have been attacked in recent weeks, including the UK, France and Sweden, and Mrs May said that an attack against any member state was an attack on all. Both sides would like to get the issue of citizens' rights wrapped up as soon as possible - it would be good for morale to get an early win, and they have more difficult issues to tackle. But while there is a sense that progress can be made, there are still some tricky technical questions to deal with. Which rights will be extended to immediate family members living elsewhere - to children in particular? And who will guarantee citizens' rights in the event of any legal dispute? The EU has already insisted that the European Court of Justice should be involved; the UK insists that British courts should uphold the deal. It is also not clear what the cut-off date should be for citizens to qualify for any offer that is agreed. The UK proposal suggests a date between March 2017 and March 2019 - although it is highly unlikely that the EU would be willing to accept a date that has already passed. From an EU perspective, what we've heard so far from the UK side remains rather vague. EU negotiators will want to see the details of this proposal which are only due to be made public next Monday.	German Chancellor Angela Merkel has described UK plans to ensure the rights of EU citizens in Britain after Brexit as "a good start".
The Office for National Statistics said industrial output fell 0.7% compared with January, when it dropped 0.3%. Unexpectedly warm weather drove the change, because it led to a fall in electricity and gas demand, the ONS said. Construction output fell by 1.7% in February, down from a revised January reading of zero growth. The construction figure, the biggest drop in nearly a year, was mainly the result of a 2.6% fall in the housebuilding sector. Meanwhile, the UK's deficit in goods and services widened to Â£3.7bn in February, from a revised figure of Â£3bn in January. According to the ONS, the deficit was fuelled by what it called "erratic items", such as imports of gold and aircraft. "The overall trade deficit worsened, but excluding erratic items, the picture improved, as imports fell more than exports," said ONS senior statistician Kate Davies. Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Markit, called the figures "a disappointing package of data for the UK economy which fuels suspicion that GDP growth slowed markedly, largely due to consumers becoming more cautious". He added: "We suspect UK GDP growth in the first quarter of 2017 slowed to 0.4% quarter-on-quarter from 0.7% quarter-on-quarter in the fourth quarter of 2016 - this would be the weakest growth rate since the first quarter of 2016."	Activity in the UK's industrial and construction sectors shrank in February, new figures show.
The 42-year-old had regained the lead from Frenchman Armel Le Cléac'h, but was second as he passed the halfway mark just off New Zealand's south island. Thomson's next milestone is to turn north at Cape Horn as he heads towards the finish port of Les Sables d'Olonne. Gosport-based Thomson  is aiming to be the first Briton to win the race. Media playback is not supported on this device "There are a few hectic days to come and I will certainly be approaching them with caution to make sure that I keep Hugo Boss (Thomson's boat) in one piece," he said. "It's over 1000 miles behind me to third place, so at least I have some breathing space behind so I can worry about looking forwards, which I think is really important".	Welsh sailor Alex Thomson has passed the halfway point of the solo non-stop round-the-world race, the Vendee Globe.

Eleven care workers are to be sentenced later for the maltreatment and neglect of five patients at Winterbourne View. But a BBC Inside Out West investigation has found evidence of alleged abuse involving different staff members. Police have agreed the assault on Ben Pullar was "not acceptable" but said they would not re-open the case. Mr Pullar is autistic and bi-polar, with severe learning difficulties, and when he was 18, he spent almost a year at Winterbourne View from July 2009. He lost two teeth when he was punched in the face. His twin, Tom, said his behaviour changed drastically after going to the hospital. "He's burst out crying on me and demanded to talk about Winterbourne View - and this is two years after Winterbourne View - so it still affects him today," said the 21-year-old. The BBC has seen daily care notes from his time at the hospital which state Mr Pullar "had an accident with his teeth" just weeks after he arrived. His family said they were given mixed messages about what happened and were told at one point he had "bitten the floor". He was taken to Bristol Dental Hospital by Winterbourne View staff as an emergency patient, and two doctors there raised the alarm with the authorities because of the severity of his injuries. Senior dental consultant Dr Jane Luker said: "I think they thought the injury he sustained wasn't consistent with what they were being told. "He had allegedly bitten a carer and the injuries were sustained from him biting that carer. "[But] because the teeth were pushed back palatally, towards the back of the mouth, it would be consistent with a punch or a blow to the front of the face." The authorities met several days after Mr Pullar was assaulted, but his family was not invited. Tom Pullar said: "I think that care staff are supposed to care for patients, not punch them." Notes obtained by Inside Out said the nurse was bitten and retaliated in order to remove his fingers - and later, that he had pushed and pulled to get them out. The nurse involved, Maxwell Nyamukapa, was suspended and later reinstated. Despite repeated attempts to contact Mr Nyamukapa, he has refused to comment. The police logged it as an assault, and said the nurse had acted instinctively and in self-defence. Forty concerns were raised about patients in just over three years with the local safeguarding board run by South Gloucestershire Council. The police were also contacted 29 times, nine of those times related to carers suspected of using restraint of involved in violent incidents with patients - including Mr Pullar. Det Ch Supt Louisa Rolfe, of Avon and Somerset Police, said: "We have carried out an extensive investigation into incidents at Winterbourne View and no stone has been left unturned. "We consulted with the CPS and our partners in terms of action we could take. "Looking back on that incident now and understanding the whole pattern of what was happening at that residential hospital, it is clearly not acceptable. "However, at the time, the officer was dealing with information, reliable information, that came from patients and carers, and that came from other experts in that field. And perhaps they relied upon that information too much." She added: "We accept that there is learning for us as an organisation and we will do things differently in future." Det Ch Supt Rolfe said the force had carried out an extensive investigation into incidents at the hospital and had improved how it dealt with people with learning disabilities. The council has declined to comment on Mr Pullar's case. Castlebeck, the hospital's owner at the time, said its new board and management had already, and would continue to, rigorously review what happened at Winterbourne View. The firm said if any other matters come to light, immediate action would be taken and the appropriate authorities informed. It has also referred Mr Nyamukapa twice to the Nursing & Midwifery Council, who declined to comment. Inside Out West is on BBC One West at 7.30pm on Monday or for seven days after on the iPlayer.	The family of a man who was punched in the face as a patient at a private hospital in Bristol is calling for the incident to be re-investigated.
Pakistan's military spokesman says the line has just been used for the first time as the two countries work to improve co-ordination along the border. The move was agreed when Pakistani army chief Raheel Sharif visited Kabul. Security co-operation between the two countries is seen as crucial in countering the growing Taliban threat. Earlier this month Afghan President Ashraf Ghani blamed Pakistan-based militant groups for the escalating violence. Afghan officials often accuse Pakistan of controlling the Afghan Taliban. The say that Islamabad allows the most senior Afghan Taliban leaders to operate freely there. Pakistan denies this although it admits having contacts with the militants. News of the hotline comes as Afghanistan will host discussions next week with Pakistan, the US and China to prepare the ground for possible Afghan peace talks involving the Taliban. Afghanistan sees Pakistani support as crucial if negotiations with the Taliban are to be successful. President Ghani has recently moved towards strengthening ties with Pakistan - the Taliban's historic supporters - in what correspondents say is a desperate bid to restart peace negotiations as the insurgency spreads. The president warned that the presence of international militant groups - including al-Qaeda, Islamic State and militant groups from China, Russia, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and the Middle East - was growing in Afghanistan. Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said at the beginning of this month that "working for the achievement of a peaceful neighbourhood is a cardinal principal of Pakistan's foreign policy". "We should envisage collective and co-ordinated measures on the regional security front to ensure that the gains and struggle against terrorism are durable and irreversible," he said.	Pakistan and Afghanistan have established a hotline between their respective military commanders to reduce frequent cross-border tensions.
The RAC said the higher prices were due to a combination of rising crude oil prices, and the devaluation of the pound after June's Brexit vote. Average petrol prices rose by 4.4p to 116.7p per litre and average diesel prices rose 5.2p to 118.7p per litre. The motoring body said these were the biggest monthly increases for three and a half years. Its fuel spokesman, Simon Williams, said retailers had "no choice" but to put up prices on garage forecourts. "The effects of the weak pound have really been felt on the wholesale market, and this, combined with an oil price at nearly double its lowest level in 2016, has put significant upward pressure on wholesale fuel prices," he said. "Certainly, we are a long way from the remarkably low fuel prices enjoyed by families and businesses early in 2016, when the average price of unleaded was around 102p per litre and diesel was 101p," he added. According to the RAC, the increases mean it now costs Â£64.20 to fill the 55-litre petrol tank of a typical family car. Meanwhile it costs Â£65.25 to fill up a similarly sized tank in a diesel car. The RAC suggested that the price of fuel might stabilise in the coming months. "Opec, which represents some of the world's biggest oil producers, recently agreed in principle a cut in production," said Mr Williams. "But a final deal is still to be agreed at an Opec meeting at the end of this month and, with some analysts suggesting a deal might yet stall, this leaves open the prospect oil prices might stabilise or even fall before the end of the year," he added.	Petrol and diesel prices rose sharply in October, said the RAC, taking them to their highest level since July 2015.
The wicketkeeper-batter, 26, has been a key part of the England set-up since making her international debut in 2006. She is England's third highest one-day international run-scorer and second only to Charlotte Edwards in T20 games. In October last year, Sussex's Taylor, who took a four-month sabbatical in 2010, became the first woman to play in Australian first-grade cricket. The England and Wales Cricket Board said Taylor could still feature in the one-day and Twenty20 series against Pakistan beginning on 20 June. An ECB spokesperson said they were continuing to monitor the situation and that the board would "support her, keep in touch and talk with her prior to selection for the Pakistan series and the start of the Super League". Taylor has scored 5,581 international runs in 190 appearances, claiming 114 catches and 88 stumpings, and is one of only seven women to play in 100 ODIs for England. Last November, her Sussex team-mate Holly Colvin retired from international cricket to take up a role with the ICC in Dubai. And last week, England captain and record run-scorer Charlotte Edwards announced her international retirement after being told coach Mark Robinson wanted to build a new team.	England's Sarah Taylor is taking an indefinite break from cricket for personal reasons.
The Yongbyon site processes spent fuel from power stations and has been the source of plutonium for North Korea's nuclear weapons programme. The reactor was shut down in 2007 but Pyongyang said last year that it was operational again. It has since conducted its fourth test of a nuclear weapon. That and its multiple missile tests broke existing international sanctions and provoked further measures from the UN and individual countries. The IAEA has no access to North Korea after being thrown out in 2009,  so relies largely on satellite data. But the agency's head, Yukiya Amano, said recent images indicated "activities related to the five-megawatt reactor, expansion of enrichment facilities and activities related to reprocessing". Vehicles have also been seen moving at the site and there are indications of warm water being discharged, which would suggest cooling operations. Other North Korean observers have also said in recent months that the plant appears to be working again. At North Korea's recent ruling party congress, leader Kim Jong-un reinforced his policy of economic development coupled with a strong nuclear programme.	North Korea appears to have restarted its nuclear facility at Yongbyon, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has said.
The Premier League got under way this weekend, with many teams showing off their new signings, but who impressed and who had a debut to forget? From scoring a wonder goal to being booked after barely a minute on the pitch, BBC Sport takes a look at how some of those making their top-flight bow got on. Dimitri Payet, signed by West Ham from Marseille in the summer, created more chances than any other player in Europe's top five leagues last season and he certainly added a creative edge to the Hammers' attack in Sunday's shock 2-0 win at Arsenal. The 28-year-old took the free-kick that caught out Petr Cech and allowed Cheikhou Kouyate to head home the opener, and was a lively presence throughout. Newcastle's signing of Dutch midfielder Georginio Wijnaldum from PSV was certainly one of the more impressive captures of the summer, and the 24-year-old made a strong impression on his Premier League debut. Wijnaldum headed Newcastle ahead against Southampton on Sunday, but the hosts could not hold on as the Saints fought back to earn a 2-2 draw. There were plenty of reasons to be impressed with Swansea's performance as they held defending champions Chelsea to a 2-2 draw, and Andre Ayew was one of them. The Ghana forward showed cat-like instincts to pull a rebound from a Thibaut Courtois save to catch out John Terry, before calmly steering the ball home for one the opening weekend's best goals. The same could not be said for Andre's younger brother, however. Jordan Ayew started for Aston Villa at Premier League new boys Bournemouth, but the former Lorient striker failed to make an impression and was substituted on the hour. His replacement, Rudy Gestede, instead caught the eye as he grabbed the Villa winner. With fellow debutant Wijnaldum impressing, Aleksander Mitrovic was evidently keen to make an impression when he climbed off the bench in the 75th minute. Sadly, it was not the kind of impression he would have liked as, less than a minute after coming on, he was booked for a foul on Matt Targett. Youthful naivety from the 20-year-old. Exciting, fast and skilful. Memphis Depay certainly looked like a signing that will get Manchester United fans on their feet, but what his Premier League debut performance lacked was a goal threat. The 21-year-old Netherlands winger had a couple of half chances, but never really looked like troubling Michel Vorm in the Tottenham goal during Saturday's 1-0 win for Louis van Gaal's side.	New season, new faces.
Mark Drakeford will be presenting the Welsh Government's spending plans to AMs for the first time since he was installed as finance secretary. The last financial plan - for 2016/17 - saw cuts for local government but rises in funding for the NHS and education. This year's plan, as in previous years, is likely to be a story of how the government manages declining pots of Westminster cash and what priorities it has. Last year's budget came to almost exactly £15bn, but for 2017/18 we are expecting that to shrink to something between £14.6bn and £14.8bn. That would amount to £200m-£400m less cash to spend. There are inevitably going to be cuts in some parts of the Welsh Government's budget. Wales cannot raise its own money through taxes yet and so does not have scope to raise extra money itself.  Apart from the proceeds of business rates, it gets all of its money from the UK government. Some small taxes - stamp duty and landfill tax - will be devolved by 2018, so this is the last budget where they will not be factored in. At the assembly election Labour - which came out as the largest party and leads the government which includes one Liberal Democrat minister - made a list of pledges which it will need to fund if it is going to keep them. The fact that the Welsh Government is operating a "one-in, one-out" approach to spending means every new thing being funded needs something else scrapped to pay for it. A few weeks ago First Minister Carwyn Jones said Labour would keep those promises - but warned there were going to be cuts. The government's five-year programme includes: Ministers always face pressure to boost funding for the NHS - and there could well be a boost for health in the budget. Last week experts warned that NHS Wales faces a £700m black hole in its finances in just three years time. Wales cut NHS funding in 2010 and for three years after that - leading to a torrent of criticism - but in recent years budgets have been rising. Currently health and social care account for 48% of the overall Welsh Government budget. Could this be the year that the budget for health services reaches 50% - or more? Meanwhile local government is lobbying for no further cuts to councils. Last year the Welsh Government cut the overall council budget by 2%, although it had felt it was quite generous compared to what happened in England. Given the possibility of difficult battles for Labour around the corner in next May's council elections, ministers might want to give county halls some respite this time. We know that Communities First is set for the axe - worth £30m a year. The scheme has been the Welsh Government's flagship anti-poverty project for 15 years but Communities Secretary Carl Sargeant said he was not convinced it was effective. There are plenty of departments that could see their budgets trimmed - further education and economic development, maybe natural resources. Education Secretary Kirsty Williams has also expressed scepticism about the effectiveness of Schools Challenge Cymru - a fund aimed at underperforming schools. Could the £20m scheme be coming to an end? Labour did not win a majority at the last assembly election and must govern by doing deals with others. Lib Dem Kirsty Williams is already on board with a cabinet post and Labour has an arrangement with Plaid Cymru where the two parties talk about policies in joint committees - a forum where the budget will have been discussed. Plaid leader Leanne Wood confirmed to BBC Wales on Monday that a deal had been done with Labour to back the budget. It could be the case that Labour will need to fund one or more of Plaid's manifesto commitments as the price for its support. The "compact" agreement which saw Plaid back Carwyn Jones's return as first minister listed a set of priorities where the two parties had something of a consensus. They included childcare and the delivery of new all-age apprenticeships, and increases to the number of healthcare workers and GPs.	AMs gather in the Senedd on Tuesday for arguably the most important announcement in the assembly calendar - the budget.
The animals are easier to spot in spring when vegetation is low and the breeding season is under way. Hares may be declining in parts of the UK, while rabbits have been hit by myxomatosis and other viral diseases, says the Mammal Society. People are being asked to send in photographs of rabbits and hares to help map the UK population. Dr Fiona Mathews, senior lecturer in mammalian biology and chair of the Mammal Society, said: "We have very poor information on rabbits and hares - and it's important to know if numbers are going up or down. "They are part of the ecosystem and lots of other animals depend on them, either through grazing of their habitat or as a food source for foxes or birds of prey." She said some parts of the UK had very low populations of rabbits and hares, particularly where there had been disease outbreaks. However, in other regions they have become so abundant they have become agricultural pests. The Mammal society wants people across the country to send in sightings of wild rabbits or hares across the countryside, including parks, fields and mountains. The data will be used in a national atlas of mammals to support future conservation and research projects. Derek Crawley, who is co-ordinating the atlas, said rabbits and hares can be distinguished by their gait and appearance. "Hares are larger, have long limbs and lollop along whereas the rabbit has a bobbing gait," he said. "The ears are also distinctive: those of hares are longer and have black tips." Sightings of rabbits and hares, or their signs in the countryside, such as droppings and burrows, with any photographs taken, can be reported via the Mammal Tracker app, The Mammal Society website, or by posting information to The Mammal Society.	Biologists are calling on the public to report sightings of rabbits and hares as part of a conservation effort.
Three of those executed had been convicted of an attack in Tiananmen Square in Beijing last October, in which five people died, Xinhua said. The others were found guilty of crimes including bomb-making and arson. The government has accused separatist militants based in Xinjiang of carrying out a string of recent attacks. Xinjiang is the traditional home of Muslim Uighurs, who speak a distinct language and have different customs to the majority Han population elsewhere in China. Huseyin Guxur, Yusup Wherniyas and Yusup Ehmet were "deprived of political rights for life" because of their role in the deadly car crash on Tiananmen Square in October 2013, Xinhua said. "They masterminded the terrorist attack," the news agency added. In the incident, a car rammed into bystanders on the politically important Beijing square before bursting into flames. Two tourists died, along with three of the attackers. Xinhua named some of the other men who were executed along with the Tiananmen attack perpetrators: Dilxat Raxit, a spokesman for the World Uighur Congress exile group, called the executions "a typical case of the law serving political ends". Chinese officials often attribute attacks in Xinjiang to Uighur separatists, accusing them of seeking to establish an independent state called East Turkestan. Beijing has recently blamed them for an attack in May at a market in Urumqi, that left at least 31 people dead. It also accused them of being behind a mass knife attack in the southern province of Yunnan in March, in which 29 were killed and more than 130 injured. Uighur leaders deny they are co-ordinating a terrorist campaign. They say the government's repressive policies in Xinjiang have provoked the unrest. Who are the Uighurs?	China has executed eight people in the north-western region of Xinjiang, for what it calls "terrorist" attacks, reports the state news agency Xinhua.
Emergency numbers were down and the coastguard lost all radio and telephone links between the mainland for almost five hours. NHS Shetland had earlier advised anyone needing medical attention to make their way to the hospital in Lerwick. Flights were delayed and cancelled at Sumburgh Airport. Services were restored shortly before 17:00. BT said the problems were caused by "blown rectifiers and fuses" at the Wideford Hill radio transmitter on Orkney. A spokesman said 2,600 telephone customers and 388 broadband customers had been affected. A total of eleven flights were cancelled at Sumburgh and one was diverted to Kirkwall. Highlands and Islands Airports Limited advised passengers to contact their airlines for further information. Shetland MSP Tavish Scott has called for an "urgent investigation" into why radio communications and telephone links failed.	Mobile and landline telephone services have been restored in Shetland after coverage was lost for several hours causing disruption.
His government has lasted just more than a year, with limited support from the main opposition party, Fianna Fáil. Brexit and Northern Ireland's political stalemate are among the challenges waiting for the new taoiseach. The leadership contest will begin on Thursday, with the new leader to be announced on 2 June after an electoral college of the parliamentary party. County councillors and party members will also have their say. While the field may widen before 2 June, the early favourites for the post are Social Protection Minister Leo Varadkar and Housing Minister Simon Coveney. Born in Dublin, the 38-year-old is the son of a Mumbai-born doctor and a mother from County Waterford. He was privately educated and studied medicine at Trinity College in Dublin, qualifying as a GP before entering politics. He was elected to parliament in 2007 as a representative for Dublin West and held the tourism and health portfolios before taking on his current post last year. In an RTÉ interview in 2015, he revealed that he is gay, explaining that he wanted to be clear on the matter ahead of the Irish referendum on same-sex marriage. "I just kind of want to be honest with people," he said. "I don't want anyone to think that I have a hidden agenda." Mr Varadkar has courted controversy by announcing that people convicted of welfare fraud will be "named and shamed" on a government website. In a recent speech reported by the Irish Independent, he outlined his attitude to Brexit, saying there should be "no economic border at all between north and south". The son of the former Fine Gael politician Hugh Coveney, the Cork-born 44-year-old has followed his father's footsteps to a seat in the Dáil (Irish parliament). As a teenager, he was expelled from the exclusive Clongowes Wood boarding school for drinking and bunking off to attend a beach party. In a candid interview with RTÉ, he said he had suffered from a stutter, and lived in the shadow of his more promising brother, who is now a successful businessman. He went on to study management at the Royal Agricultural College in Gloucestershire, England, before his election as the youngest member of the Dáil in 1998. He was appointed as agriculture minister in 2011 and responsibility for defence was added to his portfolio three years later. He has made no secret of his desire to lead his party - when RTÉ asked the question about his intentions, he said: "I am very ambitious, so the straight answer is yes, some day. "But I am personally very loyal to Enda and he knows that."	As Irish PM Enda Kenny quits as Fine Gael leader, eyes are focusing on who might succeed him.
Routine monitoring by Argyll and Bute Council discovered raised levels of algal toxins in Loch Melfort and Seil Sound. The naturally-occurring toxins were above the "legally-permitted levels for harvest". Members of the public have been asked not to gather them. The toxins accumulate in molluscs such as mussels, oysters, cockles and razor clams, and when levels breach statutory limits, harvesting of affected species is prohibited. Elsewhere, raised levels of Escheria coli (E.coli) bacteria have been identified in Oitir Mhor Bay. It follows the discovery of raised levels at Kerrera West, Loch Craignish, Kilfinichen Bay and Castle Stalker. They were discovered by the council's environmental health team as part of their work to maintain the quality of shellfish. Potential raised levels of E.coli were also found at Dunstaffnage, Kerrera East, Loch na Cille and Loch Riddon. A council spokesman said: "Eating shellfish such as cockles, mussels, oysters and razor fish from affected areas can pose a risk to human health. "Notices to warn the public and casual gatherers have been posted along the shore. Commercial shellfish harvesters in these areas have been contacted by the council and steps taken to postpone harvesting until bacterial levels subside. "People are advised to avoid eating shellfish from these areas until further notice as a precaution. When levels subside, the warning notices will be removed."	People have been warned not to eat shellfish in parts of Argyll and Bute after raised levels of toxins were found.
De Roon moved to Teesside in June 2016 for an initial £8.8m fee and played 33 Premier League games last term. The Netherlands international, 26, scored five goals in 36 league and cup games during his spell at Boro. Meanwhile, manager Garry Monk confirmed the Championship club's interest in signing Chelsea midfielder Lewis Baker. "He's a target and one of many that we've had throughout the summer months," said Monk. Find all the latest football transfers on our dedicated page.	Italian Serie A side Atalanta have re-signed midfielder Marten De Roon from Middlesbrough for an undisclosed fee, 14 months after selling him to Boro.
A Monitor report published in February called for the closure of acute services including the A&E department. The trust that runs the hospital was put into administration by the health regulator Monitor on Monday. Support Stafford Hospital campaigners and police said up to 30,000 people had joined the mile-long march, from the town centre to the hospital. The campaign group said the town's Market Square was so full of protesters it took 45 minutes for it to clear after the march started at about 1400 BST. Thousands of people had previously signed a petition calling for Stafford Hospital's services to remain and a campaign shop from the protest group has been set up in the town centre. By Chris KingBBC Radio Stoke For the past four years the name "Stafford Hospital" has been a byword for everything that is bad about the NHS. Today, 30,000 people turned out with their banners and placards to send out the message that they believe their hospital is now safe, and they are prepared to fight for its future. The special administrators were not there today but they will find it hard to ignore the views of so many people. Last week they told me that they were starting with a blank sheet of paper when it came to the future of services at the Mid Staffordshire Trust. This afternoon the people of Stafford gave them a clear indication of what they'd like them to write on it. Jean Tabarner, one of the marchers, said she had had cancer and that Stafford Hospital had saved her life. She said: "We've got to try - if you don't try, no-one will listen. We've got to keep plugging away and hope that the administrators listen to what the people around here want." Sue Hawkins, chair of the Support Stafford Hospital group, said she believed it was important for people to move on from what had happened in the past at the hospital. She said: "We've got a safe hospital today and we're looking to the future." She added: "We need to have an intensive care unit here, we need to have an accident and emergency 24 hours a day and we believe that's possible. "We know there have to be changes, we know there may have to be some alliance with another hospital to achieve that." Stafford Borough Council leader Mike Heenan, who joined the marchers, said: "The important thing is delivering services locally, for the local people. "That's what we're fighting for - so that acute services can stay in Stafford." Monitor has given the administrators for the Mid Staffordshire NHS Trust, Ernst and Young, 145 days to work with local healthcare organisations to produce a "sustainable plan" for the future of services at the Stafford and Cannock Chase hospitals. The Contingency Planning Team (CPT) report to Monitor last month said staffing levels at the hospitals were not sufficient to meet required standards in the long term, given the current range of services and number of patients. It said some services, including accident and emergency, intensive care and maternity, could be provided at the University Hospital of North Staffordshire, the Royal Wolverhampton Hospital Trust and Walsall Healthcare NHS Trust instead. Unison officials said earlier this week the administrators had told the union that they "were not bound by the recommendations". The town of Stafford has a population of about 63,000 people, while its surrounding borough is made up of 122,000 people. The area covered by the health trust extends beyond that, also taking in homes covered by the Cannock Chase Council area. Staffordshire Police said there was no trouble during the march.	Thousands of people have marched in opposition to plans to downgrade Stafford Hospital's services.
Mr Hockey's appointment comes after he left politics following his removal as treasurer by Malcolm Turnbull. He had been seen as a close ally of Tony Abbott who was ousted as PM by Mr Turnbull in a party vote in September. Mr Turnbull said Mr Hockey was "a great Australian, he is one of the most engaging, persuasive people I've known in public life". "He's held very high office, he's got great contacts in the United States, he's a passionate patriot," he told Australian media. Announcing the appointment, Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said Australia's relationship with the United States was the "bedrock of foreign and defence policy". Some in the Labor opposition questioned the move, citing Mr Turnbull's role in ousting Mr Abbott and Mr Hockey's departure from politics. "This is a very important posting for Australia and should be done by someone with a deep interest for foreign affairs," said deputy opposition leader Tanya Plibersek. "There is no doubt this is a captain's pick by Malcolm Turnbull," she told ABC television. Kim Beazley, who has has been Australia's ambassador to the United States since 2010, will be replaced by Mr Hockey in January.	Australia's former treasurer Joe Hockey has been named as the new ambassador to the United States.
Media playback is not supported on this device The Tigers are 19th in the table after Monday's 1-0 defeat at Middlesbrough. They had only 13 senior players available on the opening day of the season, and signed six in the last two days of the summer transfer window. "Our signings have done their bit but they were last minute," said Davies. "I don't believe the manager had time to explore all of his options." Mike Phelan succeeded Steve Bruce as Hull boss in July but was only given the job on a permanent basis in October. The Tigers have scored only 11 league goals this season, fewer than any other team in the top flight. "We need someone who can put the ball in the net," added Davies. In a dour affair at the Riverside that was settled by a Gaston Ramirez header, Phelan's side did not seriously threaten the home goal until injury time. "Our first shot on target was in the 92nd minute and that is not good enough," said Davies, who described his side as "gutless" and "embarrassing" after a 6-1 defeat at Bournemouth in October. Hull, who have lost eight of their past 10 league games, were without six injured players and the suspended Dieumerci Mbokani for the trip to Boro. "Hopefully come January we will look different," said Phelan. "We need that investment. We can't afford any more injuries, it is going to be a hard slog throughout Christmas."	Hull City need help as they fight to avoid relegation from the Premier League, says defender Curtis Davies.
If the 70th UN General Assembly had a face, it would not only be showing its age, but it would be covered in the cuts and bruises from unending wars, new coups and the perennial problems of poverty, hunger and the new open, weeping sores that are the movements of the desperate and despairing across oceans and borders. For African leaders, the UN in New York is the place to be seen and heard every September. They are there under the magical veil of diplomatic immunity, not only because their leadership is recognised but also because it allows those who are older than the General Assembly to attend, as well as those who have been ostracised by international opinion, those who have been targeted by the International Criminal Court, and those who wish to plead for special attention or show that they are tackling corruption. Small budgets are prepared from the national coffers for the delegates accompanying the heads of state and first ladies fond of shopping, who mark the General Assembly dates in their diaries long in advance. This year's gathering has even featured a rock star Pope, and the Catholics among Africa's leadership may have wanted to touch that holy hand, though they may not have been so keen on confession. Still, it does not help to be too cynical, for Africa needs the UN more than any other continent. A brief scan of the UN's history will show us that while its predecessor, the League of Nations, threw South West Africa - present-day Namibia - from the frying pan of German occupation into the fire of apartheid jurisdiction, the UN has been largely present in tumultuous events in Africa these past 70 years. A UN Secretary General - Swedish statesman Dag Hammarskjold - lost his life in a plane crash in the Zambian town of Ndola in 1961 on his way to peace talks in the Congolese breakaway province of Katanga. Since then UN peacekeeping forces in Africa have been a regular and needed part of the continent's story:  19,000 troops are currently serving in the Democratic Republic of Congo; 12,000 are trying to restore order to the Central African Republic, another 10,000 are deployed in Mali and the UN mission in Liberia is due to end in June 2016 - having been there since 2003. Current UN peace missions in Africa The relationship between peacekeepers and Africa has been fraught with accusations of mineral theft and more seriously the sexual abuse of women and children by the international UN forces, but the security situation without them does not bear contemplation. In 2015 a look at the headlines shows us that from Libya downwards, violence prevails. It reveals that the fight for self-determination in South Sudan has resulted in increasing deaths after independence; Burkina Faso's presidential guard has become addicted to power and that economies wrecked by Ebola cannot do without international assistance. World leaders have now agreed on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which replace the Millennium Goals, and feature many of the issues that the 20th Century grappled with. Farai Sevenzo: "From rising prices, to lack of pasture for cattle to drought and floods - food and hunger remain the continent's major worry" But paramount amongst the 17 SDGs is the struggle to end hunger. "While the number of people suffering from hunger in developing regions has fallen by half since 1990, there are still close to 800 million people undernourished worldwide, a majority children and youth," said Mogens Lykketoft, president of the 70th session of the UN General Assembly. Of course hunger has not arrived unannounced, the state of the planet and the effects of global warming have been playing havoc with people's crops all over southern Africa. Malawi, the UN World Food Programme (WFP) has warned, faces its worst food crisis in 10 years. The WFP says 2.8 million people are at risk and that an astonishing four out of every 10 Malawian children are suffering from stunted growth. Poor rainfall affected the crops in 2013/2014 and then floods compounded the problem in early 2015 by destroying homes and wiping out food supplies. USAid's Famine Early Warning System has also listed food shortages in Ethiopia and Somalia, as well as in Sierra Leone and Liberia following the outbreak of Ebola. From rising prices, to lack of pasture for cattle to drought and floods - food and hunger remain the continent's major worry. Those attending the Sustainable Goals event spoke of its wide scope; UN chief Ban Ki-Moon said the new development blueprint was designed to "resonate with people across the world", while  UN Development Programme head Helen Clark said the goals called "for a paradigm shift in how the international society understands development". Development, if truth be told, has sometimes been hampered by some of the very people who gather every September in the autumn sunshine. But it is their solemn duty - and ours - to try and develop ourselves. At its worst, the UN is a grey monolithic beast that is overstaffed with career diplomats and "angels of mercy" who run around African cities in their 4x4s on behalf of Western charities and their own ambitious career paths. But at its best, the UN is the last refuge for the powerless, the hungry and the needy. And Africa has far too many people in all three categories to do without it.	In our series of letters from African journalists, film-maker and columnist Farai Sevenzo considers why the UN matters to Africa.
The raids by 19 RAF Lancaster bombers destroyed two strategically significant German dams and damaged a third. Taken by the Nazi authorities before and after the raids - on 16 and 17 May 1943 - the aerial images are stamped "Secret Command Document". The photographs were sold in Nottingham for Â£2,100 - considerably more than the list price of Â£1,200. As well as the time and date of the images, they also carry a warning forbidding them to be copied. The revolutionary bombs skipped across the lakes behind the dams and showed how precision attacks were possible in an age when most missions were lucky to get within miles of their target. Eight aircraft were lost and 56 of 133 aircrew were killed or captured.  An estimated 1,600 people died on the ground. International Autograph Auctions, of Nottingham, offered a set of reconnaissance images showing the Mohne and Edersee dams. Two pairs show the Mohne and Edersee dams before and after the attacks and a fifth image of a reserve dam on the Mohne reservoir shows how part of it had emptied out. Carl Buck, senior researcher at International Autograph Auctions, said: "The usual pictures we see of the dam raids are from photo-reconnaissance Spitfires despatched after the mission or close ups from Germany." Dambusters expert Charles Foster said: "The fascination with the Dambusters themselves is because it combined so many different things which contributed to the war effort - a revolutionary new weapon, supreme airmanship skills and raw courage in pressing home an attack under fire. "The fact that it was then immortalised in what is now regarded as one of the best ever British war films just adds to its mystique."	A set of rare photographs showing the impact of the Dambusters' "bouncing bomb" raids have been sold at auction.
Former Chester and Kidderminster boss Burr, 57, joined the Sandgrounders in September to replace Andy Bishop when they were second bottom. But they have lost their last three games and are only a point above the National League drop zone. Watson, 46, has spent eight years as manager at Southport in two spells. "Following a disappointing series of results the board have taken the above decision in the best interests of Southport to move forward in a different direction," said a club statement. "With 19 players recruited during Steve Burr's tenure and significant financial backing to strengthen the squad, the performances and results recently have not shown signs that confirm the club can get to a position in the league that provides the security as required."	Southport have sacked manager Steve Burr after just over four months in charge, with director of football Liam Watson taking interim charge.
Argentine journalists have become accustomed, after eight years under Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner's presidency, to getting little or no access to the person at the top. For all her appearances at inaugurations of public works or rousing speeches before the Peronist party faithful, President Fernandez de Kirchner rarely exposes herself to scrutiny and even less so to the kind of open press forum that enables journalists to question and probe the work of her government. Not that Mr Macri was particularly illuminating or generous with detail, particularly when asked about the specifics of his plans to turn around Argentina's precarious economy. But at least he made the effort to engage and respond to questions. So what have we learned in the first few days about the man who defeated a political movement that has dominated Argentine politics for decades? The outgoing mayor of Buenos Aires and soon to be president of Argentina repeated on more than one occasion that he could not yet expand on the detail of his economic plans until he was able to ascertain exactly how critical the situation was. The current administration has been repeatedly accused of being less than transparent about key statistics like the real rate of inflation or exactly how much liquid reserves remain in the Central Bank coffers. Correcting those anomalies and introducing measures to restore international confidence in the Argentine economy are likely to be some of Mauricio Macri's first big policy initiatives when he assumes the presidency on 10 December. To that end we learned that, rather than appointing a single minister for the economy, there will be a team of no less than six ministers responsible for the economy brief. This historic election reflected the deep divisions in Argentine society, with barely three percentage points ultimately separating Mauricio Macri and the defeated Peronist candidate, Daniel Scioli. While the victor's well-heeled and middle-class will be expecting a more liberal economic climate, those less well-off working class Argentines who voted for Mr Scioli will also be hoping the new administration protects the welfare programmes introduced by the Fernandez de Kirchner government. Mr Macri indeed promised to be a "president for all Argentines", knowing the powerful labour unions and sometimes volatile Peronist youth movements will become restless if economic "reform" turns out to mean across-the-board "cuts". There is clearly not much love lost between the man heading into the hot seat and the woman who has governed Argentina in her own unique style for the past eight years, her reputation and legacy damaged by an election result few would have predicted only a couple of months ago. Without saying so directly, Mr Macri made it abundantly clear that Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner's combative and sometimes bellicose style had damaged Argentina's image abroad. Rebuilding relations with neighbours in Latin America and allies further afield, would be another job at the top of his "to do" list. The most interesting of those relationships is with Venezuela. Its leftist, revolutionary president, Nicolas Maduro has been one of Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner's closest allies in the region - part of a populist alliance that included Bolivia and Ecuador, (but less so Chile and Brazil with whom the outgoing president has not always been on the closest terms) Mr Macri is preparing to realign those alliances, hinting that he might seek to suspend Venezuela from the regional trade bloc Mercosur, over its "lack of democratic transparency". Observers noted with some interest that one of the most prominent figures at Sunday night's victory rally was the wife of the jailed Venezuelan opposition leader, Leopoldo Lopez. With legislative elections in Venezuela looming, the result in Argentina could have wider repercussions. Back on the domestic front, those of us who have spent many hours covering the case of the death of the special prosecutor, Alberto Nisman, have been intrigued by Mr Macri's vow to keep the case alive. Mr Macri again indirectly accused the outgoing administration of trying to wrap up the investigation and conclude that Mr Nisman killed himself - rather than the widespread view in Argentina that he was murdered. Less clear yet is what will be Mr Macri's stance on social and moral issues, including gay marriage, abortion and the continued pursuit of human rights abuses committed under Argentina's military rule from 1976 to 1983. At his victory rally, Mauricio Macri danced like a teenager on stage without, apparently, a care in the world. With such a full and complicated in-tray, Mr Macri is unlikely to be impersonating his beloved Freddie Mercury, the former lead singer of Queen, again for quite some time.	The most striking thing about Mauricio Macri's first news conference as president-elect of Argentina was, well, that there was a press conference at all.
Media playback is not supported on this device The new pay deal with the Rugby Football Union (RFU) means an England international will earn up to £300,000 each year in match fees alone. Along with their club salaries, bonuses and commercial income, an elite player could soon top seven figures per year. "The market place dictates what they deserve," Rugby Players' Association chief executive Hopley told BBC Sport. "If players are successful and conduct themselves in a way that is becoming to that role model status, then I think they do deserve it." The latest RFU accounts showed record profits following the 2015 Rugby World Cup. "The players generate huge amounts of money for the game," Hopley added. "In the context of the revenues being generated through English rugby, it's a very reasonable deal. "We wanted to ensure that the players felt they were participating in the commercial upside of the RFU - and despite a disappointing World Cup for everyone, we have seen a fantastic year around English rugby revenues. "England players in 2003 won £70,000 each for winning the World Cup, while players in this Old Mutual Wealth Series will pick up more than that for playing in four games for England." Mark Lambert, the vice-chairman of the RPA, denies that the new deal will lead to a disconnect between elite England players and the rest. "The way you earn respect as a rugby player is the way you carry yourself, the way you behave, and the example you set for other people," the Harlequins prop told BBC Sport. "All the [Harlequins] guys that have come through the system and gone on to represent England internationally, they are model professionals and deserve what they have achieved in the game. "We would all like to be earning that money, but it's something that's directly linked to the revenues of the RFU," added Lambert, who has made more than 200 top-flight appearances for Quins. "The RFU make a lot of money and it's only right the England players get that. There is potential for players to make a good amount of money, but you have to put in that hard work first in order to get there." The RPA last week held its quarterly board meeting with a variety of issues on the agenda, from artificial pitches to the new rugby calendar. Hopley says the players' union would fully support the notion of a fallow summer in the calendar post-2019, as revealed by the BBC in September, adding: "The players' voice is on the rise, and rightly so." Lambert said: "It is more important than ever that the players have a strong voice. "The game is expanding, there is a lot of money and there is lot of opportunity - and we need to make sure the player doesn't get pulled in too many directions. "It's an exciting time, but we have got to make sure the game stays the same at its core."	A top English player deserves to make £1m a year, says players' union boss Damian Hopley.
Police issued an alert after a complaint was made that two men were acting suspiciously near secondary schools in Carrickfergus. Mysterious pictures online of a clown and a balaclava-wearing sidekick have caused a stir in the town. The police appeal caused a backlash on social media from some people who felt they were cracking down on fun. Police said they started an investigation after receiving reports from parents that their children were frightened of the clown. A police officer wrote on the PSNI Newtownabbey and Carrickfergus Facebook page: "Fun is fun but frightening school pupils is another." The mystery man, who calls himself the Carrick "Killer Clown", contacted the police following the appeal to apologise for any distress. "He assures me that this was a prank and it was not his intention in any way to frighten the school pupils or cause distress," the officer wrote. "He fully appreciates the sensitivities of schools and photographs etc in the area of any school." Speaking to BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra programme the clown said he had been sent messages from people concerned about their children. "That wasn't the aim. The aim was for a bit of fun. I'm a parent myself," he said. "We thought this was a wonderful idea - to go and get this picture and it was only when somebody voiced their concern I was like 'this is actually wrong, this isn't even funny'. "I was talking to the police officer in charge again. I offered to go to the schools and apologize to the heads, obviously in my plain clothes, and he spoke to the heads on my behalf and they were happy with the apology through the police. So hopefully the parents will get that relayed to them." Earlier, a post on Carrick Killer Clowns' Facebook page read: "Due to the mixed response to the school pictures they have been removed - this whole thing is supposed to be a laugh and some parents find this distasteful and unfunny." However, they later posted a picture of themselves standing outside the police station in Carrickfergus.	A clown has turned himself in to the police after alarm was raised among frightened parents in County Antrim.

Officials say 80 asylum applications will be accepted each day, and a maximum of 3,200 people will be allowed to travel through Austria. The measures will be introduced on Friday. The country has become a major transit route for migrants seeking to claim asylum in Germany. Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner said Austria had no choice but to act, as there was no European solution yet in place for the current migrant crisis. "It is a matter of common sense to secure our borders as long as there is no European solution. I see it as our responsibility, to maintain security, order and the quality of life in Austria for our citizens," she said. "We cannot cope with the number of asylum applications that we had last year. That is why we impose limits on the stream of refugees. Another step is the introduction of daily quotas." Schengen: EU free movement deal explained Austria's Plan B to cap influx of refugees Migrant crisis in depth Austria took in about 90,000 asylum seekers in 2015, about 1% of its population, and officials expect to cut this number sharply this year, to about 37,500. Observers say the influx has contributed to the rising popularity of the far right in Austria, sparking tensions in the governing coalition. Neighbouring Slovenia and other countries in the Balkans - the main route for migrants bound for northern Europe - have also indicated that they will impose tougher measures against migrants. Some EU states have already re-imposed border controls on a temporary basis. The migrant flux is expected to intensify in coming months as weather conditions improve. The crisis will be high on the EU's agenda at a Brussels summit on Thursday, and countries are expected to debate the future of the Schengen Agreement that creates a 26-nation passport-free zone. Following the Austrian announcement, the Slovenian government said it had asked its parliament to approve the deployment of soldiers to its borders to help control the migrant flow.	Austria will impose a daily quota on asylum claims and limit the flux of migrants travelling through the country.

It happened at a 21st birthday party in the apartment in Berkeley, California. Five of the victims were from Ireland, and some of them were students at University College Dublin (UCD). UCD President Andrew Deeks expressed condolences to their families saying "we are heartbroken at their suffering and loss". Those who were killed have been named as: Several others have been injured, some of them very seriously. Ms Donohoe, who had dual US-Irish citizenship, lived in California while the other five who died all had home addresses in Ireland. Mr Culligan and Mr Schuster were both past-pupils of St Mary's College in Rathmines, Dublin. The majority of the victims were in the US on work visas, on the J1 USA summer work and travel programme. The families of some of the students who died have arrived in the United States from Ireland. In a statement, the UCD president said: "It is with deepest sadness that I speak of the tragic accident involving UCD students and their friends in San Francisco. "On behalf of the entire university community, I wish to extend our condolences to the families and friends of those who died and to those who were injured. "We cannot comprehend the desperate shock and grief they are feeling and we are heartbroken at their suffering and loss." UCD is opening an online Book of Condolence on its website and is offering its counselling and student support services to the bereaved in the US and Dublin. "Our students, like thousands of others across Ireland, head to the US each summer on J1 visas to enjoy the experience," Mr Deeks said. "It is heart-breaking to imagine that such a tragedy would strike these wonderful students when their lives are opening up to discover the world." In a statement on Tuesday night, St Mary's College paid tribute to its past pupils. "The thoughts and prayers of everybody in the St Mary's community are with the families of Niccolai and Eoghan, as well as the other Irish youngsters named by the US authorities this evening," the school statement said. "We also pray particularly for those injured, and their families." Ireland's Consul General in San Francisco Philip Grant said it had been a very traumatic time for everyone involved. "To have this happen at the start of this season is something that has left us all frozen in shock and disbelief," he said. "It touches every single family in Ireland." Mr Grant will lay a wreath at a ceremony near the site of the balcony collapse later. Fr Aidan McAleenan from St Columba's Church in Oakland near Berkeley, and who is originally from Banbridge, County Down, spent several hours with the injured and their friends. "It was very emotional driving out and getting to the hospital and then having to tell some of them that another friend had died," he told the BBC. "It was really hard to know what to say or what to do. We prayed with them.  Other people from the Irish community arrived. They are really devastated. That sense you have when you are totally shocked." Fr McAleenan and members of the Irish Pastoral Centre will be working closely with the families of the victims, and there will be a special Mass on Thursday. The national flag with be flown at half-mast at Irish Government Buildings as a mark of respect for those who died. A Book of Condolence will be opened at the Mansion House in Dublin later.	An Irish university has expressed "heartbreak" at the deaths of six young people who died after a balcony collapsed at a US apartment block.
Vincent Ryan, 25, was shot dead in Finglas in Dublin on Monday after he had dropped off his partner and five-month-old baby. The gunmen escaped in a silver Volkswagen Golf that was taken during a burglary in County Kildare in October. Detectives are trying to establish where the car was kept until it was found burned on Monday night. Irish police do not believe the murder of Mr Ryan, a dissident republican, is connected to the murder of David Byrne at a boxing weigh-in at a Dublin hotel last month. Mr Ryan had been charged with possession of guns linked to the fatal shooting of Dublin criminal Michael Kelly but was later acquitted, although he remained a suspect in the murder. His killing is believed to be connected to a feud between dissidents and criminals in Dublin that led to the murder of his brother Alan Ryan three-and-a-half years ago.	The getaway car used in the murder of a man in the Republic of Ireland earlier this week was stolen last year.
He is the latest casualty of the Trump White House, and takes the record for the shortest term in a top job: he was fired 10 days after being announced as communications director. But of course, there is a long line of people behind him who have been fired or eased out of their jobs by President Trump. Here's a run-down of what they did, and why they left, starting with "The Mooch". The brash, Wall Street big wig has known President Trump for years, and charismatically defended him in TV interviews. Although he didn't last long in the job, he made big headlines. He appeared to accuse Chief of Staff Reince Priebus of being responsible for White House leaks in a tweet (later deleted) that also appeared to threaten him. Mr Scaramucci then attacked Mr Priebus and President Trump's senior adviser Steve Bannon in an expletive-filled rant on the phone with a reporter from the New Yorker magazine. Why was he sacked? Although he had boasted of reporting directly to the president, Mr Scaramucci's ill-discipline may have cost him any post alongside President Trump's new chief of staff - retired, four-star General John Kelly. Mr Scaramucci's departure was announced hours after Mr Kelly was sworn-in to replace Mr Priebus. The White House said Mr Trump believed comments Mr Scaramucci had made were "inappropriate". Time in post? Ten days. (Though his official start date was 15 August - so possibly minus-15 days.) The former Republican National Committee chairman was one of few Washington veterans given a top role in the Trump White House but was unable to assert his authority. He grappled with competing powers in an administration where Mr Trump's daughter Ivanka, and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, play key roles. Mr Scaramucci was hired despite Mr Priebus's disagreement and insulted him seemingly without reproach from the president. Why was he sacked? President Trump lost confidence in him and clearly wanted a shake-up in the White House, opting for a general to replace the Republican Party operative, who was seen as weak. The announcement also came as the Republicans failed in their efforts to repeal Obamacare in the Senate. Time in post? Six months. Mr Spicer famously kicked off his tenure as White House press secretary by defending a seemingly indefensible claim about the crowd size at President Trump's inauguration. Over the course of his time behind the podium, he became - unusually for a press secretary - a household name, and was parodied on Saturday Night Live. Why did he leave? Unlike most others on this list, Mr Spicer appears to have left on seemingly good terms with the president. He stepped down after Mr Scaramucci was appointed to a role he had partially filled, saying he did not want there to be "too many cooks in the kitchen". Sarah Huckabee Sanders had also taken over many of Mr Spicer's press briefings. The New York Times reported that Mr Spicer had "vehemently" disagreed with the appointment of Mr Scaramucci, which he believed to be a "major mistake". Time in post? Six months. Mr Comey played a dramatic and controversial part in the closing stages of the election when he announced, a week before the vote, that the FBI had reopened an investigation into Hillary Clinton's private email server. He was criticised first by Democrats for the timing and alleged indiscretion of the announcement, then by Republicans when he said a week later that no charges would be brought. But Mr Trump praised the FBI director heavily, saying it "took a lot of guts" to make his announcement and that he had "brought back his reputation". He blew Mr Comey a kiss at the White House. The president grew less appreciative of him as the FBI director led an investigation into alleged ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. Why was he sacked? The Trump administration first claimed Mr Comey's handling of the Clinton email investigation rendered him no longer able to credibly lead the bureau and that Mr Trump had acted on the deputy attorney general's recommendation. However Mr Trump soon contradicted this, calling him a "showboat" in a TV interview and saying he was thinking if the "Russia thing" when he made the decision to sack him. Later it emerged that he allegedly told Russian officials that the dismissal had taken "great pressure" off him. Special counsel Robert Mueller is reported to be investigating whether obstruction of justice occurred. Time in post? Three years, eight months. Less than four months under Mr Trump. Technically, Michael Flynn resigned, but he was asked to do so by the president. His departure followed weeks of deepening scandal in which it emerged that he had misled White House officials, including the vice-president, over his contact with Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak. Mr Flynn is said to have discussed US sanctions against Russia with Mr Kislyak before Mr Trump took office. Mr Trump was briefed on the possibility that Mr Flynn was open to blackmail, because Moscow knew he was lying, but 18 days elapsed before the president sacked him, raising questions about exactly what the president knew and when. Why was he sacked? It is illegal for private citizens to conduct US diplomacy, and once it was established that Mr Flynn had lied about his contact with Mr Kislyak there was no question that he had to go. The question with this sacking was, why did it take so long? White House press secretary Sean Spicer said that the president needed the time to investigate Mr Flynn and establish his guilt, but the scandal prompted fierce speculation over what the president knew of Mr Flynn's contacts with Mr Kislyak. Time in post? 23 days. The president fired Sally Yates after she questioned the legality of Mr Trump's travel ban on seven Muslim-majority countries. Ms Yates, who was appointed by Barack Obama, believed it discriminated unconstitutionally against Muslims, and ordered justice department lawyers not to enforce the president's executive order. Within hours, she was fired. Why was she sacked? A White House statement said Ms Yates had "betrayed the Department of Justice by refusing to enforce a legal order designed to protect the citizens of the United States". It also described her as "weak on borders and very weak on illegal immigration". But it was also Ms Yates who informed White House counsel that Michael Flynn had misled the vice-president about his contacts with Ambassador Kislyak and presented a risk of Russian blackmail as a result. The president's sacking of an Obama-era holdover who had openly defied him was certainly less controversial than the Comey dismissal, but it drew heavy criticism from Democrats, who said Ms Yates had done her job in standing up to the travel ban. Time in post? 10 days. It is not uncommon for prosecutors appointed by the previous administration to be replaced as the White House changes hands, but the widely-respected Preet Bharara had been told specifically by the Trump administration that he would be kept on. Mr Bharara had built a reputation as the "Sheriff of Wall Street" after a number of aggressive prosecutions of traders. At the time of his sacking, he was overseeing several high-profile cases, including an investigation into New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio's campaign finances and allegations of sexual harassment at Trump favourite Fox News. Why was he sacked? Mr Bharara was one of 46 prosecutors asked to resign by the Trump administration, which contended that it was part of a simple changing of the guard. But there was speculation among Democrats and others that Mr Bahara's jurisdiction, which included Trump Tower, may have concerned the president. A few days before he was sacked, three ethics groups called on Mr Bharara in an open letter to investigate whether Trump companies in his jurisdiction had received foreign payments. Meanwhile, a ProPublica investigation revealed that Mr Bharara was overseeing an investigation into stock trades by Mr Trump's incoming health secretary Tom Price. Three Democratic senators wrote to attorney general Jeff Sessions asking him to investigate the Bharara sacking. Time in post? Seven years, seven months. Less than two under Mr Trump. Paul Manafort, a long-time Republican political operative, was supposed to marshal some of the chaos around Mr Trump but ended up falling prey to it. He was sacked after five months with Mr Trump's campaign, three of those as campaign chair. Why was he sacked? The Trump campaign didn't give a reason for Mr Manafort's departure, issuing only a boilerplate statement wishing him well. But a wave of reports in the week before the announcement alleged that Mr Manafort had received secret cash payments from a pro-Russian political party for representing Russian interests in Ukraine and the US. While Mr Manafort was running the campaign, the Republican Party changed the language in its manifesto regarding the conflict in Ukraine, removing anti-Russian sentiment, allegedly at the behest of two Trump campaign representatives. Time in post? Three months.	Anthony Scaramucci is out.
The news comes a day after search teams recovered the cockpit voice recorder from the wreckage of Flight MS804. Both recorders, known as the "black boxes", are crucial to discovering why the Airbus A320 came down on 19 May, killing all 66 people on board. The plane was flying from Paris to Cairo when it vanished from radar. Investigators have said it is too early to rule out any causes for the crash, including terrorism. The Egyptian investigation committee said the data recorder had been "retrieved in several pieces" by a specialist ship, the John Lethbridge. The ship, operated by Deep Ocean Search, found the plane's wreckage on Wednesday in several locations about 290km (180 miles) north of the Egyptian coast, at a depth of about 3,000m (9,800ft). The data recorder is usually located in the plane's tail along with the voice recorder, which had to be salvaged in stages on Thursday because it was badly damaged. The investigation committee said the data from the second recorder's memory unit will be downloaded once it has been transferred to the Egyptian port of Alexandria. The data recorder gathers information about the plane's speed, altitude and direction. Earlier on Friday, an unnamed official in the investigation committee told AP news agency that the voice recorder's data was already being analysed by experts, including representatives of France's air safety agency and the plane's manufacturer, Airbus. The cause of the crash remains a mystery. Egypt's civil aviation minister has said a terrorist attack is more likely than a technical failure. Automated electronic messages sent by the plane revealed that smoke detectors went off in a toilet and in the avionics area below the cockpit, minutes before the plane's signal was lost. On Monday, the investigation committee confirmed that radar data showed the plane turned 90 degrees left and then 360 degrees to the right, dropping from 11,300m (37,000ft) to 4,600m (15,000ft) and then 3,000m (10,000ft) before it disappeared. What do we know so far? Who were the victims?	The flight data recorder from the EgyptAir plane that crashed in the Mediterranean Sea last month has been retrieved, Egyptian investigators say.
The Bayern Munich player was not hurt but appeared shaken after the incident early in the second half, which forced play to be stopped for several minutes. The match in Bucharest was also interrupted for a minute at the end of the first half after fans threw flares and firecrackers on to the pitch. Poland won the Group E match 3-0. Rennes forward Kamil Grosicki's fine solo goal put the group leaders in front after 11 minutes. The two delays followed as the home crowd grew restless before Lewandowski made sure of the win late on, scoring with a composed finish in the 82nd minute before adding a third from the penalty spot in injury time. Unbeaten Poland top the group on 10 points after four matches. Montenegro, on seven points, remain in second place despite suffering their first defeat of the campaign in Armenia.

Media playback is not supported on this device The world champions, who won Britain's first gold of the London Games in 2012, led from the start as they finished 1.2 seconds clear of New Zealand in a time of seven minutes 18.29 seconds. Denmark finished third to take bronze. It was Great Britain's 17th medal of the Games and moved them up to fourth in the table, ahead of Australia. Watch: TV wildlife presenter Steve Backshall breaks down in tears as fiance Helen Glover takes gold Britain's 18th medal came just 20 minutes later as Alex Gregory, George Nash, Moe Sbihi and Constantine Louloudis took victory in the men's four. Glover and Stanning are now unbeaten in 39 races, a run that stretches back five years. They became the first British female rowers to win an Olympic title when they won four years ago, but Stanning said Friday's victory in Rio eclipsed their London success. "This means so much more," she said. "We have been so emotional this week and it means so much to us." Glover added: "The pressure was immense. London was a home games and there was nothing more special but this is defending a title - it means so much." Find out how to get into rowing with our special guide. Glover and Stanning dominated from the start, building up a 3.58s lead at the halfway mark. New Zealand surged late on but the Britons had enough in hand to take victory. "I think they had another gear," said retired rower Sir Steve Redgrave, who won gold medals at five consecutive Olympic Games. "It is difficult to repeat what they did four years ago when they had a big lead because you have to keep going through the motions of it." Singer Pixie Lott: Yessssss golden girls!!!! You're amazing BBC presenter Dan Walker: Glover and Stanning have ripped this race to bits. What a performance. Solid gold... again Former world and European champion rower Polly Swann Amazing job by @Helenglovergb and Heather! So commanding. Double Olympic champions has a nice ring to it! Well done girls.

The 22-year-old clocked 19.95 seconds representing Louisiana State University at the Southeastern Conference (SEC) Championships in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. John Regis set the British record of 19.94 in 1993, while Adam Gemili is the only other Brit to go sub 20. Mitchell-Blake told BBC Sport his achievement was "overwhelming". Regis also clocked a time of 19.87 but this was never ratified. He had already competed in two Olympic Games by the time he ran under 20 seconds. Mitchell-Blake clocked his time having already won the 100m as well as anchoring his university to victory in the 4x100m at the SEC Championships. "The 200 is my favourite event," said the 2013 European junior champion, who was visibly emotional when approached for an interview on the track.. He said he wanted to compete for Britain at the Rio Olympics in August but would be focusing on his college career for the next few weeks. "Then I'll come back to the UK and try to compete for a spot on the team," he added. Chijindu Ujah and James Ellington have also already run under the 20.50-second Olympic A standard in 2016. The British Championships take place in June.	Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake missed the national record by one-hundredth of a second as he became only the third Briton to run sub 20 seconds for 200m.
Arsenal will play Chelsea on 6 August at Wembley Stadium, and £1.25m could be raised from the match. Football Association chairman Greg Clarke said: "We hope that in some small way through the Community Shield we can help. "Football is for all, and we hope it can in its own way give something back to those who are most in need." The EFL said it would also be donating £175,000, with member clubs contributing their share of proceeds from the match. Chief executive Shaun Harvey said football was "coming together to make a significant commitment to the cause". Premier League clubs have agreed to contribute a total of £250,000. "The thoughts of everyone at the league and our clubs are with the people affected by this terrible event," a statement read. Seventy-nine people are missing or presumed dead after the blaze destroyed 150 homes in the Kensington tower block on 14 June. Survivors, the families of the victims and emergency services personnel will be invited to the game as guests.	Proceeds from the 2017 FA Community Shield will be donated to support those affected by the Grenfell Tower fire.
The powerful storm swept across the Pacific islands on Saturday leaving thousands of people homeless. Eleven people are known to have died. Planes have taken food, water and medical supplies to one of the worst-hit islands, Tanna island. But charities say much more aid will be needed in the weeks to come. People there are still in desperate need of shelter and water. Advice if you're upset by the news United Nations worker Joe Lowry, who is on Tanna, told the BBC: "We know what the needs are now on six of the islands and... everywhere else and those needs are definitively shelter and more shelter. "Where I was today they are pretty much out of fresh drinking water. "Food is in very short supply and lots of the food stocks that were there have been damaged. The food that was growing above ground was all swept away." Aid workers reached Tanna for the first time on Tuesday and reported 80% of homes or buildings had been partially or completely destroyed. "There's a landscape of skeleton trees and patchworks of square outlines where houses used to be," said Angus Hohenboken from aid group Oxfam. He added that the fierce winds had uprooted water tanks and blown them miles away. Crops were demolished and electricity was out. Baldwin Lonsdale, Vanuatu's president, returned to his country on Tuesday night. He'd been in Japan attending a UN conference when the cyclone hit. "I trust the people of Vanuatu. I trust my government. I trust the people that they will stand united together as a nation and to rebuild the nation," he said.	Emergency aid is beginning to reach some of the worst-hit islands of Vanuatu, helping people there after a cyclone destroyed whole villages.
Kent County Council said the continuing flow of unaccompanied asylum-seeking children (UASC) from across the English Channel had left it with no choice. The authority currently has 924 such children in its care, compared with nearly 630 at the start of last August. Councillor Peter Oakford said it was "not a position we want to be in". The cabinet member for specialist children's services said Kent County Council had seen a 30% rise in looked-after children in the past seven months. Other authorities elsewhere in the UK have accepted full responsibility for 56 unaccompanied asylum-seeking children. Mr Oakford told the children's social care and health cabinet committee: "This has affected our ability to place citizen children within Kent ourselves. "We have had to place Kent children outside of Kent due to the influx of UASC, which is not a good position to be in and is not a position we want to be in. "It's actually costing us more financially because we have had to place, I think, six children into residential care either short-term or longer term, which is far more expensive than normal foster care." The council's services have been stretched since the start of the migrant crisis last summer as Kent is the closest British county to Calais and Dunkirk. The number of child asylum seekers coming into its care has slowed to about 15 a week during the winter, but Mr Oakford said if that increased with the arrival of the warmer months the authority would be "in significant difficulties".	Vulnerable children are being placed in care outside their home county of Kent due to the influx of child asylum seekers, according to council chiefs.
The fine follows the conviction of former RBS trader, Shirlina Tsang, for fraud last year. She was sentenced to 50 months in prison after being caught falsifying records of emerging markets trades. Hong Kong regulators said RBS's controls were "seriously inadequate". The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) also said there were "significant weaknesses in its procedures, management systems and internal controls." But the regulator said the fine took into account the bank's speedy action in alerting the authorities once it had discovered the illegal trades, which took place in its emerging markets rates business in 2011. "This deserves substantial credit and is the reason why today's sanctions are not heavier ones," Mark Steward, the SFC's head of enforcement, said in a statement. RBS responded with a statement, reading: "We put in place a comprehensive remediation programme that strengthened our governance and supervisory oversight, and our control environment." The fine is relatively small compared to others the bank has received in the last few years. In December RBS agreed to pay 391m euros (£320m) in penalties to the European Commission for its role in the attempted rigging of Yen Libor and Euribor - the Tokyo and euro equivalents of the London interbank offered rate, or Libor. In the same month it was fined $100m (£60m) by US regulators for violations of US sanctions against Iran, Sudan, Burma, and Cuba. The bank was found to have removed location information on payments made to US financial institutions from countries such as Iran and Cuba.	Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) has been fined HK$6m (£460,000) by Hong Kong regulators after it failed to detect a series of unauthorised transactions by one of its traders.
The FBI has ordered Apple to disable the security software on a dead murderer's iPhone but the tech giant has refused. Mark Zuckerberg said he did not believe the authorities should have backdoors to bypass encryption protection. However, a lawyer representing some of the gunman's victims has backed the federal bureau. Stephen Larson, a former judge, said he intended to file legal paperwork next month telling Apple to co-operate. "They were targeted by terrorists, and they need to know why, how this could happen," he added. He declined to say how many of the victims he was representing, but did add that he would not be charging them a fee. Mr Zuckerberg made his comments at the Mobile World Congress tech show in Barcelona. "I don't think that requiring back doors to encryption is either going to be an effective thing to increase security or is really the right thing to do," he said. "We are pretty sympathetic to Tim [Cook] and Apple." He added that Facebook was committed to doing all it could to prevent terrorism but his company was in favour of encryption. The social network had previously issued a statement saying that the court order could create a "chilling precedent". Leaders at Google and Twitter also voiced support for Apple last week. Fourteen people were killed and 22 injured when gunman Syed Rizwan Farook and his wife Tashfeen Malik opened fire in California last December. Apple's chief executive Tim Cook has described the FBI's order as "dangerous" and "unprecedented". He has said the firm would have to build a new operating system in order to comply. "We strongly believe the only way to guarantee that such a powerful tool isn't abused and doesn't fall into the wrong hands is to never create it," the firm stated in a Q&A on the Apple website. In a statement published on Sunday, the FBI Director James Comey said the demand was "about the victims and justice". "We simply want the chance, with a search warrant, to try to guess the terrorist's passcode without the phone essentially self-destructing and without it taking a decade to guess correctly," the FBI director wrote. "That's it. We don't want to break anyone's encryption or set a master key loose on the land. "Maybe the phone holds the clue to finding more terrorists. Maybe it doesn't. But we can't look the survivors in the eye, or ourselves in the mirror, if we don't follow this lead." Last week anti-virus creator John McAfee offered to unlock the iPhone for the FBI. "It will take us three weeks," he told Business Insider, adding that he would eat his shoe on television if his team failed.	Facebook's chief executive has said he is sympathetic to Apple's position in its clash with the FBI.
It says officers who file complaints are labelled as "troublemakers" and pressured to leave the force. A separate, unpublished police report has said disproportionate numbers of minority officers in some forces end up in the disciplinary system. The Association of Chief Police Officers says the data is "worrying". Speaking to Radio 4's             File on 4  programme, President of the NBPA Charles Critchlow said: "I think the worst aspect is it appears that even senior officers are prepared to use instruments within the service, for example the disciplinary process, to put pressure on these officers and ultimately force them out of the organisation and that's something that we're very, very concerned about." He added: "I think there still exists within the police service a pattern of behaviour where officers, particularly junior officers, who make a complaint or challenge inappropriate behaviour - particularly if it's got anything to do with race - seem to be labelled as troublemakers." However, Mr Critchlow also stressed: "That is not to say that all officers are racist or discriminate against people, but there seems to be a problem in the police service when it comes to dealing with race issues." The BBC has also seen an internal draft report which shows police disciplinary procedures being used disproportionately against black and Asian officers in some forces. The report was compiled by academic researchers on behalf of Greater Manchester Police and includes data from the West Midlands Police and the British Transport Police. It acknowledges concerns from minority officers about unfair treatment and confirms that in the West Midlands, black and minority ethnic (BME) officers are almost twice as likely to be the subject of an investigation as white officers. Findings for the British Transport Police are broadly similar. The research also looks at officers being kept under surveillance in internal counter-corruption investigations and found that in Greater Manchester the proportion of minority officers being investigated is three times higher than that of white officers.

Contact the File on 4 team In the West Midlands, the rate of allegations of corruption against BME officers is more than five times higher than the rate of allegations against white officers. The authors of the report are calling for further research and say their findings suggest the problems identified are not limited to the three forces featured in the research. Chief Constable of Bedfordshire Police Alfred Hitchcock, who is the Association of Chief Police Officers lead on equality, diversity and human rights, says he has not yet seen the internal report but says the data is "worrying". He told the BBC he would be speaking to other chief officers about the matter, but defended the way internal complaints are dealt with. "If there are matters relating to racist or improper behaviour, then those are investigated and people who are victims are treated as victims. "The service is very keen to make sure that we deal properly and appropriately with all staff and by doing that we would hope that people see us as being fair with all, and that is the objective," he said. File on 4's investigation also uncovered concerns about the slow progress forces have made in recruiting and promoting BME officers. Thirteen years after the Stephen Lawrence Inquiry recommended increased numbers of black and ethnic minority officers, the latest Home Office figures show more BME officers are leaving the police than joining. In 2010-11, 165 BME officers were recruited, but 204 left the service. Mr Hitchcock blames government cuts on police funding which has led to a recruitment freeze and subsequently a dip in numbers, but acknowledges the police leadership must do more: "If some people think that we've got this sorted I think they're living in a dream world. I think there is an awful lot of work for us still to do. "There is a danger that we put an over-negative spin on where we've come in the last decade because actually we've made fantastic progress. But that doesn't mean we stop; that means we actually need to renew and re-energise."

Police forces are unfairly disciplining black and Asian officers who complain about racism, says the National Black Police Association.
"Caucasian Heritage Night: Irish, Italian, Scandinavian, German --- or even Utahn! Whatever your background, celebrate it at the Home of the Owlz!" a calendar entry reads. Other promotions included "Christmas in August" and "Throwback Night". The team is associated with the Angels, a major league team in California. "Our goal in this promotion, like any of our promotions, is to have fun and make fun of everyday normalcies," the team said. "Our night was to include wonder bread on burgers with mayonnaise, clips from shows like Friends and Seinfeld and trying to solve the vertical leaping challenge. "We understand, in light of recent tragic events, that our intentions have been misconstrued. For that, we sincerely apologise." On Wednesday night, nine people were shot dead in an African-American church in South Carolina in what police termed a hate crime. The Owlz are a rookie-league team - the most entry level division of the minor leagues. The league is designed for new players hone their skills. On Friday, "Caucasian Heritage Night" quickly became a top trending term on Twitter in the US.	A minor league baseball team in Utah has cancelled plans to host a "Caucasian Heritage Night" in August, according to the team's website.
Dorothy Leyden's body was found hours after she had been to a Jimmy Ruffin concert at the Golden Garter nightclub in Wythenshawe in April 1971. The 17-year-old's body was found on waste ground in Collyhurst. Her sister Pat Atkinson has made an emotional appeal for more information on her death. The teenager spent the evening of 24 April 1971 at the concert before heading into central Manchester. At about 02:30, she got out of a taxi she had shared with friends at Piccadilly Gardens bus station and it is thought she decided to walk home. Her body was found the following day behind the now demolished Spread Eagle pub. A reconstruction will show some of Dorothy's last known movements before she was attacked. Previously, it had been thought she may have been murdered by serial killer Trevor Hardy but, this was dismissed in 2008. Det Supt Martin Bottomley, from Greater Manchester Police, said forensic evidence proved he did not kill Dorothy. "The suspicion that Hardy was responsible may have allowed the real killer to hide for all of this time." Dorothy's sister recalled the moment officers broke the news of her sister's murder. She told Crimewatch: "I remember the police coming to the front door and I just went out playing and when I came home my mum called me into the living room. "I think she told us all one at a time and she just told me that Dorothy had been beaten and she'd died." The appeal will be shown on Crimewatch later on BBC One at 21:00 BST.	A fresh appeal to find the killer of a teenage girl who was raped and murdered in Manchester 45 years ago is to feature on BBC One's Crimewatch.
Rooney, 30, played in midfield rather than as a striker and came under fire following the shock defeat by Iceland. "He's our talisman, he's our greatest goalscorer, he's experienced and you don't want that to walk away at this stage," Lampard told BBC Sport. "I would want him in the team and in the squad. He has certainly got another tournament in him." Rooney has scored a record 53 goals in 115 appearances for his country. The Manchester United man was made England captain in August 2014 but has come under scrutiny for a number of disappointing displays. He found the net from the penalty spot after just four minutes against Iceland but underperformed for most of the game in Nice as England went out of Euro 2016 at the last-16 stage. In the wake of the defeat, Germany legend Lothar Matthaus said it was time for Rooney to retire from international football. "Sadly, when his team needed him, Rooney was not that leader," he said. "You need someone who can provide the impetus and rhythm. I thought Rooney could take the role but, when it mattered, he wasn't able to do it." Media playback is not supported on this device "I think once we reflect a bit more, Wayne will remain a big player in the squad and will help with the development of the younger players around him," insisted Lampard, who won 106 caps for England. However, the former Chelsea and West Ham midfielder thinks he needs to work out his best position for both club and country. Under Louis van Gaal, Rooney began to play in midfield as well as a striker but that may change now Jose Mourinho is manager of Manchester United. "I don't believe 31 is an age where you need to change position because of being 31, said Lampard, now playing in the United States with New York City. "I think Wayne still has the pace, the ability and the knowhow to play as a striker, but the choice will obviously be between him and his managers." Rooney has already said he would continue to be available for international selection. England's next game is a 2018 World Cup qualifier in Slovakia on 4 September. England should not be afraid of appointing another foreign coach as a successor to Roy Hodgson, said Lampard, who played under Swede Sven-Goran Eriksson and Italian Fabio Capello during his time with the national side. "Ideally, as a proud Englishman, you'd love an English manager," he said. "But I think, in the modern world, you have to accept that, if the options aren't there, you have to look abroad. "It wouldn't bother me if a foreign manager took an England team forward and was successful, not at all." England are looking for a new manager as Englishman Hodgson quit immediately after the defeat by Iceland. Under Eriksson, England reached the quarter-finals at three successive major tournaments, while Capello led England to the 2010 World Cup and a 4-1 defeat by Germany in the second round. "I think the best man for the job would be the starting point for picking the next manager," added Lampard, who would prefer a youthful boss, adding: "Over the last 10-15 years, when I was playing, we weren't setting a new tone. "I would look to a younger, forward-thinking manager who has a real strong idea about how he wants to play, plays good football, generates a good spirit in the team and go that way." But he believes it will not be a straightforward task for the Football Association. "I can't give you the name, which is the problem, but they will have to have a confidence in the decision they make," said Lampard. "They'll have to give him free reign to try to mould these good young players into a team that can fight at the top level."	Wayne Rooney still has a future with England despite their Euro 2016 failure, says Frank Lampard.
Police were called to Oxlow Lane, Dagenham, at 23:00 BST on Saturday after reports of a street fight. Officers recovered three large knives, scissors and cannabis from the "large and unpredictable" crowd, they said. Two boys aged 17 and 15 were arrested - one on suspicion of possessing an offensive weapon and the other on suspicion of an assault on police. Scotland Yard said no one had been injured at the event. Insp Jason O'Donohue said: "By getting these knives off the street when they did, my officers have helped save lives and prevented another needless tragedy."	Two teenagers have been arrested and three knives recovered after 300 people attended a house party in east London.
Josh Hanson, of Kingsbury, north-west London, was stabbed in the neck at the RE bar in Eastcote, Hillingdon. He died at the scene shortly after 01:10 BST on Sunday. Scotland Yard said about 40 people were in the bar at the time of the attack and urged anyone there after midnight to contact them with information. No arrests have yet been made. Det Ch Insp Noel McHugh said: "It is believed there would have been around 40 people present at the time of the incident, many of whom left the venue as paramedics worked to save Josh's life. It is imperative these people contact us to let us know what they saw. "We are also keen to hear from anyone who was in Field End Road area at around 01:00 Sunday who may have seen or heard anything that they now think might be because of the incident at the RE bar."	A murder investigation has begun over a man who was fatally stabbed in front of dozens of customers at an over-21s bar in north-west London.
The unnamed man was one of 16 people arrested in raids on Sunday. The rest have been released without charge. Belgian PM Charles Michel said he would maintain the highest security threat level in Brussels, warning of an imminent threat. But authorities plan to reopen schools and the metro on Wednesday. The co-ordinated assaults in Paris on 13 November - claimed by so-called Islamic State (IS) - left 130 people dead. A statement from the federal prosecutor's office said the man had been charged with "participating in activities of a terrorist group and with [a] terrorist attack". Of a further five people arrested on Monday morning, two have been released, while "further enquiries" are under way regarding the others, the prosecutor said. Mohammed Amri, 27, and Hamza Attou, 20, have already been charged with aiding Paris attacks suspect Salah Abdeslam, who remains at large. A third, unnamed suspect has also been charged. In a separate development, French police said an object that appeared to be an explosives belt was found in a bin in the Paris suburb of Montrouge on Monday. The item is being examined. Mobile phone data suggest that Salah Abdeslam - whose brother died in the attacks - was in that area late on the night of the attack. Today I walked through the Royal Gallery of St Hubert, the iconic, beautifully ornate shopping arcade in the heart of Brussels. I counted on one hand the number of shoppers. Only one of the famous chocolatiers has opened, with armed soldiers guarding outside, and it has barely any customers. Two Danish tourists select some delicate, pastel macarons, looking over their shoulders as I enter. "We can admit we're scared," Delilah tells me, "We were told by the hotel manager not to come here, but we thought we'd take a chance. Buy presents for the family and leave quickly." Eva, behind the counter, says her boss told her she could have the day off if she was afraid, but decided to come in. "I feel I'd be letting myself down if I didn't come in today, even if no-one comes in to be served," she says. Universities, schools, large stores, shopping centres and the metro system were closed in Brussels on Monday as the highest security alert remained in place for a third day. Armed police patrolled the normally bustling streets of the capital. Announcing that the state of alert would remain at level four for another week, Mr Michel stressed "we must all progressively get back to a normal life". The rest of Belgium remains on alert level three, meaning an attack is seen as possible and credible. France has stepped up security in schools, imposing a series of measures including compulsory safety drills and banning parking outside school premises. Also on Monday, France carried out its first strikes against IS from its Charles de Gaulle aircraft carrier, newly deployed in the eastern Mediterranean. French jets bombed IS targets in Iraq and Syria, including Raqqa, IS's key Syrian stronghold, the defence ministry said. Interview transcript: 'My brothers were manipulated, not radicalised' Paris attacks: The unanswered questions Paris attacks: Who were the victims? Who were the Paris attackers? Special report: In-depth coverage of the attacks and their aftermath President Francois Hollande has vowed to intensify strikes against IS in Syria and Iraq in the wake of the attacks. On Monday morning Mr Hollande and UK Prime Minister David Cameron paid their respects to the victims at a makeshift memorial in front of the Bataclan theatre venue. Speaking after talks at the Elysee Palace, Mr Cameron said it was his "firm conviction" that the UK should join air strikes in Syria - but that the decision would be up to MPs.	Belgian police have charged a fourth suspect with terrorism offences related to the deadly attacks on Paris, the federal prosecutor has said.
Rita Wharton died when her car was hit after Anita Corless tried to overtake traffic near Welshpool, Powys. Corless, 58, originally from Milford Haven in Pembrokeshire, admitted causing death by dangerous driving. She was given a 16-month prison sentence at Mold Crown Court. The driving instructor said she had no memory of the fatal manoeuvre on the A483 road between Welshpool and Pool Quay, last March. The court heard on Tuesday how she was in a line of traffic on a straight stretch of road when she pulled out but there was insufficient room and she caused the crash. Mrs Wharton's Ford Ka, the second in line, was struck by two vehicles. A widow, said to be the lynchpin of the family, Mrs Wharton was declared dead at the scene. "You quite inexplicably drove your vehicle into the face of on-coming traffic in an overtaking manoeuvre that was obviously dangerous," said Judge Niclas Parry. "On-coming vehicles should have been visible to a careful driver. "You are by profession a driving instructor, employed by Lancashire County Council to run speed awareness courses." Speed awareness courses are offered by councils and police forces across Britain to avoid penalties for minor speeding offences. Corless, who was living in Bentham in North Yorkshire at the time of the incident, was herself seriously injured in the crash. The judge told her it was a thoroughly-avoidable fatality which "must be marked by a custodial sentence". In addition to the 16-month jail sentence, Corless was banned from driving for two-years and eight-months, and must take an extended driving test before being allowed back on the roads. The court was told that, despite her age, Mrs Wharton still worked as the head housekeeper at a pub in Powys, and lived her life like a woman in her 50s. In family impact statements, victim she was described by her daughter Diane Dunderdale as "my best friend and my rock".	A driving instructor heading to teach a speed awareness class has been jailed for causing a five-car smash that killed an 83-year-old woman.
Lee Novak put the Spireites ahead, nodding in Gboly Ariyibi's cross, for his 14th goal of the season before Adam Hammill's deflected equaliser. Jamal Campbell-Ryce was dismissed for two yellow cards, one for kicking the ball away, but Ollie Banks side-footed home to restore Chesterfield's lead. Hamill then hit the post as Barnsley could not find a late leveller. Defeat in their first league game since winning the Johnstone's Paint Trophy means Barnsley are now six points off the League One play-off positions. Chesterfield, meanwhile, have now opened up a four-point gap between themselves and the relegation places.	Ten-man Chesterfield edged out Barnsley to boost their own survival chances and dent their hosts' play-off ambitions.
His comments, made during a closed-session meeting in the Hungarian capital Budapest, were accidentally broadcast to reporters. He said the EU was the only major power to attach "political" conditions to its relationship with Israel. This, he said, was damaging to the bloc's security and economic interests. The EU has repeatedly condemned Israel's building of Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank. In comments picked up on the headphones of reporters waiting outside the meeting, Mr Netanyahu told the prime ministers of Hungary, the Czech Republic, Poland and Slovakia: "The European Union is the only association of countries in the world that conditions the relations with Israel... on political conditions. The only ones." He was referring to the EU's insistence on terms relating to the Israeli-Palestinian peace process being included in its Association Agreement with Israel, signed in 2000 and not subsequently updated. "It's crazy. It's actually crazy," he said. "It's not about my interest. I'm talking about Europe's interest. "We have a special relationship with China. And they don't care. They don't care about the political issues." He added that India and Russia had a similar approach, and urged the four prime ministers to push for a deal on a new Association Agreement. "There is no logic here. The EU is undermining its security by undermining Israel. Europe is undermining its progress by undermining its connection with Israeli innovation by a crazy attempt to create conditions." He added: "I think Europe has to decide if it wants to live and thrive or if it wants to shrivel and disappear. "I am not very politically correct. I know that's a shock to some of you. It's a joke. But the truth is the truth. Both about Europe's security and Europe's economic future. Both of these concerns mandate a different policy toward Israel." Mr Netanyahu also criticised the policies of former US President Barack Obama's administration, saying things had improved since Donald Trump took office. "We had a big problem. I think its different now. Vis-a-vis Iran, there is a stronger position. The US is more engaged in the region and conducting more bombings." He also admitted that Israel had carried out dozens of attacks against Iranian-backed militia group Hezbollah's arms convoys in Syria. "I told [Russian President Vladimir] Putin, when we see them transferring weapons to Hezbollah, we will hurt them. We did it dozens of times," he said. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who has been an outspoken opponent of  Muslim immigration to Europe, later told reporters: "We share Israel's notion of protecting external borders. If Europe does not co-operate with Israel, it is punishing itself."	Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has condemned the European Union's "crazy" approach to dealing with his country.
The two music stars have been arguing ever since falling out over some backing singers three years ago. Their feud remains unresolved, with Taylor finally putting her music on Spotify on Friday - the very same day that Katy released her new album. But this week, Katy said: "There are bigger fish to fry, and there are real problems in the world. You know what I'm saying? I love her, and I want the best for her." The pair are hardly the first musicians to publicly lock horns, and in an age of Twitter there are more platforms than ever for the stars to trade barbs. Here are just a few other high-profile musical battles. Katy Perry isn't the only person to have found herself caught in a Swift storm. Taylor's beef with Kanye West dates back to 2009 - specifically, that year's MTV Video Music Awards. Kanye wasn't too impressed with Taylor winning video of the year for You Belong With Me. And, let's be honest, Kanye is not the type of chap to suffer in silence. The rapper took to the stage during Taylor's acceptance speech, grabbed the microphone, and said: "Taylor, I'm really happy for you, and I'ma let you finish, but Beyonce had one of the best videos of all time!" He was talking about Bey's Single Ladies, which to be fair really was a masterpiece of filmmaking. But this perhaps wasn't quite the time or the place to start that debate. The pair later made up, but a few years down the line West claimed in his single Famous that the run-in had helped Swift's career. Taylor claimed she had never given West's lyrics her blessing, but then the rapper's wife Kim Kardashian got involved, posting a Snapchat which appeared to show Taylor doing just that. At the 2016 Grammys, Swift responded: "I want to say to all the young women out there - there are going to be people along the way who are going to try to undercut your success or take credit for your accomplishments or your fame." But, she advised her fans: "Just focus on the work and you don't let those people sidetrack you." If a new female rapper arrives on the music scene and Lil' Kim (above left) doesn't start a fight with her - did she ever even exist? Kim has history with Eve, Foxy Brown, Remy Ma and many more... but those were small fry compared to when Nicki Minaj appeared in the late noughties. Nicki's debut album Pink Friday was a massive success when it was released in 2010, but Lil' Kim opted not to send flowers. In a diss track she put out online called Black Friday, Kim described Nicki as a "Lil' Kim wannabe" who was "trying to clone my style". Minaj, naturally, responded with a diss track of her own, called Stupid Hoe. Which drew attention to the fact that her records were "shipping platinum" while Kim remained "busted" and "crusty". As a band, Oasis were no strangers to scrapes. The infamous chart battle of 1995 saw Oasis's Roll With It go up against Blur's Country House in a race for the number one spot - a contest Blur eventually won. The competition was so high-profile it even made headline news, much to the bemusement of a somewhat younger-looking John Humphrys. But there was another Oasis feud was still to come - this time an internal one. In 2009, the year Noel quit the band, he told Q his brother Liam was "rude, arrogant, intimidating, and lazy", adding: "He's the angriest man you'll ever meet. He's like a man with a fork in a world of soup." Last year, Liam said Noel was absent from the premiere of a documentary film about the band because he was probably in one of his "really big houses, eating tofu and having a face peel". Their brotherly battle rumbled on last week, when Liam criticised Noel for not appearing at One Love Manchester - a concert to benefit the victims of the suicide bombing in the city. But Noel defended himself by saying he was never asked to play at the show, adding that he'd donated the royalties from Don't Look Back In Anger to the Red Cross's Manchester Emergency Fund. Zayn Malik had everything a young man could wish for at the height of One Direction's success - fame, money and worldwide adoration. But the man responsible for 20% of the group's success left Louis, Liam, Niall and Harry behind in 2015 to pursue a solo career. Zayn began working on some new material with Naughty Boy - the producer famous for his work with Emeli Sande and Sam Smith. But it's fair to say that he and Zayn didn't quite hit it off in the same way. "Naughty Boy you fat joke stop pretending we're friends no one knows you," tweeted Zayn after their recording sessions turned sour. Mr Boy later told The Guardian the 22-year-old was "throwing his toys out of the pram" and said they had fallen out over "external influences". Hate it when that happens. The number of artists which Azealia Banks (above left) has fallen out with is so huge that it's difficult to single out just one. But somebody who experienced a particularly high level of vitriol was Fancy singer Iggy Azalea. For two artists who became popular around the same time and were only a couple of letters off sharing a name, perhaps comparisons and rivalries were inevitable. It all kicked off when XXL magazine put Iggy on the cover of their annual freshman issue, which looks at the hottest newcomers in music every year. Banks was not a massive fan of this editorial decision. She said the magazine was "wrong" to include Iggy and went on to accuse her nemesis of appropriating black culture. Iggy Azalea responded by saying: "You can't block my blessings, today I'm celebrating, get on with it or kick rocks." The battle rumbled on for years, with Iggy claiming in 2014 that her huge chart success was the only reason Banks was still getting any publicity. In the early 2000s, rap feuds were all the rage. Nas and Jay Z. DMX and Ja Rule. 50 Cent and All Other Rappers. But one of the most high-profile involved the biggest name in music at the time and the slightly less famous Benzino - a rapper and co-owner of hip-hop magazine The Source. Benzino put out a track dissing Eminem called Pull Your Skirt Up, which described Eminem as a "2003 Vanilla Ice" and compared him to a woman. Which is the ultimate insult, considering women are lesser human beings, right? (Apparently Benzino was born in 1859). Eminem retaliated with his own diss track, Nail in the Coffin, in which he said: "Nobody wants to hear their grandfather rap." Probably best to finish on one that has a happy ending. RiRi and CiCi, as they should never have been nicknamed, both launched their careers in 2005 - with Ciara topping the charts with Goodies and Rihanna hitting number two with Pon De Replay. They were the young bright hopes of R&B and even went on tour together. But a few years later things turned sour. "I ran into her recently at a party and she wasn't the nicest," explained Ciara in 2011. "It wasn't the most pleasant run-in." There then followed the most glorious of Twitter exchanges. Rihanna: "My bad Ci, did I forget to tip you?" Ciara: "Trust me Rihanna you don't want to see me on or off the stage." Rihanna: "You gangsta huh?... Good luck with booking that stage you speak of." Ouch. But it didn't take long for Rihanna to backtrack, writing: "Ciara baby, I love you girl! You hurt my feelings real bad on TV, that's why I retaliated this way. So sorry!" Ciara graciously responded: 'Rhi, u know its always been love since day one! You threw me off in that party! Apology accepted. Let's chat in person." Now isn't that lovely. Let's all be friends.

Katy Perry has said she's ready to put an end to the bad blood which has existed between her and Taylor Swift for the past few years.
Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he said: "The only response can be: 'yes, Mr President'." Gen Petraeus resigned as CIA director in 2012 following an extramarital affair with his biographer. It later emerged he had shared classified material with her. He served as a senior officer under Presidents Bush and Obama. He was the commander of US and Nato forces in Afghanistan, before retiring from the military to take the top position in the Central Intelligence Agency. Asked if he thought Mr Trump had the correct temperament to be the US President, he said: "It's up to Americans at this point in time not only to hope that that is the case, but if they can, endeavour to help him." He then indicated he would personally serve under Mr Trump if asked. "If you're asked, you've got to serve - put aside any reservations based on campaign rhetoric... and figure out what's best for the country," he said. "I've been in a position before where a president has turned to me in the Oval Office in a difficult moment, without any pleasantries, and said 'I'm asking you as your president and Commander in Chief to take command of the international security force in Afghanistan.' "The only response can be: 'yes, Mr President,'" he continued. A number of media outlets have linked the retired general with positions in the new administration. A report in The Guardian last week linked Gen Petraeus to the race for secretary of state, citing diplomatic sources. Mr Trump has been putting together his administration made up of friends, family, and former rivals - but several key positions, including secretary of state, remain open. General Petraeus was indirectly critical of some of Donald Trump's rhetoric during the presidential election campaign, describing the president elect's anti-Muslim comments as toxic. However, he said he had heard good things from those who have been speaking with Mr Trump since the election result. "It's interesting that those who have been talking to him have said, you know, he's very personable, very hospitable, very gracious guy, full of questions and dialogue," he said. He also suggested that Mr Trump could forge closer ties with Russia, comparing his political position to that of President Nixon's overtures to China in the 1970s. "Only Nixon could have gone to China. Anyone else would have been criticised from the right," he said. "I think that the current president would have been criticised from the right had he tried some of the kinds of outreach that, in fact, President-elect Trump may pursue." But he warned that any such outreach should be attempted "with your eyes wide open".	General David Petraeus, one of the United States' most prominent military officers, has indicated he would be willing to serve in President-elect Donald Trump's administration if asked.
The incident took place close to Caernarfon's Crown Court and fire station just before 09:00 BST on Thursday. The mother-of-five was airlifted to hospital in Stoke-on-Trent. North Wales Police has said her 46-year-old partner has been arrested. "This is being treated as a domestic-related crime but I would like to reassure the community that a swift arrest was made," said Det Chf Insp Iestyn Davies. The Welsh Ambulance Service said they were called at 09:00 BST to reports that a woman had been assaulted. Police said the victim remains in a serious but stable condition. Forensic investigations are being carried out at the location, which links nearby estates to a local primary and secondary school.	A mother walking her children to school in north Wales is in hospital with serious injuries after being attacked on a busy footpath.
Stocktrade is being transferred to the Dundee-headquartered firm for £14m in cash. Its most recent annual revenue was £9m, with £1.3m in pre-tax profit. Last September, Stocktrade had £4.3bn of assets under management. The buyer said it now stands at £4.6bn, bringing 48,000 new customers. That should increase the scale of Alliance Trust Savings to £11.5bn in assets under management, with 105,000 customers, allowing for more efficient operations. It will also increase the Dundonians range of services, including telephone and online share dealing services for pension providers, building societies, company share schemes and corporate Individual Savings Accounts. Brewin Dolphin said the sale would only clear a net gain of £1m, after paying for separation costs. The deal still requires clearance from regulators, and is expected to close during this year. Alliance Trust Savings was part of the strategy last month criticised by Elliott Advisers, the hedge fund and activist investor in parent company Alliance Trust. In criticising the Dundee company's management, it succeeded in getting two new directors appointed. They could have sought to block further expansion of the financial retail platform. But it appears, from this deal, that they have agreed to expenditure on growth. Alliance Trust believes that the expansion could help its savings division into profit by 2016, apart from the cost of integration. Patrick Mill, managing director of Alliance Trust Savings (ATS), said: "Stocktrade is a great strategic fit for ATS, giving us access to new customers, an increase in assets and the opportunity to build a strategic partnership capability. "It also gives us the ability to align a traditional stockbroking business with our innovative, scalable and cost effective approach by offering customers online access alongside our in-house customer service team."	Alliance Trust Savings has announced plans to buy an Edinburgh-based share trading company from Brewin Dolphin.
The Department for Transport said up to 60 trains, capable of speeds of about 225mph, were needed. The contract, which will also involve maintaining the fleet, will be awarded in 2019. The trains are for the first phase of the project, due to open in 2026 and run between London and Birmingham. Construction will begin later this year and it is expected to reduce rail times between Birmingham and London by 32 minutes. A second Y-shaped phase of HS2 will open in two stages. The line from Birmingham to Crewe will launch in 2027, with the remaining construction - which includes a spur taking HS2 to a new station at Manchester Airport - due to finish six years later. There will be separate contracts in the future to supply trains for this phase. Transport secretary Chris Grayling said the new railway would carry more than 300,000 people a day. "Hundreds of jobs will be created in building and maintaining these trains, representing a great opportunity for British-based businesses and suppliers. "In total 25,000 jobs and 2,000 apprenticeships will be created during HS2 construction and we have held discussions with UK suppliers to make sure they are in the best possible position to win contracts," he added. Friday's launch comes ahead of a formal start of the process in spring 2017, when companies interested in bidding can learn more about the process. Formal invitations to tender will be made in 2018. Hitachi Rail Europe said it will bid for the contract to build the HS2 trains. The rail manufacturer is headquartered in London and builds trains at its plant in Newton Aycliffe in County Durham. Its sales director, Nick Hughes, said: "Our HS2 trains would be built in Britain, for Britain, and combine world-leading Japanese Shinkansen technology with British manufacturing know-how." Gordon Wakeford, managing director of Siemens Mobility, said a manufacturing contract of this scale  was "exciting news" for the rail industry and would have a "positive impact on the wider UK supply chain". The company had recently "ramped up" its HS2 activity with the appointment of two executives to lead the HS2 rolling stock bid team, he added. HS2 has been dogged by controversy, with critics saying the scheme poses a threat to swathes of English countryside.	The search for a company to take on the £2.75bn contract to build high speed trains for the HS2 rail network got underway on Friday.
Prof Colin Riordan, the chair of Universities Wales and vice-chancellor of Cardiff University, said the policy of paying the majority of Welsh students' tuition fees has to change. He wants it replaced with a means tested grant to help poorer students. The Welsh government said its tuition fee policy has been a "huge success". Prof Riordan told BBC Wales' The Wales Report TV programme: "If you took the same approach to the tuition fee grant, as you do with maintenance grants, you could free up considerable funding to allow Welsh universities to compete in the same way as other universities in the UK and that's really critical to the future of our country. "There is no limit to the number of students that can go to university which means there is no limit to the money that is needed to fund the tuition fee policy and that means there is not enough money to fund Welsh universities." Yesterday, First Minister Carwyn Jones defended the Welsh government's university tuition fees subsidy and rejected the idea that tuition fee support should be limited to Welsh students who study at universities in Wales rather than anywhere they study in the UK. He was responding to Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood who said the current policy meant too much Welsh public money ended up going to English universities. On Sunday, outgoing Education Minister Huw Lewis told BBC Wales tuition fee grants would remain in place after May's assembly election if Labour retained power. Universities in Wales get the majority of their funding through the tuition fees paid by students. They also get an amount from the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales (HEFCW), around Â£90m a year, which has been cut this year by the Welsh government. Prof Riordan said it had seen a 40% cut to funding which would result in job losses and would affect students. "The critical part is that the government needs to make sure than enough money is still available to fund all the areas that the tuition fee grant can't fund and that means making sure that funding is available to ensure that Welsh universities can continue to be the great success they've been over recent years," he said. "The future prosperity of the people of Wales is in the knowledge economy and the universities are the building blocks of that economy". A Welsh government spokesperson said: "There is no doubt that we have had to make some tough decisions within this budget and we  recognise that the cut to HEFCW will present challenges. "We stand by our tuition fee grant policy which has been a huge success, has supported our learners to study a course and at an institution that is right for them, and has meant that Welsh graduates have left university with debts that are on average Â£22,000 lower than graduates from England." The Wales Report is on BBC1 Wales at 22:40 GMT	The Welsh government's tuition fee policy is threatening the future of higher education in Wales, according to the body representing its universities.
The 34-year-old Sweden striker's contract with the French champions expires in the summer, and he has been linked with Manchester United, Los Angeles Galaxy and AC Milan. "I am very proud," he said. "I came like a king, I leave like a legend but I will be back." PSG said Ibrahimovic leaves as "the greatest striker and one of the very best players in the club's history". Ibrahimovic is the club's record goalscorer despite only joining the club in 2012, his 152 goals coming in 178 appearances. PSG have won Ligue 1 in every season Ibrahimovic has been at the club, wrapping up the title this season with two months to spare. "I loved every day I spent here," said Ibrahimovic, who has won league titles with six different clubs. "Paris St-Germain has become a star club in the world and I played a key role moving it forward. It is now the right time for me to take a different path." PSG host Nantes in Ligue 1 on Saturday before meeting Marseille in the French Cup final on 21 May. An agreement is in place for Ibrahimovic to return to the club at the end of his playing career, with PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi saying he is "looking forward to the prospect of working with him again". Ibrahimovic finished as top scorer in France in 2012-13 and 2013-14, and leads Lyon's Alexandre Lacazette by 15 goals this season. He has also been included in the Ligue 1 team of the year in all of his four seasons in France.	Zlatan Ibrahimovic will leave Paris St-Germain at the end of the season.
The Reds, who had three different managers last season, used 42 different players as they avoided relegation to League One on goal difference. "We came in to 33-34 players and we are trimming. We need a tight squad," Warburton told BBC Radio Nottingham. "I want a squad of 21-22 players next year. A tighter squad is far more beneficial than a heavy squad." Forest beat Ipswich 3-0 on Sunday to ensure their Championship survival - a result which sent Blackburn down despite their 3-1 victory at Brentford. Warburton, who signed a two-and-a-half year contract when he arrived in March, used only 21 players in the last eight games of the season. "I have seen enough from my time here so far to know a good pre-season and we can put a good marker down next season," the 54-year-old added. "There is quality. Quality experienced players and quality young players, so all credit to the academy with Gary Brazil, Jack Lester and all the staff. "I have good young ones coming through I can fall back on if I have a problem."	Nottingham Forest manager Mark Warburton says he wants a much smaller squad in the Championship next season.
The Bluefin-21 submersible robot had finished its search of the area and found nothing, they said. Efforts would now focus on reviewing search data, surveying the sea floor and bringing in specialist equipment. Flight MH370 went missing on 8 March as it flew from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. Using satellite data, officials have concluded that the airliner, which had 239 people on board, ended its journey in the Indian Ocean, north-west of the Australian city of Perth. No trace of the plane has been found and there is no explanation for its disappearance. Four pings that officials believed could be from the missing plane's "black box" flight recorders were heard by search teams using a towed pinger locator device. These pings were used to define the area for the sea-floor search, conducted by the Bluefin-21. It had scoured over 850 sq km of the ocean floor, JACC said. "Yesterday afternoon, Bluefin-21 completed its last mission searching the remaining areas in the vicinity of the acoustic signals detected in early April by the towed pinger locator," a statement from the Joint Agency Co-ordination Centre (JACC) said. "The data collected on yesterday's mission has been analysed. As a result, the JACC can advise that no signs of aircraft debris have been found by the autonomous underwater vehicle since it joined the search effort. "The Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) has advised that the search in the vicinity of the acoustic detections can now be considered complete and in its professional judgement, the area can now be discounted as the final resting place of MH370." Australia's Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss said the search had been based on "the best information available at the time". The statement came hours after a US Navy official told CNN that the acoustic signals probably came from some other man-made source. The failure of the autonomous sub Bluefin-21 to find any wreckage in the ping search zone is a hammer blow to the families. It's also a sharp reminder to everyone of just how difficult this whole exercise will be. Were the pings real or were they simply spurious, a misinterpretation of sound in what is already a very noisy environment? The investigating teams will review again all their data. They will not jump to immediate conclusions. The water column can do strange things with sound, sending it in unexpected directions. The teams will be mindful also that the Bluefin-21 was at times operating beyond its qualified limits. The authorities have now recognised the need to make a proper bathymetric (depth) survey of the wider search zone - some 60,000 sq km in area. It will take at least three months, but once they know precisely the shape and depth of the sea bed they can then better choose the most appropriate vehicles to continue the underwater sweep. Wreckage could be in a ravine, covered by shifted sediment.  Without the right tools, the job of finding MH370 will be that much harder. "Our best theory at this point is that [the pings were] likely some sound produced by the ship... or within the electronics of the towed pinger locator," Michael Dean, the US Navy's deputy director of ocean engineering, told the US broadcaster. "Always your fear any time you put electronic equipment in the water is that if any water gets in and grounds or shorts something out, that you could start producing sound," Mr Dean said. A US Navy spokesmen subsequently described his comments as "speculative and premature". In its statement, JACC said an expert working group would continue to review and refine existing data to better define a search area for the missing plane. A Chinese ship had already begun mapping an area of ocean floor in a survey process that was expected to take three months. Meanwhile, the ATSB would soon seek bids from commercial contractors for the specialist equipment needed for the underwater search - a process expected to begin in August, JACC said.	The area where acoustic signals thought linked to the missing Malaysian plane were detected can now be ruled out as the final resting place of flight MH370, Australian officials say.
Under the proposals, 120,000 additional asylum seekers will be distributed among EU nations, with binding quotas. It comes after a surge of thousands of mainly Syrian migrants pushed north through Europe in recent days. Mr Juncker told the European Parliament it was "not a time to take fright". Germany, the main destination for many migrants, supports quotas, but some EU countries oppose a compulsory system. Mr Juncker's plans were set out in a "state of the union" annual address in which he outlined the priorities of the European Commission. He opened his speech by admitting the European Union was "not in a good situation. There is a lack of Europe in this union, and a lack of union in this union". He said tackling the crisis was "a matter of humanity and human dignity. It is true that Europe cannot house all the misery in the world. But we have to put it into perspective. "This still represents just 0.11% of the EU population. In Lebanon refugees represent 25% of the population." The mass migration has seen those seeking an end to persecution, conflict and hardship travel from Turkey across the sea to Greece, through Macedonia and Serbia, and then to Hungary from where they aim to reach Austria, Germany and Sweden. On Wednesday, Denmark suspended all rail links with Germany and shut a section of motorway after migrants crossed the border and began walking north, apparently trying to reach Sweden. In southern Hungary, migrants on the border with Serbia broke through police lines at the Roszke camp, forcing the closure of the M5 highway. Among Mr Juncker's proposals: "It's 160,000 refugees in total that Europeans have to take into their arms and I really hope that this time everyone will be on board - no rhetoric, action is what is needed," he told MEPs. The new plans would relocate 60% of those now in Italy, Greece and Hungary to Germany, France and Spain. The numbers allocated to each country would depend on GDP, population, unemployment rate and asylum applications already processed. Countries refusing to take in migrants could face financial penalties. 14 Sept: Special meeting of EU interior ministers on refugee crisis, with Juncker proposals on agenda 15-16 Oct: EU leaders' summit, with refugee crisis high on agenda. European Parliament then to decide on any new asylum measures with EU governments Early 2016: EU proposals for better management of legal migration to EU due What next for Germany's asylum seekers? Peston: Why Germany needs migrants more than UK What can the EU do to solve the crisis? Nine key moments in crisis The other exodus to Germany - people from the Balkans Migrant crisis in pictures Are you affected by the crisis? Spain on Wednesday said it would accept a quota of almost 15,000 extra migrants migrants set by EU. However Mr Juncker's proposals was criticised by both the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka said compulsory quotas were "not a good solution", while his Slovak counterpart called them "irrational". Poland and Romania have also opposed the idea, although Poland has agreed to take in more migrants. France welcomed the first of 1,000 migrants it has pledged to take from Germany, having committed to receive 24,000 migrants over two years. In a separate development Australia has announced plans to take in 12,000 Syrian refugees. Germany has welcomed Syrian migrants, waiving EU rules and saying it expects to deal with 800,000 asylum seekers this year alone - though not all will qualify as refugees and some will be sent back. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Wednesday that Germany needed to learn from its mistakes in labelling incomers in the post-war period as "Gastarbeiter" or "guest workers" - with the implication that they were not permanent residents. Many of the refugees it expects in future "will become new citizens of our country", she said. A note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.	European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has announced plans that he says will offer a "swift, determined and comprehensive" response to Europe's migrant crisis.
That question is even more pertinent as Labour and Plaid Cymru talk about what they can and cannot agree on. Much of the so called "economic" debate has been about its cost - whether we can afford £1bn, and whether the cheaper Blue Route would be a better option . That is a very different question from whether the Welsh economy would be stronger with it, and weaker without. There is little disagreement that the M4 between Cardiff West services and Magor, east of Newport, is regularly congested. And that slows down the A48M and the A470. There's also little disagreement that the M4 is busiest around Newport, partly because of the unusually large number of junctions which encourages local people use the motorway as a route between the various suburbs of the city. To really understand the problems we need to look at where employment in south east Wales has grown up over the last twenty years. Much of it has been developed on new sites along the motorway. It was part of the old Welsh Development Agency's policy in the late 1980s and early 90s to build big business parks, easily accessible by car. Imperial Park, Celtic Springs, Cleppa Park and Cardiff Gate are all examples of that. Many thousands of commuters travel between the Severn Bridge and at least as far west as Swansea to work for companies on those parks. These developments, and the work they offer, have also been a magnet to people living in the Gwent and Rhymney valleys who may have found it a challenge getting work closer to home. Significantly, the Welsh Government's document arguing for the Black Route clearly shows that the highest concentration of traffic is not at Brynglas but at Tredegar Park, where the main road from the Gwent valleys, the M4, the A48 and a host of industrial parks all meet. The cheaper Blue Route would take westbound traffic off the M4 east of Newport but it is hard to see how it would affect the many thousands who travel south towards the motorway. The big question in terms of easing congestion is how much the Metro integrated road-and-rail transport network will change commuters' patterns. It partly depends on whether the full Metro plans are implemented, how well and how quickly. Importantly, the proposed network does include a station at Cleppa Park - the centre of the family of business parks to the west of Newport - and other stops that may tempt people out of their cars. There is also a station planned for the Royal Gwent Hospital. If we had a public transport system that carried people from where they tend to live to where the work is - and where they want to go for shopping and hospital visits - then would we need a whole new motorway? The economic argument for the M4 Black Route centres on time and money lost due to congestion, the poor image that gives of Wales as a modern place to do businesses, and the theory that concentrations of economic activity tend to multiply more quickly than if businesses are more isolated. Wales' economic weakness centres around having too high a proportion of low-skilled low-value jobs, not enough headquarters, and not enough innovation . Perhaps the biggest question is not about the price of an upgrade of the M4, but what Wales will get from it. It's not really about £1bn or £380m - it's about what we get from that. How much would either route answer the really big challenges of the Welsh economy? Would Wales become home to more research and development, for instance, with speedier travel along the M4?  And would that be the magic factor for encouraging new or growing tech firms to be headquartered here? That's what Wales really needs.	So would the Welsh economy be weaker without the M4 Black Route - or for that matter without any M4 upgrade?
Charlene Walker, 36, suffered a single stab wound at the Darlington home of Julie Gowling in December. The 44-year-old tried to cover up the killing and dispose of the weapon, a kitchen knife, by burying it in a garden, Teesside Crown Court heard. Judge Mrs Justice Jefford told the mother-of-four she must serve a minimum of 14 years in prison. The court heard Gowling, who had denied murder, got into a heated argument with Ms Walker - a known drug user - over the missing cash on 6 December. It ended when Gowling lost her temper and stabbed Ms Walker in the chest. She then fled the house and tried to dispose of the knife. The court was told Ms Walker died as a result of massive blood loss. After the hearing, Det Supt Dave Ashton, of Durham Police, said: "Our condolences go to the family of Charlie Walker who, since her death have shown nothing but dignity and courage. "Ms Walker had a difficult life in many ways but the extreme act of violence which ended her life was not justified during an argument over a relatively trivial matter."	A woman who stabbed her lodger during a row over a missing £21 has been jailed for her murder.
Hodgson made six changes, including resting captain Wayne Rooney, from the win against Wales - but a limp performance means Chris Coleman's side finish top of Group B and England's life is now more difficult if they go deeper into Euro 2016. England had the better chances, with Slovakia keeper Matus Kozacik saving well when Jamie Vardy broke clear in the first half, as well as blocking crucially from Nathaniel Clyne after the break. Rooney came on for the struggling Jack Wilshere after 55 minutes, but the pattern was set and Slovakia defended manfully for what should prove to be a precious point. Dele Alli had also a shot kicked off the line by Martin Skrtel just seconds after coming on as a substitute on the hour. England now travel to Nice where they face the team that finishes second in Group F - either Hungary, Portugal, Iceland or Austria - next Monday. It was a major surprise that Hodgson chose to make such mass alterations to an England team that had finally picked up some momentum with Thursday's last-gasp victory over Wales. That win put them in position to top the group by beating Slovakia. Instead, with nothing decided and with the group still open, Hodgson chose to leave out Rooney, Kyle Walker, Danny Rose, Dele Alli, Raheem Sterling and Harry Kane. Hodgson introduced Vardy and Daniel Sturridge, who both scored against Wales, as well as Clyne, Ryan Bertrand, Wilshere and Jordan Henderson. It gave England a disjointed look and they ran out of steam and threat long before the end. Time will tell if this was the selection that proved decisive in England's Euro 2016 campaign - but the bottom line is when you make a controversial choice such as that, you need to win and Hodgson's side failed. Wilshere was given a starting role as Hodgson shuffled his squad to inject freshness and to give those on the margins some game time - but it was a move that failed. The 24-year-old Arsenal midfielder looked exactly what he is at the moment: less than fully fit and off the pace after a Premier League season where injuries meant he barely featured. Wilshere played just 141 minutes of Premier League football over three games at the end of Arsenal's season. This was no sort of preparation for a major tournament and it showed, but such is Hodgson's belief in his talents that he could not resist the temptation to select him, against all logic. He strived to somehow revive his best moments but it was not to be - not through any lack of effort, simply a lack of spark, his natural game dulled by the long absences. Wilshere looked a dejected figure as he went off to be replaced by Rooney after only 55 minutes, the possibility growing that his chances of making a serious impact on Euro 2016 badly damaged. The result leaves them off to the south of France and Nice, playing next Monday instead of Saturday - but they will surely regret not finishing top of Group B. This luxury now goes deservedly to Wales and while England will regard themselves as favourites to beat whoever finishes second in Group F, the price they pay could come further down the line. They now go into the half of the draw containing France, Germany and Italy - and will also have to regain the impetus they had finally built up by beating Wales but was lost in this disappointing draw. Not a good night for England. Not a good night for Roy Hodgson. England manager Roy Hodgson: "If we had won the game people would say we didn't miss them [the players who were left out] and when we don't they say the team selection is wrong, I am used to that one. "Finishing second is a disappointment but we are still in the last 16 and who is to say the team we will play will be that much stronger? "You just don't know, the way we are playing I am not frightened of anybody." Media playback is not supported on this device Slovakia coach Jan Kozak: "Our players tired as the game went on and England showed their quality and strength, but when you see an opportunity you give everything you can. "Perhaps I didn't expect to be pressed so deeply but we made some substitutions to neutralise the impact of their attack." England play their last-16 tie on Monday, 27 June at 20:00 BST, while Slovakia will have to wait to find out if they finish as one of the four best third-placed sides who progress.

Kaori Okuni, one of the women campaigning for change, said the ruling would lead to "suffering for those who plan to marry and those who are set to be born". Most women in Japan end up taking their husband's surname, a practice set to continue after Wednesday's ruling. But what do other countries do? In most well-populated countries, women are free to change their surname on marrying, if they wish. Many go further than that, putting in place laws stating that women do not have to change their names. France's law has been in place since the 18th century but, much like in Italy, there is some flexibility allowing wives to use their husband's surnames in an informal way. On all official paperwork, however, the maiden name must remain. The laws are much tougher in Greece and Quebec. In Greece, you must petition a court for a name change, and in Quebec, even if they wanted to, a wife cannot take her husband's surname at any point. In Iceland, women keep their maiden names after marriage. A surname is derived from a father's first name - so Bjork, Gudmund's daughter, becomes Bjork Gudmundsdottir - or, in certain circumstances, the mother's. A similar pattern is also followed in Ethiopia and Eritrea, where there is no concept of surnames as known in many Western countries. At birth, people are given one name, that is then followed by the father's name then the grandfather's name. Even after marrying, women retain their original three names. Could the Avatar actress Zoe Saldana and her husband Marco Perego - now Marco Saldana - be trend setters? The couple announced the move earlier this year, with Mrs Saldana calling her husband "a man who stood by change". In one case from 2012, however, a Mississippi man needed the help of the American Civil Liberties Union to take his wife's surname, having initially been prevented from changing the name on his driving licence. And in France, a change in the law now allows men to take their wife's surname - the first case was registered in Lyon in 2012, but only after seven attempts to do so were denied, despite the amendment.	Japan's Supreme Court has ruled that all married couples must have the same surname, despite concerns that the practice is discriminatory and archaic.
Sources say there has been a rise in avalanches, landslide-dammed rivers bursting, glaciers cracking and glacial lakes dangerously filling up. Studies by Chinese scientists have shown glaciers and permafrost rapidly melting in Tibet. Earthquakes also continue to destabilise them. A recent study has shown Tibet topping the list of places across the globe that has experienced an increase in water. Mining and dam construction in the Tibetan plateau have further fuelled concerns in downstream countries. In the absence of early warnings from Tibet, water-related disasters can cause human and property losses downstream in Bhutan, Nepal, India and potentially Bangladesh. One recent event took place in July when buildings in Nepalese towns bordering Tibet were swept away by a sudden flood. Authorities in Nepal say it was the result of landslides in Tibet that dammed the Bhotekoshi river. This is one of several rivers that run through Nepal which originate in Tibet. Most houses in Liping, the main town bordering Tibet, have either been swept away by floodwaters or brought down because of soil erosion caused by the floods. In Barabise and other smaller settlements, the BBC saw several houses precariously perched on the edge and all set to collapse because of the flooding. This was one of the most affected areas during last year's earthquake. "That is where my house used to stand and now all you see is a cliff overlooking the river," said Nimji Sherpa, a shopkeeper. "That night I received a call from my relative upstream that a flood was hurtling towards us. I dragged my old husband to higher land." "The next morning we came back to see that our house and all that we had was gone. Last year the earthquake destroyed my house and we had come here to start afresh and now floods have taken everything," she said, with tears in her eyes. Further up, a stretch of the Arniko highway, that links Nepal to Tibet, is gone which has disrupted traffic. "The authorities have told us to move 100 metres higher at night to sleep because we don't know what is coming our way," said Nimji Sherpa. "How long can we live like this?" Officials in Sindhupalchok district said they were able to evacuate people during the July flash flood. "We were lucky that we could save people because of our own early warning system but timely information from the Tibet side could have helped us save properties as well," said Gokarna Dawadi, chief government official in the district, who recently left this role. "We have approached the Chinese side a number of times to discuss this issue as we fear future disasters but it has not moved anywhere." In the past 80 years, scientists have recorded 10 occasions when glacial lakes burst out in Tibet and the flood waters reached Nepal. Officials in the Nepali capital Kathmandu said the Bhotekoshi disaster was an eye-opener. "So far we have no communication between China and Nepal regarding the early flood warning system," said Rishi Raj Sharma, director general of Nepal's department of hydrology and meteorology. "There has been some initial dialogue with the Chinese meteorology department but we need to raise this more seriously through our foreign ministry." Residents of the Nepali towns bordering Tibet are having sleepless nights but settlements far away from the Tibetan territory are also at risk. The Bhotekoshi river is a tributary of the Kosi which flows down from Nepal into India to meet the Ganges. Locals in Sunsari district in south-eastern Nepal, where the Kosi is at its widest and most powerful, said they have heard about floods from Tibet and were concerned. The Kosi, known as the sorrow of Bihar flooded in 2008, displacing tens of thousands of people in Nepal and India. A local water expert Dev Narayan Yadav said fears of future floods were not unfounded. "Our people here know how the bursting of glacial lakes in Tibet have flooded rivers in western Nepal and also in the Brahmaputra basin of India," Mr Yadav explained. "And because the Kosi disaster of 2008 is quite fresh in their memory, they are really wary of what might be happening upstream." The Kosi barrage was built by India to control flood water and is operated by Indian authorities. It was built in 1962 and there are concerns it is no longer fit for purpose. The Indian government is planning to build a major dam upstream in Nepal. "Big structures like these make us more scared because they will multiply the disaster and we will suffer," said Mr Yadav The Central Water Commission of India is tasked with planning and building the new dam. Officials say they have concerns about flooding from Tibet too but they're focused on the dams China is building on Tibetan rivers. "If waters from them are released in a larger quantity, they may become floods and if we have no storage in the Indian portion, that may create havoc," the commission's chairman Ghanashyam Jha told the BBC. "We have an arrangement for sharing flood information but all the desired information is not available." The water resource department of the Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh that shares a border with Tibet has stressed the proper networking of co-basins for flood warnings. "The flash flood of Pasighat during 11 May 2000 is an example in which the loss of lives and properties could have been minimised had there been proper networking and sharing of information to the downstream county," it says on its website. The Chinese authorities in Beijing did not respond to our questions. Officials in Tibet, however, said flood information was being shared with India and Bangladesh. They said they would only do the same with Nepal if they received instructions from the Chinese ministry of water resources. The United Nations wants all parties to work together. "I think there should be cross-boundary cooperation between countries in the region and unless it happens we cannot control floods," says Vijay Singh, a senior official the United Nations Development Programme Nepal office, who has worked on flood management in the country for years. "We are creating a platform so that governments of Nepal and China can come together and realise the importance of information exchange between the two but it will take some time."	India and Nepal say a lack of information from China about glacial lakes and rivers in Tibet could hamper their ability to plan for flash floods.
Devon and Cornwall Chief Constable Shaun Sawyer told PCC Tony Hogg in a 2014 letter that moving his office to the force headquarters "sends the wrong signal" financially. He added it could threaten Mr Hogg's impartiality in overseeing the police. The commissioner said he would remain impartial and the cost would be repaid in four to five years. Read more on this story as it develops throughout the day on our Local Live pages. The disagreement emerged in an exchange of letters in 2014 seen by the BBC after a freedom of information request to Devon and Cornwall Police. The force confirmed that the chief constable remains concerned about the move, the cost of which has been estimated by the crime commissioner. Mr Hogg currently rents office space at Pynes Hill Business Park in Exeter, which costs about £100,000 a year. The lease runs out this year, and the commissioner plans to move less than a mile to the Middlemoor complex, where the chief constable and senior officers are based. Almost four years on from their creation, the initial term of office of the first police and crime commissioners is almost complete. In that time, the public, and senior police officers, have become more used to the powerful officials. But, as this row demonstrates, commissioners are no less controversial. And that should make for interesting times as we approach the elections for the new commissioners, in May. A letter seen by the BBC from Mr Sawyer to Mr Hogg in May 2014 said: "I am not convinced this adds up strategically, operationally or financially. "I cannot think of a worse time for the OPCC (Office of Police and Crime Commissioner) or the Force to divert time or energy from the job in hand." He added: "I fear the public would see this as not the best use of your time or their money." The commissioner replied that the plan was part of a review of the number of buildings Devon and Cornwall Police own or lease, and designed to bring about "short, medium and long term savings". Andrew White, chief executive of the Office of the Police and Crime Commissioner, said in a statement: "The building doesn't decide if the commissioner is impartial or not. "I think it will mean an improvement for the public because we'll be spending less money on our estate... so more money will go to policing and that's the most important thing about this change." Mr Hogg is expected to decide on whether to go ahead with the move later this year. Mr Sawyer declined to comment.	A chief constable and police crime commissioner are locked in a row over a £500,000 office move.
The campaign was launched on 19 July by the Iraq War Families Campaign Group, which is made up of relatives of British troops killed in the conflict. It aimed to reach that amount to "bring to justice those responsible for the war and the deaths of our loved ones". The campaign was led by Reg Keys and Roger Bacon, who lost sons in Iraq. The funding bid began after the publication last month of the long-awaited report by Sir John Chilcot into the 2003 invasion. Chilcot report: Findings at-a-glance The campaign group initially aimed to reach £50,000 via crowdfunding, but extended its target after raising that figure in nine hours on the CrowdJustice website. It has now received enough backing to fund the whole campaign. Mr Keys and Mr Bacon said in a statement: "This is great proof of the underlying support from the British people in our quest for answers and for justice. "It is startling and humbling at the same time." The money raised will allow the group's lawyers, McCue and Partners - currently working free of charge - to analyse the 2.6 million-word report by Sir John and prepare "a comprehensive opinion approved by expert senior counsel". This would provide guidance on whether legal action against key people involved in the invasion of Iraq would succeed or not. The Chilcot report did not make any findings on whether individuals acted unlawfully. However, it rejected the legal basis for UK military action, and said then-prime minister Mr Blair overstated the threat posed by then-President of Iraq Saddam Hussein and sent ill-prepared troops into battle. Chilcot report: Coverage in full Mr Blair has apologised for any mistakes made, but not the decision to go to war itself. A total of 179 British service personnel were killed in Iraq between 2003 and 2009, when British troops left Iraqi soil. Tens of thousands of Iraqi civilians died over the period, though estimates vary considerably.	An online campaign to fund possible legal action against former Prime Minister Tony Blair and other officials has reached its target of £150,000.
Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he said he would build on the support he received at rallies to reconnect the party to voters. He rejected criticism from those who say he is mistaking the enthusiasm of his backers for wider electoral appeal. Ex-leader Neil Kinnock said Labour appeared unelectable under Mr Corbyn and faced its "greatest crisis". Labour will announce whether Mr Corbyn or Owen Smith have won the leadership contest on 24 September. Ahead of the vote, Mr Smith accused Mr Corbyn of seeking to "deepen divisions" between the party's membership - seen as overwhelmingly in favour of the leader - and its MPs - who are largely opposed to him. But asked if he would quit as leader if he thought he could not take the party to power, Mr Corbyn told Today he was "determined" to lead it into the next general election and said it could win. Referring to the "diverse" crowds of tens of thousands of people who have attended his leadership rallies in recent weeks, Mr Corbyn said they showed "there is an interest in politics... that then becomes surely a very strong campaigning base for the Labour movement". He added: "I think you'll see it begin to play out, particularly in the local elections next year and after that." In June, 20 members of the shadow cabinet resigned, and one was sacked, over differences with Mr Corbyn. Five told the BBC on Sunday they would return if asked by Mr Corbyn should he be re-elected, while nine others said they would stand if shadow cabinet elections were revived. Mr Corbyn told Today he would "reach out to" Labour MPs who have opposed his leadership "as I've reached out to them in the past". He said: "I have made it my business to talk to quite a lot of Labour MPs and will continue to do so and I hope they will understand that we've been elected as Labour MPs... "It doesn't mean everybody agrees on everything all the time - that I understand - but the general direction of opposition to austerity, opposing the Tories on grammar schools, those are actually the kind of things that unite the party." On Tuesday, Labour's national executive committee meets and will consider a plan put forward by deputy leader Tom Watson to allow the parliamentary party - its MPs and peers currently serving in Westminster - to elect the shadow cabinet, as part of efforts to reunite the party as a whole. At the moment they are appointed by the leader. Newspaper reports suggested that, under the new plan, a third of Labour's top team could be elected by the parliamentary party, another third by the party membership, and the final third chosen by the leader. Mr Corbyn has not given his support to the proposal but has indicated he would back members having a say.	Jeremy Corbyn has said he will "reach out" to Labour MPs if he is re-elected as the party's leader this week.
The public is paying tribute to Mr Ford, who died at age 46 of cancer and gained notoriety for his outlandish public acts and drug use. He was diagnosed with a rare and aggressive cancer in 2014, keeping him from running for mayor again. Before becoming mayor, he served as a city councillor, which he also served as at the time of his death. His wife, Renata, hugged supporters who lined up to pay tribute to her husband, her children Stephanie and Doug by her side. According to the CBC, hundreds of Ford fans lined up, some with newspaper clippings of happy memories of his time as mayor. Doug Holyday, his former deputy mayor, stopped before his casket, along with many city councillors. The repose continues on Tuesday and his funeral is on Wednesday. Current Toronto Mayor John Tory called him a "profoundly human guy". Former prime minister Stephen Harper, whom Ford supported in his re-election bid last year, said he was a "fighter throughout life." Profile: Former Toronto Mayor Rob Ford - Ford remained popular despite his problems with drugs and alcohol Toronto ex-mayor: Everyone makes mistakes - His "human" qualities endeared him to voters Why Rob Ford was a typical Canadian - The bawdy politician did not fit the world's often unrealistic image of Canada His image contrasted sharply with Canada's usual calm, buttoned-up politics. While serving as Toronto mayor, Mr Ford was videotaped and photographed intoxicated in public areas. "Yes, I have smoked crack cocaine," Mr Ford told reporters. "But... do I? Am I addict? No. Have I tried it? Probably in one of my drunken stupors, probably approximately about a year ago." Despite the crack-smoking scandal, his popularity remained high with fans lining up to take photo with him. He was especially popular among people living in Toronto's suburbs who felt left behind by liberal Toronto and liked his populist message.	The colourful former mayor of Toronto, Rob Ford, is lying in repose at a ceremony at Toronto City Hall.
The think tank's UK growth forecast for 2016 has been cut from 2.3% to 1.9%, and from 2.6% to just 0.4% for 2017. Meanwhile its forecast for GDP growth for 2018 was slashed from 2.4% to 1.4%. Its report said the Brexit vote would have "severe confidence effects on spending and business investment", which would lead to anaemic GDP growth over the next three years. However, the drop in the value of the pound could bolster exports by 3.4% next year, the Item Club said, with imports falling by 0.3%. Overall, the move would see net exports adding 1.1% to GDP in 2017, it added. Brexit 'will be horrible for UK economy' - fund manager Peter Spencer, chief economic advisor to the EY Item Club, said the UK economy was set to suffer a severe loss of momentum in the second half of this year. "Heightened uncertainty is likely to hold back business investment, while consumer spending will be restrained by a weaker jobs market and higher inflation," he said. "Longer-term, the UK may have to adjust to a permanent reduction in the size of the economy, compared to the trend that seemed possible prior to the vote. But amongst the gloom, the weaker pound provides one silver lining to exporters, particularly those selling to the US and emerging markets." A new survey from Deloitte found 82% of chief financial officers of both FTSE 350 and large privately owned companies expected to cut capital spending in the next year. That was the biggest proportion on record and more than double the 34% in the first quarter, Deloitte said. Its survey was conducted between 28 June 28 and 11 July, after the EU referendum and just before Theresa May became the new prime minister. Almost all the CFOs surveyed said the level of uncertainty facing their businesses was higher than normal. Ian Stewart, Deloitte's chief economist, said: "Perceptions of uncertainty have soared to levels last associated with the euro crisis five years ago." Leading City fund manager Richard Buxton, chief executive of Old Mutual Global Investors, has said the Brexit vote would have a "horrible" impact on the UK economy, which could "judder to a halt". The Item Club's Mr Spencer said that there were some positives ahead, including the UK retaining full access to the EU's single market in the short-term. As well as the fall in the exchange rate offering export opportunities, he said the predicted increases in inflation and unemployment would allow the economy to rebalance away from consumption. The Item Club also predicted that unemployment would rise from 5% to 7.1% by late 2019.	The UK economy may face "severe loss of momentum" after the vote to leave the EU, according to the EY Item Club.
Sunni Muslim Tanveer Ahmed, 32, from Bradford in Yorkshire, stabbed 40-year-old Asad Shah outside his store in Shawlands on 24 March. Ahmed had said he killed the shopkeeper because he had posted videos online in which he claimed to be a prophet. The killer was told he would serve a minimum of 27 years in prison. Mr Shah was an Ahmadi, a minority sect not recognised by all Muslims. Why was Asad Shah murdered? Last month, Ahmed had pleaded guilty to the religiously-motivated murder at a hearing at the High Court in Glasgow. Jailing him for life at the same court, judge Lady Rae told Ahmed: "This was a barbaric, premeditated and wholly unjustified killing of a much loved man who was a pillar of the local community. "He was described as a peaceful and peace-loving man and family man who went out of his way to show respect for those of any faith." The judge branded the attack as "an appalling display of merciless violence". Lady Rae added: "No-one in any civilised country including Scotland has the right to take the life of another whatever offence that individual perceives that he or she has suffered. "It is vitally important in modern society that respect and tolerance for others of any race, creed, colour, ethnic origin or religious belief is maintained and protected by the law of the land. "I note with considerable concern that you have expressed no remorse whatsoever for this appalling crime." As Ahmed was being led to the cells to begin his sentence, he shouted to his family and friends in the public gallery in what is believed to be Arabic and they chanted back at him. The court previously heard that Mr Shah was an Ahmadi who differ from the majority of Muslims, including Sunni Muslims, in that they believe the Prophet Muhammad was not the final Prophet. The majority of Muslims believe Muhammad was the final Prophet and say any other view is inconsistent with Islamic belief. Ahmed, a Sunni, claimed that he had killed Mr Shah because he had posted videos online in which the shopkeeper had "disrespected" Islam by claiming to be a prophet. Ahmed watched a clip featuring Mr Shah on his mobile phone as he travelled to Glasgow on the day of the murder and was heard in a phone message to say "listen to this guy, something needs to be done, it needs nipped in the bud". When he arrived at the shop, Ahmed said he warned Mr Shah that he was there to kill him and asked him to stop claiming to be a prophet. CCTV footage of the attack showed Ahmed pulling a knife out and moving behind the counter and stabbing Mr Shah repeatedly. The shopkeeper managed to get outside, but was stabbed again and then stamped on and kicked in a frenzied attack as he lay dying in the street. Mr Shah's brother Athar Shah tried to intervene, but was unable to fend off Ahmed. As Mr Shah lay dying on the ground, Ahmed walked calmly to a bus shelter where police found him a short time later. After being arrested, Ahmed released a statement through his lawyer saying he had killed Mr Shah as he had falsely claimed to be a prophet. After Ahmed was jailed, Ch Supt Brian McInulty, of Police Scotland, said: "I hope that the sentencing today will reassure the immediate community in Glasgow's south-side as well as communities all across Scotland that acts of violence such as this are utterly unacceptable and cannot be justified. "Glasgow is a strong, united, multi-faith community that has immense pride in its diversity. "Religious intolerance in any form is simply not tolerated in our society and Police Scotland will work in partnership with our communities to eradicate such behaviour." The Shah family moved to Scotland from Pakistan in the 1990s to escape persecution over their beliefs. No members of Mr Shah's family were in court to hear the sentence imposed, but friends were in the public gallery. A victim impact statement written by Mr Shah's sister Attia on behalf of Mr Shah's family said: "Our pain goes beyond our vocabulary. We have tried, in an inevitably inadequate way to capture the feelings and emotions that no person should ever have to do. "One of the most tangible and far-reaching consequences of this tragedy is that, as a family, whilst our bond will last forever, we have fragmented and many of us have or are in the process of leaving Scotland, in search of a new life, away from the memories we used to cherish but are now the source of immense pain and suffering." The statement said Mr Shah's widow has been "brutally deprived of a life and companionship with her soul-mate and kindred spirit, the love of her life".	A man has been jailed for life after he admitted the religiously-motivated murder of a Glasgow shopkeeper who he claimed had "disrespected" Islam.
The claim: Membership of the European Union guarantees rights on equal pay, sexual harassment and maternity leave, and rights for part-time workers. Those rights would be in jeopardy if Britain voted to leave. Reality Check Verdict: The EU has been influential in the development of equality legislation but leaving would not necessarily mean those rights would be lost. The Treaty of Rome included the commitment for member states to ensure "that men and women should receive equal pay for equal work". And the rules were strengthened following the 1975 Equal Pay Directive, and subsequent rulings by the European Court of Justice (ECJ), which have set out further what counts as equal work. Similarly, the right of part-time workers to join occupational pension schemes was determined by rulings of the ECJ, which found that excluding them constituted indirect sex discrimination. If Britain leaves the EU those rules could, in principle, be revoked. However, in some cases the UK government has gone further than the rules set by the EU. For example, the 52 weeks of statutory maternity leave in the UK is considerably longer than the 14 weeks guaranteed by EU law. Leave campaigners say there's no reason to suppose that a future British government would undermine women's rights. But Ms Harman believes that many of the people leading the campaign for Brexit - including Boris Johnson, Nigel Farage and Iain Duncan Smith - cannot be trusted to protect women's rights. She admits that this part of her argument is speculative, but she warns that women's rights could be eroded under the guise of pushing for deregulation and cutting red tape. Read more: The facts behind claims in the EU debate	Labour's former deputy leader Harriet Harman is right to say that the EU has been important in the development of UK law that affects women's right.
Sutton opened the scoring after 13 minutes when Kevin Amankwaah laid the ball back for Roarie Deacon to fire in. Nine minutes later they were two up when Maxime Biamou headed down for Jamie Collins to volley in from 10 yards. Biamou turned scorer 11 minutes later when he netted the third with a simple tap in after Cadogan had sent in a low cross to the far post. North Ferriby pulled a goal back three minutes into the second half when Robbie Tinkler ran into the area, evading four defenders, before shooting into the far corner. But any thoughts of a fightback were ended when Cadogan netted just after the hour, shooting through the goalkeeper's legs, before getting his side's fifth goal with seven minutes to go.

However the Spanish champions insisted they had not committed any offence. "The aim is to cover eventual interpretations that could be given to the contracts drawn up in the operation to sign Neymar," a club statement read. Barca paid £48.6m for Santos striker Neymar, 22, in the summer with his parents receiving £34m of the fee. Between the initial fee paid in the summer, signing-on fee, wages during his five-year deal, agents fees and this latest tax payment, Neymar will have cost the club £106.8m Last month, Sandro Rosell resigned as Barcelona president following accusations he misappropriated money. He is also being investigated but denies any wrongdoing. At the time of the move, Barcelona said they had paid 57m euros (£48.6m) for Neymar but it has been alleged that, if other contracts are taken into account, the actual cost of the player was far greater. And last week a judge in Spain ruled there was sufficient evidence against Barcelona to continue investigations into the transfer. The club added: "The board denies the existence of any tax-related crime in relation to the fiscal obligations arising from the signing of the player. "Given the existence of a possible divergent interpretation of the exact amount of tax responsibility arising from the signing and to defend the club's reputation and good name, FC Barcelona has this morning made a complimentary tax declaration of a total of 13,550,830.56 euros [...] although we remain convinced that the original tax payment was in line with our fiscal obligations." There has not yet been any confirmation whether the case will be dropped after Barcelona's payment. Neymar has scored seven goals in 18 league appearances for Barcelona this season, as well as netting three in seven Champions League matches.	Barcelona have paid £11.2m (13.5m euros) to the Spanish authorities after being charged with tax fraud over the signing of Neymar.
A spokesman said the new estimate was based on a review of intelligence reports from May to August. IS has seized vast swathes of Iraq and beheaded several hostages in recent months, leading to US airstrikes. US Secretary of State John Kerry is visiting Turkey, seeking more support for action against IS. US officials say retired Gen John Allen will be tasked with forming an international coalition to fight IS. On Thursday, 10 Arab countries agreed to help the US attack the group in both Iraq and Syria. The CIA had previously believed that IS had about 10,000 fighters, spokesman Ryan Trapani said. "This new total reflects an increase in members because of stronger recruitment since June following battlefield successes and the declaration of a caliphate, greater battlefield activity, and additional intelligence," he added. The revision comes a day after President Obama outlined a plan to "degrade and destroy" IS and to increase military support for allied forces engaged in fighting the group. For the first time, he authorised air strikes against the group in Syria. In recent months IS has expanded from its stronghold in eastern Syria and seized control of more towns, cities, army bases and weaponry in Iraq. The US has already carried out more than 150 air strikes against IS in Iraq. It has also sent hundreds of military advisers to assist Iraqi government and Kurdish forces, but has ruled out sending ground troops. Other countries, including the UK, have contributed humanitarian assistance to Iraqis displaced by the group's advance. Mr John Kerry secured the co-operation of several Arab countries during a meeting in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia on Thursday. Nato member Turkey, however, refused to sign a communique calling for countries to join the US in the fight against IS. Analysts say this may be because the group currently holds 49 Turkish citizens, including diplomats. Mr Kerry downplayed the move, saying the important US ally was dealing with some "sensitive issues". He is due to travel to Turkey on Friday to try to secure more co-operation from the government.	The CIA says the Islamic State (IS) militant group may have up to 31,000 fighters in Iraq and Syria - three times as many as previously feared.
Charlie Dunn, from Tamworth, died in hospital after being found submerged in the Blue Lagoon area at Bosworth Water Park in Leicestershire on 23 July. Lynsey Dunn, 28, and Paul Smith, 36, who are believed to be the boy's mother and stepfather, have been charged with manslaughter by gross negligence. They are also accused of seven child neglect offences. These offences are alleged to have taken place between April 2012 and July 2016. Live updates from the East Midlands In addition, Mr Smith has been charged with two counts of witness intimidation alleged to have taken place in March 2016 and June 2017; one count of threats to damage or destroy property by fire in June 2017; and eight driving offences which are alleged to have taken place in January and June 2017. Both defendants, of Caledonian, Glascote Heath, Tamworth, appeared at Leicester Magistrates' Court earlier and are due to appear at Leicester Crown Court on 5 July.	A man and woman have been charged with the manslaughter of a five-year-old boy who drowned in a lake.
The team-mates collided while racing for the lead on the last lap of the Austrian Grand Prix on Sunday. Hamilton went on to win and now trails Rosberg, who was fourth, by 11 points. Triple world champion Hamilton said: "I've been in that position before. It goes against all racing values." The two drivers will resume their contest at this weekend's British Grand Prix, where a crowd of 140,000 is expected on race day at Silverstone. But Mercedes F1 boss Toto Wolff has indicated he could impose restrictions to prevent them from racing freely, reducing the likelihood of another crash. "I didn't come into this sport to be in that situation, so I will pray and hope that's not the case," said Hamilton, 31. "Firstly for myself, because that would take the joy of racing out. Secondly for the fans, because that will rob them of what they pay so much money for. "They save up all year to go to the British Grand Prix. Team orders are not something that should deprive them of their excitement. "Even if it's the other way around and the guy's coming for me, that's racing. That is what you sit in the dirt and mud in the camper van at Silverstone for and that is why you buy the cap, because you have that passion and that fire." Rosberg was held responsible for the incident by race stewards, who penalised him 10 seconds and added two penalty points on his licence. Wolff, who operates the team on the basis that the two drivers race freely but must not crash into each other, called the collision "brainless" and said he would consider "all options" to try to control the situation. Responding to Wolff's comments. Hamilton said: "Emotions are running high but it might not have been the best thing to say. "There's more than just me, Nico and Toto. There are 1,300 people on the team that are watching us. Even through this difficult time, it's important how we project that energy as leaders." Wolff will discuss the situation with senior Mercedes management before deciding what policy to introduce. But Hamilton insisted: "I feel like I have the right to say my opinion regardless of the boss. I don't feel anyone is above or below, regardless of how you live, wealth, religion, whatever it might be. "You can talk to anyone on that level with respect so I would tell them I have an opinion that needs discussion. They hire me as a racing driver to race. They don't hire us to finish as a number two."	Lewis Hamilton says he will "pray and hope" Mercedes do not introduce team orders in his Formula 1 title battle with Nico Rosberg because it "robs" fans and "takes the joy" out of racing.
The City Council wants to add an extra 700 spaces to the east of the Seacourt site, which currently has 794 spaces in an attempt to ease congestion. Proposals include a new waiting area building and increased cycle parking. The council said it considered relocating to a lower flood-risk zone but had not been able to find a suitable alternative. A spokesman said: "The proposals respond to the rapid growth that is anticipated in the city centre, particularly the west end regeneration area." The site, which serves users entering from the west of the city, has been operating for more than 30 years. Subject to planning consent, work could start in Spring 2016 with the complex anticipated to be open in the Summer of 2017. A public exhibition is being held at the Assembly Room at Oxford's Town Hall. There will be a further session on 19 September at the West Oxford Community Centre.	Plans to expand one of Oxford's Park and Rides into the Green Belt have been unveiled.

Solly Msimanga, from the opposition Democratic Alliance (DA), said the vehicles would instead be given to a police anti-hijack unit. However, he will continue to use the luxury car used by the previous mayor. The DA took control of Tshwane, a metropolitan area including the capital Pretoria, from the African National Congress (ANC) in local elections. Mr Msimanga said no more luxury cars would be bought under his leadership. He took over from the governing ANC, which lost control of  the capital for the first time since 1994, last month. More on this and other African stories Four things from South Africa election The ANC bought 10 new BMW 3 series vehicles, which are yet to be delivered, for 5 million rand ($356,000; £266,000), local reports say. The cars were meant for members of the mayoral council, with the ANC said to be confident it would retain control of the municipality in the elections. He will still use a BMW 5 series car he inherited from the previous mayor, reports the IOL website. Mr Msimanga's spokesman Matthew Gerstner told the BBC that this vehicle could not "be dispensed with because it's been bought and paid for already and treasury regulations prohibit that". He added: "But, as soon as he can replace it, he will, with a sensible, low-cost vehicle". Mr Msimango says the DA-led coalition government wanted to embark on cost-cutting measures. He said in a statement: "No new luxury cars will be bought or leased for politicians‚ and if vehicles currently owned by Tshwane require replacement‚ sensible and low-cost vehicles will be procured. "I will not allow public money to be spent on luxury cars‚ while our people struggle for services‚ houses and jobs. "A Hyundai i20 or Toyota Corolla can do the same job for a politician as an expensive sedan." The ANC national government has been criticised for wasteful expenditure, so South Africans will be closely watching what the opposition do differently in the key urban areas they won in the August elections, says the BBC's Pumza Fihlani in Johannesburg. South Africans will be keen to see if the opposition, which has until now only run one province, will be able to make good on its ambitious election promises, our correspondent says.	A new mayor in South Africa says he will give away a fleet of new luxury cars ordered by his predecessors.
The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) had ordered all insurance companies to split out the extra charges for the additional protection. But the Co-op was the only firm which missed a deadline to do so, in August last year. As a result around 120,000 customers received quotations that were unclear. From 1 February, the Co-op will provide two separate quotations - one with no claims bonus protection, and one without. "It is very disappointing that a major company such as Co-op Insurance has taken so long to provide this vital information to its customers," said Adam Land, senior director of remedies, business and financial analysis at the CMA. "Before the order came into force, the price and benefits of NCB [no claims bonus] protection were often unclear to drivers. "We expect the Co-op to fully comply with the terms of our directions immediately, so that motorists can search more easily for the best deal for them, and decide whether or not they want this optional cover." The Co-op said most of its quotations do now provide separate details of no claims bonus charges. "For 90% of our new business customers we are already fully compliant with this order," a spokesperson said. "We are part way through a major transformation programme, which when complete will allow us to be fully compliant and enable us to provide best in class service to our members."	The Co-op has been ordered to provide clearer insurance quotations, after it failed to tell motorists about separate charges for no claims bonuses.
Sergei Lavrov said the US had broken its promise to separate the powerful Jabhat Fateh al-Sham (formerly known as al-Nusra Front) and other extremist groups from more moderate rebels. And he defended the bombardment of Aleppo by Russian and Syrian forces. Jabhat Fateh al-Sham is linked to al-Qaeda. Mr Lavrov was speaking to Stephen Sackur on BBC World News TV on the first anniversary of the beginning of the Russian air campaign in Syria. "They [the US] pledged solemnly to take as a priority an obligation to separate the opposition from Nusra," he said. "They still, in spite of many repeated promises and commitments... are not able or not willing to do this and we have more and more reasons to believe that from the very beginning the plan was to spare Nusra and to keep it just in case for Plan B or stage two when it would be time to change the regime." Watch the BBC interview in full. Mr Lavrov says that it is US policy towards Syria that is floundering, insisting that  American officials have lost control of both events and of themselves. There is an element of truth here - at least in policy terms. The US has no real alternative to Secretary of State John Kerry's efforts to deal with the Russians. There is no credible "plan B". Mr Lavrov's central message - that Washington has refused to press its allies to separate themselves from the Islamists of al-Nusra ignores the fact that it is Russia's air campaign that is pushing rebel groups into al-Nusra's arms. Mr Lavrov's contention that the US is preserving al-Nusra,  hoping eventually to use it to change the regime, will prompt  gasps of condemnation in Washington. But Mr Lavrov implicitly highlights a perennial difficulty for Washington - its search  for a moderate opposition of sufficient critical mass to influence the battlefield. Who are Jabhat Fateh al-Sham? How Moscowâ€™s Syria campaign has paid off Aleppo remains thorn in government's side Why truce was doomed to fail A recent US-Russian deal was meant to lead to joint Russian-US air strikes on the Islamic State group and Jabhat Fateh al-Sham. But many of the more moderate rebel groups that the US backs have formed a strategic alliance with the more powerful Jabhat Fateh al-Sham and now fight alongside it. Mr Lavrov said: "We believe that the Russian-American deal must be put into effect. For this the only thing which is necessary is to separate the opposition from Nusra. If it is supported by the United States, not on paper but in real life, and then we will insist on an immediate cessation of hostilities." The United Nations says 400 civilians, including many children, have been killed in the besieged city of Aleppo during the past week as a result of bombardment by Russian and Syrian government forces. Mr Lavrov insisted Russia was helping President Assad's forces to "fight terrorists". And he accused the West of staying quiet about civilian suffering in Aleppo when it was expecting the city to fall to the rebels after the Nusra group moved in and cut supply lines to the civilian population. "We had many pauses, many humanitarian pauses during this year... 48 hours, 72 hours at the request of the United Nations. "Every time these pauses have been used by Nusra to get from abroad more fighters, more ammunition and more weapons. There must be some first step and we have to get our priorities right. "Humanitarian things are very important and we are doing everything now together with the Syrian government to help the United Nations to get weekly pauses in Aleppo to deliver humanitarian goods. It's the Nusra-controlled people in eastern Aleppo who refuse to do this." Pressed on the civilian casualties in Aleppo allegedly caused by Russian bunker-busting bombs, phosphorus munitions and cluster bombs, he replied: "If this happens, then we are very sorry." But he insisted there had been no "meaningful proof" of this and there was a need to investigate every case. "We are not using any munition which is prohibited by the United Nations," he added. Friday saw Syrian government forces and rebels fighting in the centre of Aleppo and north of the city, a week into the Russian-backed offensive by the Syrian army to take the city and surrounding area. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group and a Syrian military official said government forces had captured territory north of Aleppo and buildings in the city centre, but rebel sources denied this.	The US is trying to spare a jihadist group in its attempts to unseat Syria's President Bashar al-Assad, Russia's foreign minister has told the BBC.
The force said paedophile hunter activities can hinder investigations and lead to offenders walking free. Det Ch Supt Tom Richards of Kent Police said it also diverts resources away from cases involving real children. Kent group The Hunted One said: "Police should concern themselves more with tackling paedophiles than us." But Mr Richards said: "There have been zero cases in Kent where a vigilante paedophile hunter group has identified an individual who has at that stage presented a real risk to a real child. "In the last two financial years, vigilante groups in Kent have contributed to 20 individuals being arrested but my resources alone in the same period have arrested 299 people." Professor Martin Gill, a criminologist working for Perpetuity Research, said: "There is nothing worse than a police investigation to get to its crescendo and then be undermined by an often well-intentioned but disastrous intervention." The Hunted One claims to have caught 57 people, leading to 27 convictions. In October last year, Mark McKenna from Northfleet was jailed for five years after he was snared by The Hunted One. The 38 year-old thought he was meeting an 11-year-old girl for sex at Bluewater Shopping Centre in Kent. But instead of talking to a vulnerable child online, he was speaking to the group of concerned parents. Ben Bleach of The Hunted One said he could not understand why "a child has to be raped" before action is taken.	Vigilante groups seeking to expose paedophiles should stop taking the law into their own hands, Kent Police has said.
Johnson made his film debut in the 1950s and featured in numerous films, alongside stars such as Frank Sinatra, Laurence Olivier and Charlton Heston. A founder member of the Royal Shakespeare Company, Johnson played several lead roles including Romeo and Mark Anthony in Julius Caesar. He also appeared in several TV dramas such as Lewis and Silent Witness. Johnson died after a short illness at the Royal Marsden Hospital in Chelsea, London. He is survived by his wife Lynne, who he married in 2004, and his four children. Johnson was born in Upminster, Essex, and he left his training at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) to join Sir John Gielgud's company. He joined the Royal Navy during World War Two and then made his film debut in 1959, when he appeared in the MGM film Never So Few, starring Frank Sinatra and Gina Lollobrigida. He also appeared in The Haunting (1963) and Khartoum (1966), opposite Laurence Olivier and Charlton Heston. His family said he was offered and turned down the role of James Bond after playing British spy Bulldog Drummond in Deadlier Than the Male (1967) and its sequel Some Girls Do (1969). His most recent film credits include The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas (2008) and Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001).	British actor Richard Johnson, whose career spanned film, theatre and TV, has died aged 87, his family has said.
Their last home game, a 4-0 win over Droylsden, attracted 142 supporters and after staff and players were paid, the Tigers were left with £21 profit. Last week, the club issued an appeal for £25,000 so they could "stay in a solvent position" until the summer. "There are fans out there but if they don't come back then we're not going to have a team," said Hughes. The club's owner, Eamonn McGurk, has supported the club financially since they struggled to pay a tax bill of more than £80,000 in the 1990s. It is estimated his investment runs to more than £1m, in addition to funding the planning costs for a new ground. The Blue Square Bet North club have been without a home for six years after their Meadow Park ground was destroyed by flooding and their nomadic status has played a major part in their financial difficulties. They have shared with local clubs Forest Green Rovers, Cirencester and most recently Cheltenham Town - where they have been based since 2010. But Hughes believes their move out of the city, and the historical rivalry the Tigers have with Cheltenham, has caused fans to abandon their local club. "If I had £10 for every time I've spoken to someone who has said 'I used to support Gloucester but I'm not going to come back until you've returned to Gloucester', I'd probably be able to sustain the club," he told BBC Gloucestershire. "There's always been this rivalry across the divide but Cheltenham are a Football League club now and that's what we've always wanted to aspire to. "We've been fortunate that Cheltenham allowed us to have a ground share - they could have said no." Gloucester pay £40,000 a year to play at Whaddon Road, but were recently threatened with eviction after failing to meet payments. The issue is close to being resolved and Gloucester hope to have a deal in place next week to remain in Cheltenham for next season's campaign. Plans for a new stadium at the Meadow Park site were submitted to Gloucester City Council in 2011, but have yet to be approved. "It has left me so frustrated," Hughes added. "There's been a lot of money spent on reports etc [for new stadium] and it's been draining. "It's been difficult. We're tired and we just need something we can hang our hat on. We need something that will attract investors and keep us going."	Gloucester City chairman Nigel Hughes has urged absent fans to return to the struggling non-league club.
Barry Pring, 47, was killed by a speeding car as he tried to hail a taxi on the hard shoulder of a dual carriageway in Kiev in 2008. His wife, Ganna Ziuzina, had returned to a restaurant for a missing glove. The coroner at Exeter County Hall, Dr Elizabeth Earland, recorded a verdict of unlawful killing. More on the millionaire 'murdered' by his wife, and other news She said: "His guard was lowered by inebriation. The car had stolen licence plates and did not brake or stop. "I am satisfied that having heard all the evidence... much of it circumstantial, nevertheless, in my view it is overwhelming. "I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Barry John Pring has been unlawfully killed." She said the case demonstrated the difficulty in investigating a case of a death abroad, adding: "Our thoughts and condolences must go to the family who have endured years and years of distress and unhappiness." Close friend Peter Clifford, a lawyer, told the inquest he had "no reasonable doubt" that Barry was murdered. Ms Ziuzina, known as Anna, was 19 years younger than her husband. She tried to claim his assets within days of his death. His family believe he was killed in a staged hit and run accident. The couple met online in 2006 and were married in 2007 following a four-day engagement. Mr Pring's mother, Irene Pring, said Ms Ziuzina claimed to be a teacher when the pair first met, but she was in fact a lap dancer and stripper. She said: "We are sure Anna had some involvement in his death to inherit his money and property. "I was quite surprised how cold she was with Barry. She did not lift a finger, she was a lazy thing." The inquest heard Ms Ziuzina sold her husband's Range Rover, contents from his flat and moved funds from his bank account. The hearing was also told she was "entitled to the first Â£200,000 of his estate" and that computer records revealed "she was having an affair with a Ukrainian man". Greater Devon coroner Dr Elizabeth Earland said "strenuous attempts" had been made to get her to attend the inquest, but without success. In a statement, Ms Ziuzina said she had made "three separate statements to Ukrainian police" and did not believe she could "add anything further". Det Con Jonathan Watts, from Devon and Cornwall Police, said Mr Pring was hit by a car with no lights, speeding at 75mph. He also said witnesses at the scene in Kiev described the killing "as a deliberate act". The Ukrainian police closed an inquiry into his death, but relaunched it in 2011 as a murder inquiry. The case is still active "but not actively pursued".	The family of a millionaire businessman "are sure" he was killed for his money by his Ukrainian wife, an inquest has heard.
Its parliament approved the sending of a formal invitation, which he has to accept before ascending to the throne. The deeply revered King Bhumibol Adulyadej died on 13 October, plunging Thailand into mourning. The prince was widely expected to succeed his father, but officials had earlier said he wanted to postpone it by at least a year. The official reason given was that he wanted to give the Thai people time to mourn his father before he became king. Correspondents say Thailand was left in an odd constitutional limbo as the prince, the undisputed heir, should have succeeded his father immediately. In the past doubts have been expressed by senior officials over how the crown prince can perform the role played by his father for 70 years. The monarchy occupies a pivotal place in Thailand's political order. King Bhumibol Adulyadej had been seen as a unifying figure amid periods of political unrest, including during the most recent military coup in 2014. The leader of Thailand's parliament, the National Legislative Assembly, is expected to meet the crown prince in the next few days to formally invite him. Once the crown prince accepts, his succession would then be announced to the public. But it is still not clear when that will happen. Former Prime Minister Prem Tinsulanonda is currently standing in as regent. Thailand has rarely had what might be called routine royal successions. The last was 70 years ago, when the young King Ananda was found shot dead in his bedroom in still unexplained circumstances. When he died, an emergency session of parliament that night named his grief-stricken brother Bhumibol king. Despite private speculation over the prospects of his popular sister Princess Sirindhorn, Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn has been the undisputed heir to the throne since his formal investiture in 1972. Thai succession law follows the principle of primogeniture, where the throne should pass to the eldest son of the reigning king, but it also gives the king the discretion to name his own choice. King Bhumibol never wavered in his endorsement of the crown prince. But the crown prince's unexpected decision to delay taking the throne has made this yet another succession which has departed from the script. His real reasons are not known; public mourning for his father would not have been affected had he been anointed immediately after his father's death.	Thailand has begun the process of naming Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn as the country's new king.
Watkins has been banned for four years after he tested positive for the anabolic steroid nandrolone and the stimulant methylhexaneamine. He joins team-mate Shaun Cleary, who has been banned for two years as benzoylecgonine, a cocaine metabolite, was found in his system. Both players tested positive before a friendly against Bridgend Ravens RFC. UKAD Director of Legal, Graham Arthur said: "Ryan Watkins deliberately ingested nandrolone and methylhexaneamine without any consideration for his responsibilities as an athlete. "By making this conscious choice to dope, Watkins has chosen to cheat his team-mates, the opposition and his sport. "I hope this case will act as strong deterrent to other young amateur players - the risks to your playing career, your reputation and more importantly to your health, just aren't worth it." Speaking about Cleary, Mr Arthur said:  "Although Mr Cleary used cocaine three days before playing, cocaine was still in his system when he played. "Cocaine is banned from sport and athletes are solely responsible for what is in their system, regardless of whether there is an intention to cheat or not." Welsh Rugby Union chief executive Martyn Phillips said about Cleary: "This case serves as a strong warning to everyone in the game that non-compliance with anti-doping rules carries grave consequences. "Whether intentional, or inadvertent, players have a responsibility to themselves, to each other, to their clubs and to the sport to act within the rules and spirit of the game. "We work closely with UK Anti-Doping and fully adhere to the World Anti-Doping Code. There is no room in the code for carelessness or not knowing. "We will be relentless in working with UKAD to follow up leads that out players who dope in Welsh rugby." Maesteg Harlequins are mid-table in Welsh National League Division One West Central and Cleary has been banned until 10 October, 2017. Watkins is banned until 11 September 2019.	Maesteg Harlequins lock Ryan Watkins has become the 12th Welsh rugby player to be suspended by UK Anti-Doping.
Cuadrilla's plans for fracking at its Preston New Road site at Little Plumpton were approved in October. The firm says it will put Lancashire first for creating jobs, new skills, investment, and community initiatives. Opponents said they were surprised by the news since a legal challenge to the government's decision is outstanding. Preston New Road Action Group issued formal legal proceedings at the High Court in November. Cuadrilla said an "independently audited tracker" will monitor its pledges to Lancashire. Chief executive Francis Egan said the shale gas industry would be good for the county's economy. "We expect that in the exploration phase alone we will spend in the order of Â£50m - clearly all of that will not go to Lancashire... but we would hope that up to half of that money could get spent in Lancashire," he said. The firm also said Bolton-based civil engineering firm AE Yates Ltd has been awarded the site's Â£1.5m building contract. Work is expected to start early next year, Cuadrilla said.	The company behind the UK's first horizontal fracking operation has announced six "commitments" which it claims will ensure Lancashire benefits.
Regina Edwards, 52, strangled Priscilla Edwards, 78, with a scarf in February, the Old Bailey heard. Edwards, who lived in Plumstead, south London, had a history of mental health problems. In 1995 she was convicted of stabbing one of her daughters in the leg. She has been sentenced to life with a minimum of 10 years. During a phone call to a family member soon after her mother's body was found at her house in Kirkham Street, Plumstead, Edwards said: "I did it, it was me." Priscilla, a former midwife, was suffering from dementia at the time of her death. After her 1995 conviction, Edwards - who has a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder - spent ten years in a psychiatric unit under the care of Oxleas Mental Health Trust. She was discharged in 2006. Judge John Bevan, who said there was a "serious risk" she would attack someone again, ordered Edwards be returned to a secure hospital. If she is deemed suitable for release from psychiatric care within 10 years, she will be kept in jail until eligible for parole. In statements, Edwards's family said they felt "hurt and extremely angry" and pleaded for her to stay locked up. They expressed anger at the acceptance of her plea of diminished responsibility, but felt it was inevitable. Judge Bevan said: "The daughters argue the defendant should be in secure accommodation indefinitely and express considerable concern about the Bracton Centre, where she is at the moment, because they live in the area and in the past she absconded and visited the home. "There is real fear for their security when she is not taking her medication."	A woman who strangled her mother because she thought she was a "witch" has pleaded guilty to manslaughter.
The incident happened as the 33-year-old walked under a railway bridge on Dumbarton Road, near the junction with Cable Depot Road, at about 22:00 on Saturday 10 September. Both boys were described as being white, aged about 14 or 15 and wearing dark-coloured sportswear. One of them had brown hair in a quiff. The woman was taken to the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital for treatment and later reported the incident to police. Det Sgt Kevin Mulvenna, of Police Scotland, said: "This was a completely unprovoked and senseless attack on this woman, which has left her blind in one eye. The youths responsible must be caught as soon as possible. "To point a laser pen at someone is highly irresponsible. Extensive inquiries are ongoing to trace the two boys, with officers carrying out inquiries in the local area and studying CCTV footage to identify them." He asked anyone with information to contact police.	Police are searching for two teenage boys after one of them shone a laser into a woman's eye in Clydebank, leaving her blind in one eye.
Special Report: The Technology of Business The workplaces that build Africa's future Is teleworking driving us crazy? The tech getting disabled people into work Recruitment robots need impressing Is technology killing the lure of company heritage? If you're not at work catching up when you think the boss isn't looking, you're quite likely to be on the sofa in front of the television. If so then you're not alone. According to research by Nielsen 88% of US tablet owners use them while watching TV at least once a month, with 45% using them several times a day. In the UK, that figure is 80%, with 24% using it daily. These countries may be at the top of the list - but the figures point to a growing trend. Rather than resign themselves to audiences watching with half an eye, while posting pictures of kittens on Facebook, broadcasters are looking for ways to harness this trend to keep viewers engaged. No verifiable eyeballs on your content leads to dwindling advertising income. At IBC, the annual gathering of the broadcast industry in Amsterdam, the rise of the second screen, or companion device (that's a tablet or smartphone to you and me) was the topic of the moment. If the idea of a coming zombie apocalypse keeps you up at night, you may have found yourself watching The Walking Dead for tips. So many of us tuned in that its broadcaster, FX UK, decided to create a companion app for series two that would appeal to viewers, but that would keep those precious eyeballs glued to the screen during the important bits. "It was fascinating to tie [the app] with the idea of gamification with that particular programme, with that fanbase, which seemed to make sense," says Steve Plunkett, chief technology officer at broadcast technology and service provider Red Bee. "But we had no idea how it was going to play out with the public. So we were delighted to see the take-up rates which were great." As well as being popular with audiences, it has also won an IBC innovation award. A bit like Cluedo for the undead, the app lets you predict how many zombies will bite the dust during each episode, who will despatch them, and the most common weapon of choice. As each member of the undead hordes meets their maker, the app notes the kill, who was responsible and how they did it. At the end of the episode viewers discover how close they got, and can then share the results on Facebook and Twitter. "What's interesting is that we can now accurately tie together the two screens," says Mr Plunkett. "We knew exactly what episode you were watching, you just switched on and it figured everything out, and knew exactly where you were in the programme." It uses technology known as audio watermarking, which lets the app work whether you watch live, time-shifted or recorded on your DVR. Tiny chunks of data that are inaudible to humans are embedded in the soundtrack of the show. The device running the app then "listens" as the episode starts, works out which one you are watching and synchronises with it. For content where it's not possible or practical to embed data, audio fingerprinting can be used, where specific audio triggers the synchronisation of an app. For devices that don't have microphones, signals sent via the internet can also be used. Another show with a cult following that has its own companion app is US biker gang saga Sons of Anarchy. The app has evolved over two seasons, according to Magic Ruby's Robert Gekchyan. "[In our proof of concept app] you see a character you like, you want his hat, you want his jacket. They had all the items already on the website, but by presenting it on this app they really saw a huge uptake of sales. "This year we have a full application that has trivia that gets people really engaged in the show, exclusive on-set photos and some of the writers on the show have contributed to the content in the application." The app also synchronises with each episode, letting viewers track the conversation about episodes on social media - regardless of when they're watching. "We built something called the social timeline so you can actually follow the show through tweets that are happening as things happen specifically in the show. "This really works well in times-shifted environments - different time zones, catch-up TV situations where you still want to follow along the conversation." The next step for Magic Ruby is looking at new ways of making money from these apps. "It would probably be difficult to do the traditional or banner advertising in this space," he says. "So it's how do we get advertisers to do interactive advertising, get involved in the show, it's not just your watching the show and this car commercial that has zero context comes up." John Stoneman of mobile advertising specialists InMobi agrees. "For it to be effective, it needs to be complementary to the user's experience and not obtrusive... and that's one of the great things about the second screen. The consumer has the option to engage if they want to, but it's not forcing them to sit through something they don't want." Mr Stoneman believes broadcasters need to come to terms with second screen devices, and how they're being used. The chief executive of online video platform Brightcove, Jeremy Allaire, believes there's a more radical shift taking place. The company recently launched their app creation platform AppCloud, aimed at letting broadcasters and other content creators build companion apps. "In my mind I think that the current effort is sort of a band-aid or a hack, and the real opportunity is when the full content experience and the applications that interact with that content are all delivered over the internet to tablets or smart TVs." he says. The company is also creating full screen TV apps aimed at content far beyond regular programming. "Dual screen TV apps are about really using the TV set as the second screen. "The tablet becomes the primary screen you interact with, you make choices on, and discover on and the large display is where you have rich media and consume content and information." Perhaps unsurprisingly he has strong views on the future of television. "Linear television is not going to be saved by companion second-screen applications, that's for sure. I think you know more likely 90% of the content that's on linear television should really just be content that's published on demand." Not everyone agrees. Magic Ruby's Robert Gekchyan sees things differently. "I think people still love TV, they love the content, and now they can have the interactivity and the interactivity with their friends. "You're by yourself on the couch and you're watching with multiple people. It's perfect for live events, for sports, for reality shows, water-cooler-type TV shows." No knows what lies ahead - but maybe there's room for something in between. One of the most popular demonstrations at IBC is broadcast software experts NDS' video wall. In their conception of the future the walls of our home become a giant television screen, that integrates with the wallpaper. Content selection is done from a tablet device, and is "thrown" to the wall you want to view it on. This can be anything from movies, television, radio, social media and news to the family calendar, the view from your nannycam, or family photos and videos. It can be any size you want, with as much or as little content on display. Audio is directional, and advertising and other broadcast furniture can be arranged around the picture, leaving the image clean. At the moment screen technology means the bevels are clearly visible between panels. But it doesn't take much imagination to picture technology like Sony's new 4k ultra-high definition television, also on show at the exhibition, or NHK's 8k super hi vision, or even Dolby's glasses-free 3D making the experience even more immersive. Whatever the future holds, one thing is clear. As a species we are likely to become ever more addicted to vast amounts of content - wherever it comes from. As long as the zombies don't get us first...	Where are you reading this?
Jennings, 25, was out for 48 on the fourth morning of the third Test against the Proteas, meaning he averages only 15.3 in six innings. "Even though he got 48, there were a lot of edges," said Smith. "If I was a selector I'd be thinking it was time to make a change with the West Indies and then the Ashes coming up." England play one more Test against South Africa, followed by three against the West Indies before they defend the Ashes down under. Johannesburg-born Jennings was 34 not out overnight at The Oval, having survived a dropped catch and successfully overturned an lbw decision on the third day. He added 14 to his score before fending a short delivery from Kagiso Rabada to gully. Speaking on Test Match Special, Smith - who led South Africa to two Test series wins in Australia - added: "Should England give another player time to settle in? "The way that Jennings plays, I think Australia might be quite a scary place for him. "It's not easy. These are people's lives and they're working hard, but I think South Africa would love Jennings to play in the final Test match. "If you had to ask them they would say: 'Please pick him.'" Jennings' struggles are the latest in an ongoing problem for England, who have tried 11 different opening partners for Alastair Cook since Andrew Strauss retired in 2012. Some have had success - Adam Lyth and Sam Robson made centuries, while Haseeb Hameed impressed in India before suffering an injury and struggling for form with county side Lancashire. Durham left-hander Jennings, who replaced Hameed in India, also made a century on his Test debut, but has since passed 50 only once in nine innings. If he is removed from the England side, his most likely replacement would be Surrey's Mark Stoneman, who is the third highest run-scorer in County Championship Division One this season. "I can't say if Stoneman is better, I haven't seen enough - but if they think there is potential then I would give him a go," said Smith.	An Ashes series in Australia will be a "scary" proposition for England opener Keaton Jennings, says former South Africa captain Graeme Smith.
Abdulmalik Adua, 17, of Woolwich and Rezwan Islam, 19, of Gloucester, were both sentenced to a minimum of 16 years in prison. Paul Pass, 49, was stabbed in his flat in Gloucester last October by the pair, who used it as a drug-dealing base. Adua and Islam were found guilty of murder at an earlier hearing. Islam was also found guilty of kidnap. Bristol Crown Court heard Mr Pass was hit over the head with a guitar and stabbed in the leg, which caused his death. Bilal Ebrahim Moosajee, 19, of Gloucester was jailed for nine years after admitting manslaughter and kidnap at an earlier hearing. He will serve half his sentence before being considered for release on parole. The court was told the men were all part of a drug-dealing gang from outside the county who were trying to establish themselves in the city. They offered Mr Pass free drugs in exchange for using his flat as a base. The gang took revenge by attacking Mr Pass after his friends had broken into the flat and stolen their drugs. Mr Pass's mother Josephine said: "I feel both angry towards the men who took Paul from me and great sadness for their mothers. "They have not only taken Paul's life, they have taken mine away as well because I feel like I have died."	Two teenage drug dealers who murdered a man in a revenge attack have been jailed.
Stephen Archer, 51, of Victoria Street, Openshaw, Manchester, was convicted on Thursday at Manchester Crown Court of murdering his sister Julie, 49. Ms Archer suffered 95% burns in the attack at her home on Surbiton Road, Newton Heath, in February 2016, the court was told. Archer was told he must serve a minimum of 27 years. The jury heard Archer had falsely accused her of murdering their father and uncle and doctoring a will to disinherit him. The court heard Julie was left with "horror movie" injuries after Archer doused her with flammable liquid and set light to the vapours as she sat on a sofa. Ms Archer's 19-year-old daughter, Quibilah Archer-Cunningham, escaped with minor injuries after jumping from an upstairs window of the house. The family dog died in the blaze. Archer was cleared of arson with intent to endanger the life of his niece.	A man who set his sister on fire using a "petrol cocktail" has been jailed for life.
Twelve people died in the 19 December attack. Amri fled to Italy and was shot dead by police in Milan. Investigators believe Bilel A, aged 26, was either involved in planning the attack or at least knew about it. Police say they have arrested him on suspicion of benefit fraud as they do not have enough evidence against him. Federal prosecutors' spokeswoman Frauke Koehler told reporters on Wednesday that the suspect had known Amri since the end of 2015 and that the pair had met at a restaurant on the evening before the attack and had "very intense conversations". The suspect's home in an asylum shelter had been searched and communication devices taken away for analysis, she added. The man is believed to have used at least two false names in several German cities between April and November 2015. A former flatmate of Amri's is also being investigated as a potential witness. Amri twice tried to contact him on 19 December, although it is unclear whether or not they spoke. Over a fortnight after the attack, German prosecutors have said there is now no doubt that 24-year-old Anis Amri was behind the attack. And investigators across Europe have a clearer picture of what happened on the night of the attack and how Amri fled south to Italy. Police in Italy confirmed on Wednesday that the gun used by Amri to murder Polish driver Lukasz Urban was the same he fired four days later in Milan. Shortly before the attack, Amri is thought to have gone to Friedrich-Krause-Ufer, a street where he shot dead Mr Urban. He then went to a mosque and returned to the lorry to carry out the attack on Breitscheidplatz a few miles away. Amri was then seen on camera a short distance from the square at Zoo station, raising an index finger, a gesture linked to jihadist group Islamic State. What happens next is unclear, but it is thought that he escaped to the North Rhine-Westphalia area of western Germany. His final journey took him through the Netherlands, Belgium, France and Italy, exploiting the open borders of Europe's Schengen zone. Some of Amri's story is yet to emerge. Swiss police said they too had opened an inquiry into the Berlin attack after receiving information from another police force.	Berlin police have detained a Tunisian man suspected of eating dinner with Anis Amri the night before he drove a lorry into a crowded Christmas market.
The Markit/CIPS manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index grew to 50.1 from 49.4 in April, which had been the lowest reading since early 2013. The 50 mark separates manufacturing growth from contraction, with the sector now just on the positive side. Manufacturing failed to boost overall UK growth during 2015 and early 2016. UK economic growth slowed to 0.4% in the first quarter of the year from 0.6% in late 2015, propped up by the services sector. Rob Dobson, senior economist at survey compilers Markit, said: "The manufacturing sector looks likely to act as an increased drag on the economy in the second quarter. "There are also signs that increased client uncertainty resulting from slower growth and the forthcoming EU referendum are weighing on investment spending and business decision-making in general." The report found that more than a third of manufacturers surveyed believed uncertainty over the EU vote has had an impact on their business, with 8% saying the effect was "strongly detrimental". The survey showed the investment goods industry experienced a difficult month, with production falling at the quickest pace since early 2013. Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight, said the manufacturing sector was "essentially at a standstill in May". Ruth Miller, UK economist at Capital Economics, said the small improvement for manufacturing in May did little to change the fundamental picture of a struggling industrial sector. "Granted, the headline PMI index recovered from its three-year low in April, ticking up from an upwardly revised 49.4 to 50.1 in May, above the consensus expectation of 49.6," she said. Ms Miller said this was still far below the average since the economic recovery picked up at the start of 2013. However, she thought the situation would "improve for UK manufacturers later this year". Overall new orders rose in May. Meanwhile, some firms said they were already pricing in the expectation that inflation will rise. Annual consumer price inflation currently stands at 0.3%.	UK manufacturing activity rose slightly in May, raising concerns over the economy's strength in the run-up to the 23 June European Union referendum.
Four women were celebrating on the River Dart, Devon, on Saturday when the vessel became stuck in mud as the tide went out. An RNLI spokesperson said the party were were travelling to Dartmouth when they got into difficulty. The spokesman said the group were "cold but otherwise unhurt". Posting on the Dart RNLI Lifeboat Facebook page the crew said: "They came back to the lifeboat station for a warm drink and to meet and thank the lifeboat crew. "The girls were on a hen party and the irony is that the bride to be had requested a 'no-fuss and low-key day'. "The hens who had arranged the day thought an afternoon afloat on the beautiful River Dart would set the mood for dinner in Dartmouth in the evening. "Best laid plans and all of that. I don't think they will ever forget the hen party."	A bride-to-be who wanted a "no-fuss and low-key" hen party had to be rescued by the RNLI after their hire boat ran aground in a river.
The UN committee on the rights of the child said all children should receive a "truly inclusive education". The committee is composed of 18 members drawn from countries including Bahrain, Spain, Italy and Ethiopia. Their latest report explores how the UK is implementing the UN charter on the rights of the child. However, it includes a number of recommendations specific to Northern Ireland. It says that in Northern Ireland education, "segregation by religion persists", and calls for the executive to "actively promote a fully integrated education system and carefully monitor the provision of shared education". The report goes on to say that abortion should be decriminalised in Northern Ireland "in all circumstances" and that the executive should "review its legislation with a view to ensuring girls' access to safe abortion and post-abortion care services." It also recommends that children should be able to decide on their own not to attend religious worship in schools, rather than having to be withdrawn by their parents. Religious education and acts of collective worship are currently compulsory in Northern Ireland schools. Parents do have the option to withdraw their child from these on the grounds of conscience. The CEO of the Integrated Education Fund (IEF), Tina Merron, welcomed the committee's support for integrated education. "This is a very welcome endorsement of the aims of the integrated education movement and represents recognition at the highest level that young people in Northern Ireland are largely growing up in a context of division and separation according to religious tradition," she said. "I am very pleased to see such a clear expression of support for education reform and would hope that it now becomes central in the new Executive mandate." Save the Children NI said another of the report's findings highlighted high levels of child poverty here. "We hope the NI Executive will take the UN Committee's recommendations seriously and implement them through the new Programme for Government," they said. The committee's full report makes almost 100 observations or recommendations in a number of areas including education, civil rights, care and mental health provision. However, the committee cannot compel UK governments to change legislation.	Unregulated transfer tests in Northern Ireland should be abolished, a United Nations (UN) committee has said.
David Jordan, 44, from Cavanalinn in Pomeroy, County Tyrone, is accused of the bomb attack on the officer in Castlederg in May 2008. The police officer was driving to start a night shift at a police station when a booby-trap bomb hidden under his car exploded. He escaped from the vehicle but suffered serious leg wounds. Mr Jordan is also charged with causing an explosion and belonging or professing to belong to a proscribed organisation. On Thursday, Gavin Coyle, 38, was also charged with attempting to murder the police officer. Mr Coyle, formerly of Culmore Park in Omagh, County Tyrone, but whose address was given as Maghaberry Prison, also faced charges of causing an explosion likely to endanger life and membership of the IRA. A detective told Friday's hearing at Dungannon Magistrates' Court that the two men were involved in a "joint enterprise" to try to kill the policeman. She said that when each charge was put to Mr Jordan during police interviews, he replied: "I am totally innocent of this fabricated charge." The detective added that the accused then said: "This is yet another case of internment by remand." Mr Jordan had originally been arrested in connection with the bombing in the days after the attack, but was released without charge, the court heard. The detective said police believe CCTV footage captured Mr Jordan and Mr Coyle driving two vehicles in the vicinity of the officer's house prior to the bomb. A trace of nitroglycerin was also found in the boot of a car later seized by police from Mr Jordan, the detective added. She said police were opposing bail as the defendant was connected to republican paramilitary groups and could commit offences if he was bailed, adding that he also posed a flight risk. But a defence lawyer told the court the evidence linking Mr Jordan to the attack was "non-existent". He rejected a claim that new evidence had emerged since his client's original arrest in 2008. He said: "This defendant should not be connected to these offences." Police expert analysis of the CCTV footage had not even been able to confirm the make and model of the vehicle, he said, and the car later impounded by police was not even registered to Mr Jordan. The solicitor also questioned the police's reliance on the nitroglycerin trace, saying the bomb used in the attack had been made of semtex. The judge refused Mr Jordan's application for bail. He is due to appear before Strabane Magistrates' Court via videolink on 17 December 17.	A man has been remanded in custody charged with the attempted murder of a Catholic policeman in County Tyrone.
It was gobsmacking, unbelievable, enthralling and explosive throughout, featuring huge momentum swings and with outstanding individual performances in all three Tests. I thought beforehand that if they lost the first Test the Lions would lose the series 3-0, so I have to give credit to what is the strongest Lions side since 2001, or maybe even 1997, for the way they fought back. The quality shone through both in the players and the coaching. After the first week or so the debate about lack of preparation time died down - that is one for the administrators to sort out behind closed doors. But just think what they could have done with 10 days' more time to get ready - they might even have gone in as favourites against the world champions. This will be a tour remembered for Sean O'Brien's try in the first Test. The Lions may have lost that match but it was a wonder try, and now the lads have managed to draw the series that score will be the one that sticks in the memory. Although that might be the standout moment, to be honest pretty much every moment of every Test was a defining moment - it really was that good. The most significant moment was Sonny Bill Williams' red card in the second Test. You don't know for certain what the outcome would have been had he not been sent off, but it's more than likely New Zealand would have won. That was effectively two defining moments - the impact of his shoulder with Anthony Watson's head, and the moment referee Jerome Garces - correctly - decided it was a red-card offence. It was a huge momentum swing in both the match and the series, although it didn't seem so immediately because the Lions proceeded to give away loads of penalties and slip nine points behind, before finally starting to believe in themselves and scoring two great tries as they fought back to win. Another pivotal moment would have been conversations after the first Test because the Lions had been dominated physically in many cases. The conversations must have been along the lines of looking players in the eye and saying: "Are you genuinely up for this?" Warren Gatland's decision to field the back three of Liam Williams, Watson and Elliot Daly in the second Test was a bit of a surprise but, as before with the coach's decisions, it worked out. And then there's the penalty that then wasn't in the final Test. Sam Warburton dug deep into the Lions' legacy and his own mental reserves to prevent New Zealand doing what they wanted to do with the ball. But arguably his biggest contribution was being respected enough by Romain Poite for the referee to change his decision and decide to award a scrum to New Zealand, rather than a very kickable penalty, right at the end of Saturday's decider. It was huge because, unless I've got the rules wrong, it was a penalty as the ball was avoidable for Ken Owens, while a scrum says contact was accidental. He caught it and although it was maybe a reflex action, catching and then releasing the ball suggests he could have avoided it. I have to say 'God bless the Kiwis', because on the pitch they accepted it. They will talk to the referee after the game, but during matches they just get on with it. They set the standards. Jonathan Davies was very good and was the Lions players' man of the series but for me the best player in a red shirt was Taulupe Faletau. The Wales number eight was so consistent, and I believe there's even more to come. He's a phenomenal athlete with a fantastic engine, which allows him to always play for 80 minutes in both defence and attack. I'd still like to see more of him carrying in the wider channels, but he was my man of series. Rugby is such a squad game it's a shame you have to pick individuals but Taulupe is a bit of an unsung hero and his work-rate and ability mean he made a massive contribution. His Wales team-mate Davies had a fine series. He made some great breaks, he was solid in defence without being headline-making, he assumed the role of carrying to the gainline in the second and third Tests, came up with a couple of good relieving kicks and played well all round. Maro Itoje showed his growing maturity by the way he pushed the boundaries - he was knowingly offside and doing it for a reason, which is great when you get away with it. He was magnificent in the third Test and at one point made four tackles in about 45 seconds. His willingness to be involved is staggering and a benchmark for anyone who wants to be the best. Owen Farrell's mental ability to step back and kick crucial penalties, especially after he missed a couple of kicks early in the tour, shows his ability to totally zone in when he has to - something New Zealand's Beauden Barrett, for all his other abilities, doesn't seem able to do. O'Brien was also impactful on the flank and made sure the Lions were on the front foot both in attack and defence, and his Ireland team-mate Conor Murray was very good at the base, helping run the game. I hope this series is a springboard for the home unions to believe there can be a shift in power in terms of the world rankings and beating the southern hemisphere teams on a more regular basis. Let's get fitter and really test ourselves. I don't think many of the home unions can compete on skills in the forwards with New Zealand but the back three the Lions fielded was probably more skilful and adventurous than that of the hosts, which shows the possibilities are there. There was some talk going into the series that the future of the Lions was once again under threat and what's interesting is that the posturing is coming from the clubs. I would like to think they're clever enough to go and do the negotiations behind the scenes now because they must realise how secure the Lions' future is. Ask a player, coach or supporter if they think the Lions is here to stay and there will be a resounding yes. That says everything that needs to be said. Jerry was talking to BBC Sport's James Standley.	We have just witnessed a phenomenal Lions series.
Harsent won the prestigious £20,000 award for his eleventh collection Fire Songs. It was his fifth nomination, dating back to 1998, but he had not previously won. Chair of the judges Helen Dunmore described Harsent as "a poet for dark and dangerous days". She added: "Fire Songs plumbs language and emotion with technical brilliance and prophetic power." This year's other nominees included former winners John Burnside and Michael Longley. The 10 shortlisted authors received £1,500 each. To mark the 50th anniversary of Eliot's death on 4 January 2015, the prize money for the winner has been increased from £15,000 to £20,000. Judges Dunmore, Sean Borodale and Fiona Sampson chose the shortlist from 113 books submitted by publishers. The TS Eliot Prize 2014 shortlist: Harsent's previous collections include 2005's Legion, which won the Forward Prize for best collection, and 2011's Night, which was shortlisted for the Costa, Forward and TS Eliot Prizes and won the Griffin International Poetry Prize. He is currently professor of creative writing at the University of Roehampton and a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. Harsent was presented with his award at a ceremony at the Wallace Collection in London on Monday. Previous TS Eliot Prize winners include Ted Hughes, George Szirtes, Carol Ann Duffy, Seamus Heaney, Derek Walcott, John Burnside, Sharon Olds and Sinead Morrissey. The TS Eliot Prize was launched in 1993 to celebrate the Poetry Book Society's 40th birthday and to honour its founding poet. The prize money is donated by the TS Eliot estate.	David Harsent has won the TS Eliot Prize for poetry at the fifth attempt.
Wilder's side were confirmed champions after rivals Oxford lost to Luton Town. "He's a very down to earth guy, he's a motivator and certainly gets us going for games," said Richards. "That hour before the game after we've warmed up he's certainly getting in each other's ears. It's loud in the dressing room, put it that way." Richards continued to BBC Radio Northampton: "But you can go to him and speak to him, anything about football or outside football. He's been first class for all the players this season." In November, the club owed repayments on a £10.25m loan to the local borough council, while they faced a winding-up petition from HM Revenue & Customs and the club's bank account was frozen. However, after a takeover from Kelvin Thomas changed the fortunes of the club off the pitch and Wilder and his team continued their fine form to win 10 matches in a row, and they are currently on a 20-game unbeaten run. Richards himself, though, has missed the run-in because of an Achilles injury, which needed an operation. "I've had a tendon taken out of each Achilles, apparently you don't need them, and I've had a scrape on my Achilles to take away the scar tissue," said the 33-year-old. "It'll be another week on my crutches, I should be back jogging within five weeks and then a week before pre-season starts I should be back to full fitness. "The idea behind getting the operation done now was to make sure I was ready for next season. Maybe I could have battled on through the last few games, but I wouldn't have done myself or the club justice."	Northampton Town striker Marc Richards has praised "first-class" manager Chris Wilder after the Cobblers won the League Two title.
The 23-year-old Frenchman had been on a season-long loan at Ajax but failed to score in his four appearances for the Eredivisie side. Ex-France international defender Rod Fanni, 34, has signed from Qatari side Al-Arabi for the rest of the season. The Addicks have also cancelled the deals of Franck Moussa and Ricardo Vaz Te by mutual consent. Belgian midfielder Moussa, 26, joined Charlton from Coventry City in the summer of 2014 while ex-Bolton, Barnsley and West Ham forward Vaz Te moved to The Valley in November.

Campaigners fought to save Ipswich Airport after it was earmarked for housing by Ipswich Borough Council, with some occupying the terminal building for about four months. The anniversary of the closure is being marked with an exhibition. Organisers said: "There is now a generation that probably doesn't even know Ipswich had its own airport." The site was formerly a World War Two airfield and home to RAF Blenheim light bombers, Hurricanes and - for short periods - Spitfire squadrons. During its 66-year history, the airport launched a daily flight to Clacton with a journey time of just 15 minutes in 1938 and it later handled flights carrying royal passengers and sports stars. In the 1980s, Suckling Airways started operating flights to Amsterdam and Manchester and by 1990 the airport housed flying schools, a helicopter school, parachute centre and various support firms. But in 1996 the borough council, which owned the airport, announced the site would close later that year, to be turned into what is now the Ravenswood housing estate. Saturday's exhibition at the town's Transport Museum has been put together by Ipswich Airport Association (IAA) whose members will be on hand to answer questions. The reunion and exhibition will also feature press cuttings, photos and memorabilia to mark 20 years since the airport officially closed on 31 December 1996. Martyn Steggalls, a director of the IAA, who worked part-time at the airport, said: "It's a time when a lot of people involved in the airport can get together and reminisce. "It's a focal point to people who used to fly from there, work there and lived nearby."	An airport that "refused to close" is being remembered this weekend, 20 years after flying eventually stopped.
It carries the simple name e-Delicious, and it takes the form of a box about the size of a large printer, containing sensors, and some computer circuitry, which act as an electronic tongue and nose. It was developed by Thailand's National Innovation Agency, at a total cost of $1m (£640,000), after former Prime Minister Yingluck Shinwatra complained about the poor versions of Thai food she was subjected to during her overseas trips. A Thai Delicious committee was formed - a bit like the French Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée for food and wine - and around 200 people were invited to sample different versions of classic Thai dishes like tom yum gung (sour prawn soup) and kaeng khiao wan (green curry). Whichever version was the consensus winner was taken as the standard, although the designers acknowledge that as the sampling was done in Bangkok, inevitably their standards for now are Bangkok versions. The e-Delicious machine has nine sensors in it to measure the balance of six Thai flavours - sweet, sour, bitter, salty, savoury and spicy - and the food's aroma. There is also a sensor to assess the dish's visual presentation, which is always very important in Thai cooking. But can it actually tell you if the dish is any good? "The machine can't tell you if something is delicious or not," says Nakah Thawichawatt, an entrepreneur who carries the grand title of Innovation Ambassador. "The sensors give a taste-reading that we can understand. So if we like a certain taste, but can't explain what that taste is to someone else, the machine will able to decipher it, and record the data as a standard for other dishes." We decided to give the e-Delicious a test. We had seen it sample low-cost versions of the recipes in its database - only three for now, but soon to reach 10 - and found them all wanting. But how would it cope with the tom yum gung that is judged by many in Bangkok to be the finest in the city? You won't find it in a ritzy restaurant in Bangkok's upmarket neighbourhoods, where Italian or Japanese cuisine is popular. Jay Fai, a formidable-looking woman in trademark beanie-hat and fire-engine slash of lipstick, is sometimes called the Mozart of the Wok, for the lightning speed and instinctive flair with which she wields that most essential tool for East Asian cooking. Her pad kee mao, or drunken noodles, is renowned: thick strips of white rice noodles fried in seconds over a roaring charcoal brazier, the meat, seafood, vegetables and chillies seared, glazed and smoky. But it is her tom yum gung they queue up for, despite a price tag that reaches $50 (£32) for a large bowl. Jay Fai tells me she learned her recipes from the old women who used to cook for the community on the village where she grew up. She is meticulous about ingredients, searching for the very freshest jumbo prawns, the most fragrant herbs - and tom yum gung relies a great deal on the galangal, lemon grass and lime leaves that flavour it, along with the fermented fish sauce, tamarind, lime juice, chillies and red onions. Watching her hurling great handfuls of herbs into the furiously boiling pot, it is hard to see any precision. And yet, after a couple of minutes she produces a soup of exquisite, overpowering taste and aroma. Once eaten, never forgotten, and for this reviewer, never equalled. At the Thai Delicious lab we spooned some of Jay Fai's soup into two glass beakers - one for taste, one for smell - and slid them into the e-Delicious machine. After a minute's processing, it delivered its verdict; for taste, 90%. For aroma, 100% - the highest score of any tom yum gung it had assessed. So perhaps a machine can judge great cooking. For a final view I called the chef at the first Thai restaurant ever to win a Michelin star: David Thompson, a true global culinary celebrity. His Bangkok restaurant Nahm has repeatedly been voted as one of the world's finest. "It's an impossible dream, to set one standard," he said. "Taste is so subjective." "There are standards, but the art of cooking is the epitome of humanity, with differences in taste, seasoning and technique that express the cook's character." And what about a taste robot? "It's a gimmick, a foolish idea," he said. "Any cook, any sound practitioner or craftsman knows that a robot can never analyse the product of the human hand." The developers of the e-Delicious machine are undeterred. Despite its high cost - at least $18,000 (£11,455) per unit - they hope they can sell a few to each country where Thai food has taken off, to offer at least a consistent standard by which Thai restaurants can come and have their versions of the Thai classics judged. And if that does not take off, they have also come up with a Thai Delicious app for smartphones.	At a small laboratory in a Bangkok suburb, a group of scientists has come up with what they hope is the answer to an old conundrum: how to tell if a Thai dish is authentic or not.

Cynthia Cheroitich, 19, said she drank body lotion because she was hungry and thirsty. She was only brought out on Saturday morning after security forces found a teacher she knew to convince her it was safe to come out. Ms Cheroitich said her ordeal began at around 05:30 (02:30 GMT) on Thursday when she and her fellow students were in class studying for their exams. "Suddenly, we heard the bullets and then we started coming out and then we said: 'What is happening?'" she told the Associated Press news agency. "We ran to our rooms, then these people came running, following us. When we reached our rooms, we hide under the beds." She said that their pursuers told them to come out of their hiding places, but she decided to hide in the wardrobe instead where she covered herself with some clothes. It was then that the gunmen entered the room. Ms Cheroitich described a scenario that other survivors have alluded to. Her roommates were taken out and divided up between those who were able to recite verses of the Koran and those who were not. It was not clear what happened to them. She said she found some bottles of body lotion where she was hiding and "drank all of them", describing it as "nice and lovely". But she was too scared to move. "I was just praying to my God," she said. It was not until 10:00 on Saturday, long after the attack ended, that the authorities were able to persuade her to come out. She told AP: "You know at first I did not believe it [when police came to rescue her], at first I was thinking that maybe they were the al-Shabab.  So I said: 'How do I know that you are the Kenyan police?'" It was only after a member of the college staff came to convince her that it was safe to come out that she emerged.	A survivor of the al-Shabab attack on Kenya's Garissa university campus has been describing how she spent more than two days in a wardrobe in fear of rampaging militants.
According to reports, South Korea sports minister Do Jong-hwan said North Korea could host some skiing events. He also said the countries may enter a combined ice hockey team. "We are happy to discuss his ideas. The Olympic movement is always about building bridges, never about erecting walls," said an IOC spokesperson. "We are looking at the comments of the new minister of sport, culture and tourism with great interest." The Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea, will take place from 9-25 February. In comments reported by the Korea Herald, Do suggested the North and South could enter one women's ice hockey team, helping to make Pyeongchang a "peace Olympics". He said he would discuss co-hosting at the Masikryong ski resort with Jang Woong, North Korea's delegate to the IOC. Earlier this month, South Korea's new president Moon Jae-in said North Korea could be part of a bid to co-host the 2030 football World Cup across north-east Asia. Moon, the son of refugees from North Korea, advocates greater dialogue with their neighbours.	Proposed collaboration between North and South Korea at the 2018 Winter Olympics has been welcomed by the International Olympic Committee.

Cyber-attacks, trolls, terrorist propaganda, sexism, racism, Twitter mobs... stop the web now, Mr Berners-Lee, we want to get off. So, when it came to compiling 2015's list of the most viral videos and memes (see 2012's, 2013's and 2014's), I decided to impose a couple of ground rules to keep things upbeat. Rule number one: nothing miserable. The world was a scary place in 2015. Consider this list a safe, feel-good haven. Rule number two: nothing in this list was created specifically to go viral. As in, a committee of advertising executives didn't sit around a room and decide how to spend money on making it a hit. Of course, everyone wants their posts to be popular, but let's just say this list is intended to feature some of the more organic fun. Off we go! One of the remarkable things about Ruairi McSorley is how he managed to change a tiny soundbite into a media career. Asked by UTV reporter Gareth Wilkinson about the weather conditions in Northern Ireland, McSorley's charming accent led to him being dubbed the most Irish man in the world. His "frostbit" soundbite has led to countless TV appearances, events and, soon, a charity single. If you're not a fan of American Football - and sometimes even if you are - the half-time show is the most interesting part of the sporting extravaganza. And not since Janet Jackson's wardrobe "malfunction" has their been a more talked about moment than singer Katy Perry's performance. She was joined on stage by two adorable backing dancers, although one of them, the shark on the left, struggled to keep up. Left Shark fever swept the world, coming to symbolise the daily struggles we all face to keep up with the world. Katy Perry's lawyers tried to trademark "left shark", but were denied. Also in February, a garment now consigned to history as simply "the dress" was stirring debate. Optical illusion, colour blindness', strange lighting - whatever caused the difference of opinion, the image of the white/gold or blue/black dress became one of the most shared of the year. And then we all agreed it was blue and black. Didn't we? If Katy Perry's Left Shark was a symbol of life's daily struggles, the shot of a weasel hitching a ride on a woodpecker is a reminder of how we should all be able to get along, no matter our differences. "Weasels are fearless," commented wildlife expert Lucy Cooke. Evidently! Also in March, shocking footage emerged from Thailand showing an elephant, clearly intoxicated, clambering into a bath. Did I say intoxicated? I meant adorable. Annual sense-of-humour-vacuum April Fools' Day brings a flood of prank videos. Most are terrible, but some are beautifully executed - like this magic from a maths teacher in California. It racked up an impressive 13 million views. Maths was a continuing theme in April. This brain teaser, originally posed to Singaporean schoolchildren, had the world scratching its head and arguing over the solution. Did you figure it out? (The answer's on Wikipedia…) "Spotted this specimen trying to dance the other week. He stopped when he saw us laughing." So wrote a poster on 4chan, the notoriously dark online message board. They attached a picture of Sean O'Brien, a large Liverpudlian, who had been dancing at a gig. After attention was brought to the apparent "fat-shaming", the internet rallied round and Mr O'Brien was tracked down. In May, the Dancing Man had a huge party thrown for him in Los Angeles - attended by Monica Lewinsky, Moby and Andrew WK. "I'm still pinching myself," Mr O'Brien said. Back in London, it was a "hipster cop" that had people talking. Peter Swinger - who sports a stylish, curly moustache - was spotted on duty at a protest march. However, according to the Daily Mail, a close relative said Mr Singer, a father of three, was "definitely not a hipster". What a hipster thing to say. Behold, the best double-take ever captured on film. Champion surfer Mick Fanning waiting just six days to get back into the water after this terrifying incident. The 34-year-old was competing in South Africa when two sharks appeared in the water. No problem for Mr Fanning, though - he just punched one of them and swam off, avoiding probable death. Kevin Innes found a pile of dog toys in a shop in Norway. And then he pressed them. The Guardian called the resulting clip the "best thing on the internet today". I'd go as far as declaring it the best thing on the internet this entire year. Why? It sums up the very best thing about viral hits - that ability to give the entire world that "oh, you had to be there" experience. Also in August, everyone melted after watching this little lad who definitely isn't going to miss his mum when he's at school. The undoubted star of this next clip is the woman in the passenger seat. Quiet, stoic… resigned. Next to her, the now world-famous Ronnie Pickering. Who? Ronnie Pickering. Who? RONNIE PICKERING! Mr Pickering's road rage was captured on film by cyclist Steve Middleton, and spread around the world as people asked: "Who's Ronnie Pickering?" The video can be viewed here, but be warned it contains a flood of swear words. Mr Pickering's son later took to Twitter to say his Dad's a great guy and a great laugh. So, let's give him the benefit of the doubt - we all have our off days. Meanwhile, in September, this Manhattan rat was having the "on" day to end them all. In this internet age, it's quite reassuring that the humble music video format still has the ability to get people talking. Though now, it's not enough to merely like a music video - you have to remix it. Hip hop artist/dancing visionary Drake's video for Hotline Bling spawned hundreds of remakes. To save you the time, just watch this one - it's by far the best. For a short while in October it seemed that every cat owner in the world was buying up cucumbers to scare their cats. (Although it must be said that experts later advised against it - it's pretty mean.) There are numerous theories as to why cats seem to jump out of their skin at the sight of a cucumber - one expert, speaking to ABC News, said it's because cats are genetically wired to bounce away from snakes. Ever since the demise of CBBC's Record Breakers, the public's appetite for world-beaters has been left unsatisfied. Good job we've got Otto, then, a bulldog who rode a skateboard through the legs of 30 people. If there's one thing we've learned this year, it's that being Irish increases your viral potential by roughly 100x. Here, TV news reporter Teresa Mannion took to the coastline of Galway, in the west of Ireland, to broadcast to RTE viewers. But Storm Desmond had other ideas, giving poor Ms Mannion a right blustering. "Don't swim in the sea!" she screamed in her dramatic live report. And then the internet got to work. And on Christmas Day, a lot of Dads fell off their hoverboards. So, there we have it. An eclectic year of road rage, Irishness, dresses and sharks of varying ferocity. The next year could see big changes to the internet. Debates on encryption and censorship may alter the very fabric of how this series of tubes works. But through it all, let's hope we keep our sense of humour and not take ourselves too seriously. When life gives you cucumbers, make a video. Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC (and tell me what I missed!)	It's been a bit of an annus horribilis for the internet and all of us who frequent it.
According to a committee in charge of policing the morality of Iran's football federation, Sosha Makani's outfit was deemed inappropriate and against Islamic values. However, committee chief Mahboub Afrasiabi said it was only rumours that Makani was suspended because of the style of his trousers and that the matter would be dealt with after Ramadan. The issue of Makani's "SpongeBob SquarePants" comes at a time when social media users in Iran have been voicing anger at what they see as the systematic targeting of public figures by the conservative establishment. In an apparent attempt to calm the atmosphere, Sadra Mohaqeq, an editor at reformist newspaper Shargh Daily, tweeted: "The extent of reaction and the government's dealing with an incident, such as Sosha's trousersâ€¦ is a direct result of its coverage across social media platforms." However in a sign of the strength of feeling, another Twitter user took issue, responding with: "What kind of analysis is this? You mean to say people should not oppose anything? That we no longer have the right to oppose anything? That we shouldn't even voice an opinion?" The public furore around the Makani case has caused a stir among the authorities who fear it could put the cultural integrity of the country in jeopardy. Observers have suggested that to the government, Makani's trousers represent a step towards individuals straying from conservative religious teachings of the clergy and how Islam should govern their daily lives. The goalkeeper's attire is only the latest example of personal expressions to have fallen foul of the establishment. Recently, Taraneh Alidoosti, a celebrated actress who displayed a feminist tattoo on her left arm, drew the ire of hardliners who called for her to be banned from the screens. That too followed the arrest of seven Iranian fashion models, who were charged with "promoting Western promiscuity". Six of them who were women had posted pictures of themselves without headscarves on Instagram. In a televised trial, one of the models, Elham Arab, emphasised that fame and beauty were universal desires but acknowledged there was a "price to be paid". The models were arrested as part of an ongoing operation against "loose hijab" - code for immodest dress. The head of Iran's cyber-crimes court said the campaign had been stepped up to "monitor the use of social media by the Western imperialist powers to change the Iranian-Islamic life-style of our nation". While on the face of it, the government's concern with a man's choice of trousers might appear an overreaction, in the bigger picture it can be seen as an attempt to perpetuate a policy imposed since the Islamic revolution of 1979. This was echoed by an Iranian Twitter user, Bahareh, who pointed out that women have been subjected to scrutiny for years. "Your silence for when they condemn girls for their hijab should prepare you for their inevitable harassment when it comes to the colour of men's trousers," she tweeted. The Iranian government has even gone as far as accusing US celebrity Kim Kardashian and the CEO of Instagram of using "un-Islamic" methods aimed at corrupting Iranian youth. The disconnect between the authorities and ordinary people over Makani's ban was summed up by respected Iranian sports reporter Pejman Rahbar. "The six-month ban has been issued by an institute called an 'Ethics Committee', a place that reminds one of an illusionary Utopia, governed by a fake mayor," he posted on Facebook. "Their views are reflected in their ruling; an institute that we are powerless to confront whilst Iranian footballs roll like little marbles in the hands of a few on top."	The story of an Iranian goalkeeper suspended for, reportedly, wearing trousers with a motif similar to the cartoon character SpongeBob SquarePants raised eyebrows around the world - but the case highlights some of the tensions at play in the country.

27 June 2016 Last updated at 16:41 BST Even though the UK as a whole voted to leave the EU, in Scotland most people voted to remain. Now, some people are saying that Scotland should get independence from the rest of the UK, so that it can join the EU again on its own. Naz has been in Scotland to see what kids there think.	One of the biggest questions to come out of the historic decision that the UK should leave the European Union is about the future of Scotland.
Team Sky's Gianni Moscon is facing disciplinary action from Team Sky after it emerged he used racially abusive language towards FDJ's Kevin Reza at the end of Friday's stage three. Italian Moscon apologised and rode in Sunday's final stage. "Any complaint will be investigated," the UCI told BBC Sport. Team Sky chose not to withdraw Moscon from the race following discussions with FDJ. Moscon has apologised to Frenchman Reza and his team-mates but the British team will consider what action to take after establishing all of the facts of the incident.

Media playback is not supported on this device Victory in Toulouse on Monday would secure Wales' spot in the knockout phase, in their first major international tournament since 1958. "This team has got the potential to go on and on. They've got everything to look forward to," said Coleman. "We are in a fantastic position. Nevertheless, there's more to come." Wales, who beat Slovakia 2-1 in their opening game before losing 2-1 to England, could still qualify for the last 16 with a draw against Russia. Coleman added: "Whilst everybody will look at this game as the be all and end all, whether we progress or not it's not the end of the journey for this team. "Our players have done unbelievably well. It's been an eye-opener and hard, of course. It's really intense but it's been enjoyable." Coleman said that, however far Wales progress in France, the players will "learn from this tournament". He said: "This group, this team, they can't lose because whenever we go home, whenever that time is, we have gained so much experience. "Normally we get to a certain level and in June we are playing a friendly game - we are playing the Netherlands, who are already qualified and who are planning for a tournament. "Now we are at a tournament ourselves and this group gets all the praise and accolades they deserve. And it is not over for us." Joe Allen has welcomed Wales' Euro 2016 day of destiny by saying the squad are determined to have no regrets over the tournament. "You don't want it to be the be all and end all in the sense that you take your foot off the pedal at any time in the future," said Allen. "You want to make sure that this is something that we get to experience again, but playing at this stage as a footballer is the highest level - and we certainly want to make sure that there are no regrets on our part. "I think coming off the pitch no matter what happens, we're confident we'll do the business. "We want to make sure that we throw absolutely everything at it. "We're confident that we can get ourselves into the knock-out rounds and, after that, who knows what could happen?" Allen says Wales will shut out what is happening in the England game with Slovakia as qualification is in their own hands. The two matches will be played simultaneously as Group B draws to a conclusion. And the Liverpool midfielder promises a positive approach against Russian opponents who need to win to keep their own last 16 hopes alive. "It's a difficult one," he said. "It's one where people think if you set up just to cling on to that point it can often be the downfall of teams. "That won't be our approach, but it is one where we want to make sure we are more in control of how we go about our performance. "Performing well is first and foremost what we want to do, because we know when the focus is on doing that then the results come with it." Wales assistant boss Osian Roberts confirmed Wales have a fully-fit squad to choose from for the Russia game. Pick the XI that you think can take Wales far at Euro 2016 - and then share it with your friends using our team selector.	Wales boss Chris Coleman says Euro 2016 is "not the end of the journey" for his squad as they prepare to face Russia for a place in the last 16.
It was a "good opportunity" and "a chance to work together," a top Western Sahara official told the BBC. Morocco controls two-thirds of Western Sahara and sees it as part of its historic territory. However some, including the UN, see Western Sahara as Africa's last colony. Africa Live: More on this and other stories Find out more about Western Sahara A referendum was promised in 1991 but never carried out due to wrangling over who was eligible to vote. Thousands of Sahrawi refugees still live in refugee camps in Algeria - some have been there for 40 years. It is not clear what happens next but Western Sahara is hopeful that a committee set up by the AU will address the issues that both sides have raised. Some AU delegates said that it would be easier to resolve the issue with Morocco inside the AU. Sidi Mohammed, a Western Sahara official, told the BBC that Morocco's return to the AU means that it would now be expected to put "in practice decisions taken by the AU with regard to a referendum in Western Sahara". Mr Mohammed dismissed the suggestion that Morocco would now seek to get the AU to change its position, saying that the no country could unilaterally change the AU fundamental agreement, saying it opposed colonisation. In his speech at the AU summit, King Mohammed VI of Morocco said the readmission was not meant to divide the continental body. No. Algeria has always been a big supporter of Western Sahara's Polisario Front and it had wanted Morocco to accept independence of the territory as a condition for readmission. Zimbabwe and South Africa were also supportive of this stance but they were outnumbered by those who wanted Morocco back in the fold. There is no specific provision in the AU charter that bars any country from joining it. Morocco simply applied and the request was accepted by more than two-thirds of the 53 members. Morocco has been involved in intense lobbying and applied in July last year to rejoin the continental body. King Mohammed toured various African countries seeking support for the bid. No. While culturally the country's identity aligns with Arab states, its economic interests increasingly lie in Africa. This is a strategic move to continue exploring its interests in mining, construction, medical, insurance and banking sectors on the continent. Moroccan troops went into Western Sahara after Spain withdrew in 1975.

Transport for London (TfL) announced a public consultation process to decide how the city's private hire trade should be regulated. Proposals include improving the driving and English language skills of drivers and stricter insurance requirements. But Uber said that the proposals would raise prices and add to congestion in London. "It's meant to be a public consultation but it clearly hasn't got the public's interests at heart," said Gareth Mead, Uber Europe's spokesperson on the Today programme. An online petition called called Support Uber London has received more than 123,000 signatures, stating that the proposals would lead to a five minute waiting time before a customer can begin their Uber journey. "There will be a mandatory five minute wait time, even if a car is available just around the corner. You won't even be able to see the nearest cars when you open the app", the petition claimed. Mr Mead said of the proposed five-minute wait for trip confirmation: "As the night's draw in, it's starting to get colder and darker. I'm not quite sure how that [proposal] benefits anybody." Earlier this week Garrett Emmerson, a senior executive at TfL, said in a statement: "In recent years the private hire industry has grown exponentially and technology has also developed rapidly. The consultation sets out a number of ways that standards across the industry could be raised. "No final decisions have been made and we're keen to hear a range of views from the trade and from Londoners too." The Californian technology company has faced resistance from taxi drivers around the world, who argue that Uber drivers escape regulation. But Mr Mead said Uber drivers are subject to the same measures which govern the private hire industry, including background checks and licensing requirements. Responding to criticism that Uber cannot ensure that its drivers are taking rest breaks, Mr Mead said: "One of the advantages of a digital technology company is that you can see, to the minute, what they [drivers] are doing, and we tell them when they need to take a break." Mr Mead said that since Uber launched in London a year ago, it had gained 1 million users in the capital.

They say that the new material is more robust and hardwearing than previous efforts to create artificial cartilage. A traditional ink-jet printer combined with a specialised spinning-machine is used to make it. It could lead to bespoke cartilage created for individual patients. But one expert warned it was too early to be confident it would ever be used. The study was published in the Institute of Physics' journal Biofabrication. It marks the latest effort to use 3D printers in medicine following the use of a machine to make a replacement lower jaw and efforts to create 3D-printed scaffolds to support the growth of bone cells. Scientists said they were able to build cartilage made from a chemical compound known as a polymer coated with cartilage cells from a rabbit's ear. They combined the ink-jet printer with a machine that uses an electric current to spin very fine fibres from the polymer solution. It allowed the construction to be easily controlled, meaning scientists could make the artificial cartilage porous. This is key to encouraging real cartilage cells to integrate into the surrounding tissue. So far the printed cartilage has been tested on mice and, after eight weeks, appeared to have developed the properties of real cartilage, suggesting it has potential for insertion into human patients. The scientists said that in the future it could allow medics to create cartilage specific to each patient's needs. They suggest an MRI scan could create a blueprint of a body part, such as a knee, and matching cartilage could be made using the 3D printer. "This is a proof-of-concept study and illustrates that a combinations of materials and fabrication methods generates durable implantable constructs," said James Yoo, a professor at the Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine, and one of the paper's authors. At present one of the best options available to doctors treating cartilage damage is a technique called microfracture surgery. It involves drilling small holes into the bone in the cartilage's gap to encourage bleeding. Scar tissue then forms over the gap, acting as a replacement for the missing cartilage. But it is not generally suitable for older or more obese patients, and it does not work if the lesion is too large. Dr Richard Weiler - a consultant in sport and exercise medicine at University College London Hospitals - told the BBC the new innovation could potentially offer respite to a wider range of the patients he treated. But he had doubts about whether it would ever be used. "Certainly with sport there are injuries that cause damage to cartilage - we have seen this with some famous footballers, cyclists and other athletes who have had traumatic injuries where the cartilage has been damaged and then drops off and doesn't grow back very well in the affected area," he said. "However, there have been lots of previous cartilage replacement technologies that were shown to have had an effect in animals but have proved not to be as good as hoped when used long-term by humans. "This technology sounds an interesting development, we would just want to make sure it's safe."	Researchers have developed a way to "print" cartilage that could help treat joint diseases and sporting injuries.
The Tiangong-1 or "Heavenly Palace" laboratory was launched in 2011 as part of an ambitious Chinese plan to catch up with other space powers. However, a senior space official has said the lab had "comprehensively fulfilled its historical mission". The lab is currently intact and orbiting at 370km above ground. Speaking at a press conference last week, Wu Ping, deputy director of the manned space engineering office, said: "Based on our calculation and analysis, most parts of the space lab will burn up during falling." She added that it was unlikely to affect aviation activities or cause damage to the ground. But in comments reported by the Guardian newspaper, Dr Jonathan McDowell, an astrophysicist at Harvard University, suggested China might have lost control of the station. "You really can't steer these things," he said. "Even a couple of days before it re-enters we probably won't know better than six or seven hours, plus or minus, when it's going to come down. "Not knowing when it's going to come down translates as not knowing where its going to come down." Most of the 8.5-tonne station would melt as it passed through the atmosphere, Dr McDowell commented, but some parts such as the rocket engines, were so dense they might not burn up completely. Earlier this month, China launched its second trial space station, called Tiangong-2, in a bid to operate a crewed outpost in orbit by 2022.	China's first space station is expected to fall back to Earth in the second half of 2017, amid speculation authorities have lost control of it.
Media playback is not supported on this device Do you get your business done early, or drag it out until the last minute? What tricks of the trade can an agent use? How do you keep your player happy? What kind of clauses/add-ons go into a contract? BBC Sport spoke to David Seligman, an agent at CM Sports in Manchester and an expert in sports law, and renowned agent Eric Hall for some insight into the type of last-ditch negotiations that occur when the transfer window is about to shut. Seligman currently represents a number of Football League players while Hall's client list once included the likes of England internationals Dennis Wise, Tim Sherwood and Neil Ruddock. "If it gets to deadline day, you know there isn't any time for the club to go and get somebody else, so the price goes up and you get them the better deal," says Seligman. "If you talk to your Harry Redknapps, Alex Fergusons and Terry Venables, they won't wait until deadline day if they fancy a player," says Hall. "Deadline day just gives people like me and the players extra ammunition. "On deadline day, you just go 'chat, chat, chat, chat'. Keep them chatting until you're near to that deadline hour and then they will give you anything, within a certain reason, that you want. Ask for everything because as silly as some stuff may sound, you'll probably get it. "I remember quite a few years ago, I took Kenny Sansom from Arsenal to Jim Smith and Newcastle and I got three times more than I probably should have got." Seligman adds: "I negotiated a lower league player's release from his contract at one club in January and we were offered £5,000 to cancel his contract two days before the window closed. "We waited and one hour before the window closed I got him double that. We were playing a game of chicken - we kept saying we wouldn't accept it - and it went down to the wire and the price went up." "It's all about assessing who has the power - the club or the player," says Seligman. "I once represented a player who had not scored a goal for a long time but he had played at a high level so, in his head, he wanted to earn a certain amount of money. "I eventually got him £2,500 a week after one club had initially offered £700 a week. He got a £10,000 signing on fee, too. From my point of view, when I first touted the player to the manager concerned, he was very interested. I gauged that by the fact he rang me back 25 minutes later after he'd done some digging and watched some videos. "He said there and then there would be an email with a contract offer within the hour. At that point, I knew I had the power - he was the club's number one target." "When you're dragging it out a little bit, that's where an agent really has to earn his corn," says Seligman. "You have to find the right balance between keeping the player happy and making sure the deal is not lost. "A conversation needs to be had with the player on how far they want to push it, because it's their career. If you get to a point where the player says they don't want to push it too far, then you have to agree and take the deal that's on the table. "This is where a good agent and a bad agent are separated because if you're a good agent, you are able to analyse the situation and use your contacts in the game to see if a club is speaking to other players and get the player to trust you. "You don't want to lose a deal, but you don't want to cave too early." "There's no point in being underhand," says Seligman. "You play them off against each other by being honest. If they think another club is interested it can ramp the wages up." Hall recalls: "I took Tim Sherwood up to Blackburn a few years ago. The same day, I was doing a deal with Derby where Arthur Cox wanted to sign Tim (who was at Norwich at the time). "I was playing games with my lovely mate [then Rovers manager] Kenny Dalglish and I kept him hanging on. You play one against the other. But if you're good at your job, you shouldn't play too many games. You mustn't underestimate chairmen either because most have the money to buy a club because they are good businessmen. They are not idiots." "Another trick is to say the deal if off by saying the offer is unacceptable," says Seligman. "Or you can bring a player's family into it and say the player can't justify the travel because he's got a young family, and then the club say they'll put him up in a flat and help out with that. If the club really want the player it is important to not only look after him but his family too. "Conversely, I had a player last summer who was offered 50% more than what he was earning at the time elsewhere but he turned it down because his girlfriend couldn't move. That's just the real world - she couldn't move in her line of work." "I had one player who wouldn't take a second year at a club because he thought he would get a bigger move and earn more money elsewhere - on the advice of his wife," recalls Seligman. "He got paid up after six months. "I've had a lot of English lads who are small and they say to me they want to make it in Spain," says Seligman. "'The game is better suited to me in Spain', 'my dad said it'd be better for me in Spain' but I tell them that if they are good enough to play professionally in Spain, they are good enough to play professionally in England. "People don't like being told a few home truths, but as an agent you have to balance it. You're dealing with human beings who are temperamental and footballers can be more temperamental and egotistical than most." "It can be useful to use media stories and hype too," admits Seligman. "If a player gets talked about a lot, whether it be on social media or in the press, there is more attention attracted to them. "If you have a player who is spoken about a lot, you have people wanting to watch him. I had a player who was scouted by a Championship club (he eventually signed for another Championship club) because there were just so many people talking about him and they didn't want to miss out. You have to create that 'don't want to miss out' philosophy. "I've put out stories before now saying that my client has been watched by three or four clubs in a higher division because (a) it's true and (b) it raises their profile." "I've already told my players to build up their Twitter following over the next few months and when it comes to negotiations, we can get clauses built in there," says Seligman. "If you're a player at a club and you're always giving away your boots, shirts and signed stuff, the fans will love you. Becoming a fans' favourite gives you more power, it helps when you're negotiating a new contract. "Also, you can go to a club on a commercial level and say 'Look, I've got 20,000 followers on Twitter and you can put promotions out via my Twitter feed. That can aid the club, and in return I want an extra £100 a week.' That's a more innovative term in a contract. "If you have two identical players and you're not sure which one to choose but there's one who you can make more money out of commercially, social media is a new way of doing that," adds Seligman. "We've seen financial analysts and pundits justifying high transfer fees and wages for Gareth Bale at Real Madrid and David Beckham at LA Galaxy by the amount of shirts they sell. It's that but on a smaller scale. It's all about making more money." "I had a player called Richard Duffy, who was on loan at Coventry from Portsmouth," says Hall. "His loan was due to finish about a week before the deadline and then I got a call from Coventry. "They said they wanted to keep my player until the end of the season. I said 'That's great, if Portsmouth agree, but I want three times more for his wages, plus this, that, a car and a little house for him to live with his girlfriend.' "Because it was a couple of days before the window was going to shut, and Coventry were struggling at the time, they came up with it." Seligman adds: "A lot of the time, I get my client a relocation fee or expenses. I use a guy who is really good at relocating players. He sources everything like schools, nurseries… whatever is necessary. Anything which makes a player comfortable should, in theory, make him play better." "The things that tend to work well for my clients are to get things like performance bonuses worked into the contract," says Seligman. "You can get a goal bonus - £100 per goal, £200 per goal, etc, or 10 goals can earn you £1,000. Clubs prefer that - to do it per five, 10 or 15 goals - but as an agent I'm not a fan of that. "I had a big argument with a chairman at a Conference club once. He proposed my client got a £2,000 bonus if he got 20 goals - £100 a goal really - but I said I didn't like that because if he scores 19 goals and gets 10 assists you're going to be delighted with him but he won't get his bonus. "His reply was that he'd sort something out but that wasn't good enough - it's all well and good saying that in August, it needs to be in the contract." Hall recalled: "I remember saying to Terry Venables [on one particular deadline day] that I wanted my player to get £5,000 if he scores a goal. He was a goalkeeper!"	How do you get a player the best deal on transfer deadline day?
The justices said they would hear a combined case about marriage bans in four states. But a supreme court ruling on the cases could fully legalise gay marriage in the US. The court previously struck down a US law preventing federal recognition of marriages in states allowing same-sex unions. After that ruling, a wave of decisions in the regional federal appeals courts ended numerous state gay marriage bans. Thirty-six states and the District of Columbia now issue marriage licences to same-sex couples. Fourteen state bans remain. On Friday, the justices said they would take up cases from gay and lesbian plaintiffs in Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio and Tennessee. In November, a US appeals court overturned rulings striking down marriage bans in those four states, the first appeals court to do so since the Supreme Court's initial gay marriage ruling. The US high court previously declined to intervene in cases that had made it to the appeals court level, effectively allowing marriages to go forward. During two-and-a-half hours of arguments, the justices will consider two related questions - whether the US constitution requires states to issue marriage licences to gay and lesbian couples and whether states must recognise such marriages performed in other states. The case will be argued in April and a decision is expected by late June.	The US Supreme Court will rule this year on whether gay couples have a right to marry across all states.
The event on 27 May offers 46- or 95-mile routes snaking through the scenic Trossachs and the Campsie Fells north of Glasgow. The ride will raise money to develop young Scottish cycling talent acknowledge the fabulous contribution made to Scottish and British cycling by Millar, who was born in Glasgow in 1958. His fourth-placed finish in the 1984 Tour de France was a record for a British rider and has since been matched only by Bradley Wiggins in 2009. For three of the organisers, the sportive is the perfect way to celebrate Millar's achievements. They hope it will safeguard his legacy. Billy Bilsland, Brian Smith and David Lang are respected figures in the Scottish cycling scene. Millar was a pupil of Bilsland's at his circuit training classes in Glasgow in the late 1970s. A veteran of the professional continental racing circuit, Bilsland and fellow Glasgow Wheelers stalwart Arthur Campbell helped nurture the fiercely ambitious Millar and set him on his way to France. Smith, now manager of the Endura racing team, trained with Millar when his hero returned home from racing across mainland Europe. He picked up the Scots pro baton that was handed from Bilsland to Millar and raced in the same Motorola team as Lance Armstrong. He is a trusted friend of the enigmatic Scot - and a cycling nut. "Didn't I see you win the Glasgow-Dunoon race in the '80s?" I wondered. Smith, from Paisley and now based in Kent, replied that he had indeed won, aged 18 and at his first attempt - and he could even remember the gear combination he used in the final 25-mile section. Media playback is not supported on this device Lang, who captains Millar's former club, the Glasgow Wheelers, said: "In my opinion, he is definitely the best stage rider that Britain has ever produced. "Yet I'm sure if you stopped most people in the street and asked them who Robert Millar is, most Glaswegians wouldn't know. "So we looked at the possibility of setting up a sportive in Robert's honour. "He did a lot of his training over the Crow Road, between Lennoxtown and Fintry, and that is the final climb. "The circuit also goes over the Tak Me Doon from Kilsyth, which is tough as well." Millar's steely determination and aggressive climbing skills saw him finish fourth in the 1984 Tour de France, as well as securing second places in the Tours of Spain (twice) and Italy. And then there were apparent contradictions: self-deprecating and shy or self-assured; pony-tailed waif or tough as teak; proud of his roots or occasionally dismissive - "the Caledonian antisyzygy" on two wheels. Lang put it thus: "Robert was very much a loner. He was determined to be a world-class cyclist and it didn't really matter who he upset to get there." Bilsland, to whom Millar gifted his 1984 King of the Mountains polka dot jersey which now hangs on the wall of his bike shop, added: "Robert was special. "He was focused on what he was about. He believed in himself. When he attacked, he attacked to win. "I think he was one of the few Scotsmen who ever got their photograph on the front cover of L'Equipe. "I believe if he had the backing of the Sky team now, he would have won the Tour. Media playback is not supported on this device "When he was with Peugeot, a lot of the French guys didn't want to ride for him. A lot of the victories he got on his own merit." The sportive, Lang believes, is the first time Millar has allowed his name to be used for a cycling event. The intensely private Millar gave his permission to Smith as long as proceeds went to the Glasgow Wheelers' development squad for young riders and the Braveheart Fund, which Smith established a decade ago to improve young Scottish cyclists' prospects. "He was one of my idols," said Smith. "He used to come back in the winter to Glasgow. Every year he came round to the house and gave me a jersey. "I was fortunate then; I was just as small as him so I could use them. "And now, to have a Robert Millar Sportive is fantastic because the legacy of the name will go on. "Every hill that you go over will remind you how difficult it was to become King of the Mountains in the biggest annual sporting event in the world."	A generation after Robert Millar mesmerised British TV viewers with his assaults on Pyrenean peaks in mid-1980s Tours de France, a sportive in his honour will test riders on the roads on which he trained.

Adams won on her professional debut on Saturday but was frustrated to fight over four two-minute rounds. "Every time I felt I was getting close to a stoppage the bell would go for the end of the round," said Adams, 34. On Tuesday, WBC president Mauricio Sulaiman said the organisation "will never allow three-minute rounds". Sulaiman said some boxing jurisdictions had taken "steps backwards" in allowing longer rounds in the women's sport. He said the organisation would "limit the dehydration and the fatigue elements to lower as much as possible the risk of a tragedy". Flyweight Adams' next bout in Leeds on 13 May is on the undercard of Josh Warrington's WBC International featherweight title fight with Kiko Martinez. As Adams' fight is not for a WBC title, the British Boxing Board of Control (BBBofC) have allowed for the extension of the bout to four three-minute rounds. Ireland's London 2012 Olympic champion Katie Taylor has also called for the move and Adams' management believe it will be the first time a women's bout has featured the same length of rounds as their male counterparts in the UK. "Female boxing has come a long way since Jane Couch MBE made the sport possible here in the UK in 1998," said Adams. "However, there is still a way to go until both male and female boxers can campaign under the same competition rules." Adams is now intent on winning the right for women to wear lighter gloves. The BBBofC's rules specify women must use 10oz gloves, a factor Adams' management believe is even more limiting than round length as gloves become heavier with perspiration as a fight progresses. "It's great that the BBBofC has supported this first change and hopefully changes to glove sizes will come next," said Adams. In the men's game, fighters competing from flyweight to welterweight are allowed to wear 8oz gloves. BBC Radio 5 live boxing pundit Steve Bunce said a move to 8oz gloves would allow Adams to show her power, adding the current 10oz rule was "not good for business".	Double Olympic champion Nicola Adams will contest three-minute rounds in her next fight, a contrast to the standard two minutes in women's boxing.
The 85 children had to eat peanut protein every day - initially in small doses, but ramped up during the study. The findings, published in the Lancet, suggest 84% of allergic children could eat the equivalent of five peanuts a day after six months. Experts have warned that the therapy is not yet ready for widespread use. Peanuts are the most common cause of fatal allergic reactions to food. There is no treatment so the only option for patients is to avoid them completely, leading to a lifetime of checking every food label before a meal. The trial, at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge, tried to train the children's immune systems to tolerate peanut protein. Every day they were given a peanut protein powder - starting off on a dose equivalent to one 70th of a peanut. The theory was that patients started at the extremely low dose, well below the threshold for an allergic response. Once a fortnight the dose was increased while the children were in hospital, in case there was any reaction, and then they continued taking the higher dose at home. The majority of patients learned to tolerate the peanut. Claire Rooney describes the daily anxieties of having a daughter with multiple food allergies. 'Niamh's allergies have changed our lives' Lena Barden, 11, from Histon in Cambridgeshire, said: "It meant a trip to the hospital every two weeks. "A year later I could eat five whole peanuts with no reaction at all. "The trial has been an experience and adventure that has changed my life and I've had so much fun, but I still hate peanuts!" One of the researchers, Dr Andrew Clark, told the BBC: "It really transformed their lives dramatically; this really comes across during the trial. "It's a potential treatment and the next step is to make it available to patients, but there will be significant costs in providing the treatment - in the specialist centres and staff and producing the peanut to a sufficiently high standard." Fellow researcher Dr Pamela Ewan added: "This large study is the first of its kind in the world to have had such a positive outcome, and is an important advance in peanut allergy research." But she said further studies would be needed and that people should not try this on their own as this "should only be done by medical professionals in specialist settings". The research has been broadly welcomed by other researchers in the field, but some concerns about how any therapy could be introduced have been raised. Prof Gideon Lack, who is running a peanut allergy trial at the Evelina Children's Hospital in London, told the BBC: "This is a really important research step in trying to improve our management of peanut allergy, but is not yet ready for use in clinical practice. "We need a proper risk assessment needs to be done to ensure we will not make life more dangerous for these children. He warned that 60% of people with a peanut allergy were also allergic to other nuts so a carefree lifestyle would rarely be an option. Prof Barry Kay, from the department of allergy and clinical immunology at Imperial College London, said: "The real issues that still remain include how long the results will last, and whether the positive effects might lead affected individuals to have a false sense of security. "Another issue to address is whether there will be long term side-effects of repeated peanut exposure even where full allergic reaction does not occur, such as inflammation of the oesophagus. "So, this study shows encouraging results that add to the current literature, but more studies are needed to pin down these issues before the current advice to peanut allergy sufferers, which is to avoid eating peanuts, is changed." Maureen Jenkins, director of clinical services at Allergy UK, said: "The fantastic results of this study exceed expectation. "Peanut allergy is a particularly frightening food allergy, causing constant anxiety of a reaction from peanut traces. "This is a major step forward in the global quest to manage it." Prof Simon Murch, an allergy expert at the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said: "This is clearly a promising paper but it certainly isn't a cure. "Nevertheless this study does point towards a promising new direction of therapy and once further testing has been carried out, and techniques refined, it may prove to be a therapy with widespread use in hospitals in future." But he added: " This is not something that should be undertaken at home, or indeed outside specialist centres."	Doctors say a potential treatment for peanut allergy has transformed the lives of children taking part in a large clinical trial.
A number of homes were inundated in Gorleston and nearby Bradwell on Sunday. The flooding followed a 90-minute downpour. Jonathan Wilby, of Great Yarmouth fire station, said: "Drains and pumping systems were unable to cope with the amount of rain." He added: "We prevented some homes from being flooded by pumping water away."	Torrential rain caused flash flooding of homes and businesses in coastal areas of east Norfolk.
The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) also said emergency workers had to delay their response because some explosive cartridges were still live. Its report said the seats were a "significant hazard" that delayed rescue teams until they were made safe. The Hawker Hunter jet plummeted on to the A27 on 22 August killing 11 men. A final report is still to be published by the AAIB, but seven safety recommendations have been made in the bulletin, which has looked at the safety of ejection seats and the maintenance of ex-military aircraft. The AAIB said manufacturer support for the jet had ended after it was retired from military service, and its technical manual had not been updated. The explosive cartridges for the jet's ejector seat and canopy had expiry dates of June and July 2014, more than a year before the crash. Sussex Police said officers were at the scene immediately after the crash and the issue of the ejector seats arose when victim recovery was taking place and the aircraft had to be lifted. The AAIB report also said investigators could not determine if the aircraft met the requirements of its permit to fly from December 2014 onwards. Aircraft that do not qualify for a standard certificate of airworthiness - generally former military or amateur-built planes - are able to operate with a permit to fly granted by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). But the AAIB report revealed that initially the CAA "could not determine" if the Hawker Hunter met the requirements of its permit, because of doubts over the validity of the maintenance of its Rolls-Royce engine. It recommended the CAA review its procedures over issuing such permits to ex-military aircraft. A CAA spokesman said it was examining the AAIB bulletin in detail, but stressed it did not contain any information about the cause of the crash. He said the CAA had told the AAIB investigation the jet had a valid maintenance record at the time of the crash. "The aircraft did have a valid permit to fly at the time of the accident and was therefore permitted to operate," he added. Work had been carried out on the aircraft in January 2014 and the next inspection was due in January 2016, the CAA said. The AAIB said investigations would continue and it was still examining the aircraft and its maintenance records to determine its exact condition before the accident. Pilot Andy Hill has been interviewed by police, it was confirmed last week.	A jet that crashed during the Shoreham air show, killing 11 men, had expired ejector seat parts and an out-of-date technical manual, a report has said.
Think of Iraq and Afghanistan - their crystal ball is often as muddy as yours or mine. While the 2010 Strategic Defence & Security Review (SDSR) did identify terrorism and international military crises as high level (tier 1) threats, there was no specific mention of Russia and so-called Islamic State (IS) did not exist in anything like its present form. The 2015 SDSR will identify both IS and Russia as tier 1 threats, but they may not be the same threat five years hence. They say that armies train to fight the last war they fought and military plans don't survive the first contact with the enemy. "In 2010 it was rather assumed the armed forces would get out of Afghanistan and take a bit of a breather," says Michael Clarke, director of the defence think tank Rusi. Instead "the world has shown us the armed forces won't be getting a holiday," he says. First, the government should be commended on its commitment to carry out a defence review every five years. Before, defence reviews were done ad hoc. But ministers will still have to overcome a high degree of scepticism as to whether this latest SDSR is genuinely "strategic" or if it matches Britain's global ambitions with the resources needed. SDSR 2010 may have been strategic in name but it'll be remembered for the savage cuts that followed. It wasn't just the scrapping of iconic names, it left gaping holes in Britain's defences - with no aircraft carriers for the Royal Navy and no maritime patrol aircraft to hunt down Russian submarines. Full document The Royal Navy also lost thousands of personnel and is now having to recruit marine engineers from foreign navies. In order to man its two new aircraft carriers it'll need another 2,000 sailors but they'll have to manage with fewer, which could mean mothballing other warships. The armed forces are still licking the wounds inflicted by the 2010 review. Defence Secretary Michael Fallon admits it involved "painful" decisions. But this week he told me: "We're now able to expand the defence budget again... to enhance the capabilities of our armed forces to deal with the increased threats we face." Key to this, he says, has been the commitment to meet the Nato target of spending 2% of the nation's wealth (GDP) on defence. It means there'll be a modest increase in the defence budget over the next five years. Mr Clarke says while the armed forces might be in a better place this time round "it'll still find it difficult to meet all the commitments the government wants it to meet". New maritime patrol aircraft will be top of the shopping list. Over the past five years Britain has had to call on the help of the US, Canada and France to hunt for suspected Russian submarines near UK waters. RAF crews have already been training on the US Boeing P8 Poseidon - but it's expensive. Other defence contractors are offering cheaper alternatives. Britain needs new aircraft now, but it has to work out what it can afford. The RAF will also be looking for more frontline fast-jet squadrons. It now has seven squadrons but would like more than a dozen. In the fight against IS it's still having to rely on the ageing Tornado. The life of some of the early Typhoons is likely to be extended to add a few more squadrons, but still probably fewer than the RAF would like. One key decision will be how many of the new F-35s Britain will buy. The aircraft, also known as the Joint Strike Fighter, is already the most expensive defence project ever undertaken by the Pentagon. The UK had originally planned to buy 138, but each jet will cost about £100m. The decision on F-35s is also important for the Royal Navy and its two new aircraft carriers from which they will fly, as are new anti-submarine frigates needed to protect the carriers. The Navy wants 13 of the new Type 26 frigate. If it has to settle for less that would have a knock-on  effect on shipbuilding jobs on the Clyde. The government will also signal its push to renew the fleet of Vanguard submarines which carry the Trident nuclear systems. The cost of building four new submarines will be updated from around £20bn to more than £30bn. The Army will be looking at how many new armoured "scout" vehicles they'll be getting and new Apache attack helicopters. Although the Army has become less likely to engage in any large-scale conflict on its own, it still needs a range of capabilities to deploy alongside its key ally - the US. The Army also hopes this SDSR will help change public perceptions - that it's not just there to deploy en masse. The Army now sends small teams to trouble spots all over the world to help train and assist fragile states with conflict prevention. The number of regular troops is shrinking, from 163,000 in 1978 to 102,000 in 2010 and 82,000 in 2020 The government has said it does not want whole regiments to be scrapped; some will be merged, others face "salami slicing". The Army will become more reliant on part-time soldiers; the number of reservists will double from 15,000 to 30,000 by 2020 The government says Britain will have an effective, well-equipped fighting force, integrating regulars and reserves Analysts say the Army will have resources for only one major operation at a time and there will be swingeing cuts to support units such as logistics and engineers More on the Army reorganisation In fact, this SDSR will signal a significant break with the past. Mr Clarke says: "What we are seeing is a shift of resources away from fighting major wars towards using the forces in more intelligence-led, cyber-led, Special Forces-led ways for specific operations." The armed forces still want and need their big ticket items like warplanes and warships, but recent events have underlined the shift. In the wake of the Paris attacks, ministers have said the security services will get another 1,900 personnel while there'll be an extra  £1.9bn for cybersecurity and another £2bn for Special Forces. The RAF will see the size of its drone fleet double to 20. It's a sign the military will be involved in more intelligence-led counter-terrorism operations and an indication that, post-Iraq and Afghanistan, politicians are increasingly reluctant to put "boots on the ground". After the brutal cuts of the last SDSR, ministers hope this one will be a positive story. While the Ministry of Defence is still having to make efficiency savings, it's not being asked to make cuts right across the board like many other government departments. But more important than how the review is regarded by the public, or the armed forces themselves, is how it's interpreted by Britain's allies and enemies.	Military chiefs, civil servants and politicians are not always ready or equipped to fight the battles in front of them, let alone the wars of the future.
Ron Stone has been described as a "true champion" of St George West, the ward he had represented on Bristol City Council since 1985. The leader of the Labour group at the council, Helen Holland, said: "Ron will be remembered as a steadfast campaigner and committed socialist." Mr Stone died aged 73 on Wednesday. Ms Holland said he was "dedicated to furthering social justice and equality in Bristol and beyond". She added: "The Labour Party has lost one of its most committed councillors. "Bristol is a better city because of Ron Stone's unwavering public service." The city's mayor, George Ferguson, said Mr Stone had "an undying passion for Bristol". "I always enjoyed his directness and wry humour - even when directed at me. "As a councillor for St George West for 30 years, Ron had a vast knowledge of his neighbourhood and the people he served, making him an excellent ward councillor who made a real difference. "With his keen sense of social justice, Ron made an enormous contribution to life in Bristol. He was an 'establishment rebel', always without his civic robes but seldom without his camera, recording people and events." Mr Stone's roles at the council included chairing the licensing committee and the St George Neighbourhood Partnership. The lord mayor of Bristol, councillor Clare Campion-Smith, said: "Ron was a hugely dedicated councillor who made a great contribution to his community, constituents, the council and the city over his 30 years of service. "He was an active and passionate councillor whose presence in the chamber enlivened and enriched any debate."	Tributes have been paid to a long-serving Labour councillor who has died following a short illness.
The promotion-chasing Lions took an early lead as Byron Webster headed past keeper Reice Charles-Cook from Shane Ferguson's corner, However, Shaun Williams was sent off for Millwall after just 26 minutes when he appeared to headbutt Ruben Lameiras. Coventry took advantage as John Fleck's 30-yard shot was followed up by Marcus Tudgay's toe-poke to grab victory. With four matches remaining, Millwall remain fifth in the play-off places, three points clear of seventh-placed Barnsley. Coventry, climb a place back up to 12th, eights points adrift of the play-off places, after only their third win in 17 matches. Sky Blues boss Tony Mowbray told BBC Coventry & Warwickshire: "On the balance of the play it was deserved. It's never easy to play against 10 men. "But we saw it home. Now we have to see if we can finish the season strongly. "It's important for the supporters of our club to see that we are fighting for every point." Millwall manager Neil Harris told BBC Radio London: Media playback is not supported on this device "The sending off was a big blow. Having just looked at it quickly, I've got no complaints. "We looked really solid, really organised. I couldn't remember us giving too many chances away other than the opportunity just before half-time. "I'm delighted with the players because the spirit they showed and the fight they showed to get a result was terrific with ten men."	Coventry overcame 10-man Millwall at the Ricoh Arena to secure their first victory in six League One matches.
Beauly will be the only representatives of the lower leagues in the semi-final draw at BBC Scotland's Pacific Quay on Monday 11 July. This follows a heroic 1-1 draw away to in-form Kinlochshiel in which Beauly held a lead for more than half the game. Lochaber also came close to creating an upset when they forced Kyles to come from behind twice to earn a 2-2 draw at Tighnabruich. Camanachd Cup rules require drawn games to be replayed. Meanwhile, at The Eilan, Newtonmore cruised to a 4-0 lead over Skye who then struck back with two late goals. Kilmallie showed little regard for Oban Camanachd's Premiership status and went ahead three times in the first half through Liam MacDonald, Brian MacKay and Duncan Rodger only to be pulled back on each occasion by MacCuish. Connor Howe then got Camanachd's winner just after the hour. Marc MacLachlan opened for Beauly after just three minutes and it was 11 minutes into the second half before John MacRae struck for Shiel to take the tie to a replay at Braeview. Ben Delaney got Lochaber's opener and Dunky Kerr Kyles' first equaliser just before half time. Neil MacDonald shot Lochaber ahead again and Grant Irvine secured Kyles' second bite at the cherry at Spean Bridge. An Evan Menzies double in the first half and one each from Norman Campbell and Iain Robinson in the second had Newtonmore on easy street. Jordan Murchison struck back with two in the last six minutes but by then it was too late for Skye. In the Marine Harvest National Division a goal in each half from Alan MacDonald helped Inveraray to a 4-1 victory on Bute which extended their lead to four points. The new second-placers in the five horse race for this title are Glasgow Mid Argyll who have three games in hand. This followed a 12-0 rout at Ballachulish where Gary Luke with a hat-trick headed a list of seven different scorers.	Andrew MacCuish scored a hat-trick of equalisers for Oban Camanachd before the highly-fancied Premiership side eventually edged into the semi-finals of the Camanachd Cup 4-3 at Kilmallie.
Elderly World War Two veterans lead the crowd. And many of the participants are carrying flowers to lay at the Freedom Monument, Latvia's symbol of national independence. They have come here to commemorate those who died defending Latvia against the Soviet Union in the war. But with Russian troops now in nearby Ukraine, many in the Baltics are alarmed that history may be about to repeat itself. "If Ukraine falls, then Russian ambitions won't stop with this. I believe we will be next in Russia's list of actions," said one young man who had come to take part in the procession. "It shows the attitude of Russia - how it goes into another country very easily and acts in an aggressive manner," said another. But this annual memorial service is highly controversial. These elderly veterans fought against Russia - but for Nazi Germany. The Baltics have spent much of their history being buffeted between neighbouring imperial forces. And in WWII, having already suffered severe oppression under Stalin, many Latvians saw Hitler's forces as the lesser of two evils - Latvia's only chance of not slipping back into Stalinist oppression. But the veterans and their supporters are accused of being Nazi sympathisers - particularly by Latvia's large Russian-speaking community. About 1,000 Russian-speakers have gathered behind police barricades near the monument to protest. "Fascists go home!" shout some. "Shame! Shame!" shout others. This year security is particularly tight, with as many police officers as participants, amid fears that the instability in Ukraine will spark ethnic tensions here. It is a similar dynamic to Ukraine: pro-Moscow local Russian-speakers accusing pro-Western nationalists of being right-wing extremists. And like Ukraine, some Russian-speakers here say they are discriminated against by mainstream society. "I feel like a person who is second-class," says Aleksandr Gaponenko, a Russian-speaker who moved to Soviet-era Latvia with his parents 59 years ago, when he was a one-year-old. "We want equal rights for our languages, and we want equal social and economic rights." Latvia country profile According to the Latvian authorities, throughout the 20th Century people from elsewhere in the USSR were resettled in the Baltics as a deliberate Soviet policy to water down Baltic culture and destroy local national sentiment. And still today Russian-speakers are sometimes pejoratively called "occupiers". So when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, Mr Gaponenko, like many Russians, was not automatically granted Latvian citizenship, and lost his job in Riga city council. Today he is classed as a "non-citizen" - which means he is still not allowed to work for the state and does not have the right to vote. Around 300,000 Russian-speakers, or 13% of Latvia's population, are so-called "non-citizens". And they live in an EU member state and member of Nato. To become Latvian, they have to prove their knowledge of the Latvian language and culture in a citizenship test - even if they were born here. Some Russian-speakers, such as Mr Gaponenko, refuse to take the test, saying that the country where they have spent all their lives should grant them citizenship automatically. Others, particularly older people, say they do not speak Latvian well enough to pass the test. But the Latvian government says it is encouraging all residents of Latvia to become citizens. And it accuses the Kremlin of using the issue to stir up resentment within the local Russian-speaking population and create political instability. "There's massive propaganda, even an information warfare - not only here, and not only using Russian-speaking media, but also using other channels," says Latvian Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkevics. Russian-speakers often live very separate lives from their Latvian neighbours, living in different neighbourhoods, often socialising in different places. In Riga city centre, one bar might be full of local Russian-speakers, next door packed with ethnic Latvians. Estimates of numbers of Russian-speakers vary. According to Latvian pollster SKDS, Russian-speakers make up 42% of the population in Latvia, with 58% described as ethnic Latvian. This split in society is exacerbated by the political system. The parties popular with ethnic Latvian voters manage to form convoluted governing coalitions to stay in power. Meanwhile Harmony Centre, a party voted for mainly by Russians-speakers, is stuck in opposition - despite having won more votes than any other single party in the last parliamentary elections of 2011. Most problematic, says political analyst and pollster Arnis Kaktins, is that Russian-speakers often consume all their news from media produced in Moscow, while ethnic Latvians tend to get their information from Latvian or Western news outlets. So the two communities are developing opposing views about who is to blame for the crisis in Ukraine. "When so many people rely heavily on Russian news sources, it means that Russia has an instrument to change their minds if it would like to," says Mr Kaktins. There is a fear that the Kremlin could encourage Latvia's predominantly Russian-speaking border regions to follow Crimea's example and break away from Latvia to join Russia. All three Baltic States are in Nato, so it is seen as unlikely that the Kremlin would send in troops, and start a conflict that the West would feel obliged to respond to militarily. The real worry is that the crisis could increase divisions within Latvian society. Since independence in 1991, Latvia's two communities have lived side-by-side peacefully. But if the conflict in Ukraine gets worse, the rift could grow between Russian-speakers who support Russia's President Vladimir Putin, and ethnic Latvians who support the West.	A mournful procession of about 1,500 Latvians winds its way through Riga's medieval Old Town singing traditional Latvian songs.
The 23-year-old joined Real at the age of 14 and was part of their Champions League-winning squads in 2014 and 2016. He will link up with former Sevilla boss Unai Emery, who succeeded Laurent Blanc as PSG manager in June. "It will be a great pleasure to work under the direction of Unai Emery, who has developed an excellent reputation," Jese told the PSG website.	Paris St-Germain have signed Spanish forward Jese from Real Madrid for an undisclosed fee on a five-year deal.
However, observers inside the court said the prosecution evidence was difficult to follow or to understand. Correspondents said the most prominent video clip was by another al-Jazeera journalist who is not on trial. The three, including ex-BBC reporter Peter Greste, deny spreading false news and helping the Muslim Brotherhood. They appeared in the Cairo court on Tuesday along with other Egyptian students and activists being tried with them. Defence lawyers complained they were unable to understand some of the recordings being played because of poor technical quality. While the recordings were played, defendants talked among themselves in the caged dock. The trial was later adjourned until 3 May and bail for the defendants was denied, reports from the court said. Peter Greste, producer Baher Mohamed and al-Jazeera English's Canadian-Egyptian bureau chief Mohamed Fadel Fahmy have been held since December. A fourth al-Jazeera reporter, Abdullah Elshamy, who works for the network's Arabic channel, has been detained since August but not charged. Egyptian authorities accuse the journalists of aiding the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood, which has been banned as a terrorist group.	A court in Egypt has been shown video and audio evidence in the trial of three al-Jazeera journalists accused of terrorism-related offences.
Transport for London (TfL) had wanted to provide £30m for the proposed £175m bridge set to stretch from Temple to the South Bank in Lambeth. But talks broke down after Lambeth Council said not enough had been done to attract private sector backing. Chair of the Garden Bridge Trust, Lord Mervyn Davies, said he was "delighted to move forward with the project". In September, Lambeth Council halted negotiations and said it would only proceed if assurances were made that £30m was not taken from Transport for London. Lambeth council leader Lib Peck said: "I'm pleased we've successfully agreed a deal that will cut London taxpayers' contribution towards the Garden Bridge by two thirds." Plans for the bridge were approved in 2014, after Lambeth and Westminster City Councils granted planning permission with the chancellor and London Mayor Boris Johnson pledging £30m each, and the rest due to come from private funding. Lord Davies said: "We have been hugely successful in our efforts to raise funds from the private sector, with £85m pledged to date, and we have agreed that any of the committed funds from TfL spent over the £10 million will be treated as a loan." But Liberal Democrat Caroline Pidgeon from the London Assembly said: "While I welcome a reduction in Transport for London's payment towards the Garden Bridge, today's announcement simply raises more questions than it answers. "Why did TfL ever agree in the first place to contribute £30m to the Garden Bridge?  How much will TfL be willing to lend the Garden Bridge Trust?" The Trust said it hoped to begin working on the site in the New Year.	Financial contributions to the Garden Bridge by London's public transport network have been limited to £10m.
The Glasgow club said the employee, who is now dead, had worked at Partick for two years. When the alleged abuse was raised in 1992, he was dismissed "with immediate effect", the club said. Police Scotland and the Scottish Football Association have been informed. In a statement, Partick Thistle said: "As far as Thistle's current management can ascertain, no other allegations were made to the club at that time with regard to him or any other employee. "The club has contacted the SFA and Police Scotland to advise them of what they know to date and will fully comply with any investigation." "In the meantime, Partick Thistle would urge anyone who may have been affected to contact Police Scotland, the SFA, the club or the NSPCC helpline (0800 0232642) set up to support and advise victims of abuse. "In the last 24 hours, we have been approached by an anonymous individual asking for advice on who to contact with concerns relating to historic events. No details were given. The club advised he ring the NSPCC hotline in line with SFA guidance." The club added that it regarded the safety and wellbeing of the children and young people who have contact with the club as being of "paramount importance".	Partick Thistle Football Club has said it has identified a historical allegation of abuse made against a former club physiotherapist.
Administrators' reports suggest around £7m of £10.25m lent to Northampton Town by the local borough Council was passed to 1st Land Limited. A total of £2.65m was then given to David Cardoza and his father, Anthony. David Cardoza declined to comment, saying: "I'm under confidentiality so can't speak." A report from March this year showed a dispute arose between the Cardozas and 1st Land, which has since gone into administration, over the money. The Cardozas called it a "Joint Venture Fee" - money paid to one party to help carry out a jointly-run project - but 1st Land said it was a loan. It is unclear what has since happened to the money. The £10.25m loan was originally paid to the League Two club for the redevelopment of the new East Stand at Sixfields Stadium, along with a hotel and conference centre - none of which have been completed. Contractors Buckingham Group were appointed to carry out the works, with 1st Land appointed to oversee the development. When the company went into administration, it owed Northampton Town £7.3m and Buckingham Group more than £2m. The Cardozas and fellow businessmen, Howard Grossman, his son Marcus Grossman and Simon Patnick, feature as directors of several firms with business links to 1st Land and a second company appointed to oversee the development - County Developments (Northampton) Limited or CDNL. Many of these companies have gone into liquidation. Howard Grossman is listed as the only director of 1st Land; which is owned by another Grossman firm, County Group. The administrators' report also lists payments of £314,000 to Howard Grossman for his salary; £1.475m to County Homes (Herts) Ltd and £233,000 to County Cemetery Services Limited. The director of County Homes is also Howard Grossman. County Cemetery Services lists two current directors: Marcus Grossman and Simon Patnick. David Cardoza was a director of the company until August last year. It has also gone into administration - but not before a sale agreement was made with a company called Centurion Infinity Limited; whose directors are Marcus Grossman and Simon Patnick. After the collapse of 1st Land, CDNL took over the job of facilitating the Sixfields development. Its current directors are listed as David and Anthony Cardoza, while Marcus Grossman and Simon Patnick resigned directorships in January. That company has now also entered liquidation. The club faces a winding-up petition, due to be heard on 16 November, from HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC).	A football club chairman and his father were given a "loan" of more than £2.5m by a company set up to oversee the development of its stadium.
Royal Mail said the rise of delivery firm Whistl could wipe £200m off sales. It also said competition was endangering its government-mandated Universal Service, which guarantees a single price postal service that delivers to all UK addresses. The caution came as Royal Mail reported a small fall in pre-tax profits. They dropped to £218m for the six months to 28 September, from £233m in the same period last year. In its financial statement, Royal Mail named Whistl, formerly known as TNT, as a direct threat to future profits. The company also said it faced increased parcel competition and that Amazon's recently-launched delivery service could singlehandedly dent its business by as much as 2%, in the short term. In the past six months, Royal Mail's UK parcel delivery division saw revenues fall by 1%. However the firm's international parcel delivery service, GLS, fared well, with revenue up 7%, helping the company's overall revenue to rise by just £5m to slightly above £4.52bn. Royal Mail's letter business saw volumes drop by 3%, although this was not as steep a fall as had been expected. The slower decline was due to election pamphleteering, particularly relating to the Scottish Referendum, for which Royal Mail delivered seven million campaign mailings and over five million poll cards. Royal Mail boss Moya Greene told the BBC that increased competition was threatening the company's ability to deliver letters to all parts of the UK - a service mandated by law. She added that the "cherry-picking" of urban mail routes by competitors "undermines the economics" of its nationwide delivery service. Royal Mail has long called for the regulator, Ofcom, to consider expanding the Universal Service mandate - which ensures mail is delivered across the UK, six days a week, at one fixed price - so that it includes rivals such as Whistl. That may include forcing competitors to also deliver letters to rural areas at an affordable price - a service for which companies can make little or no profit. "We believe the current regulatory framework does not fully address the problem posed by unfettered direct delivery competition," Royal Mail said. "We think there is an urgent need for a new framework that will secure the sustainable provision of the Universal Service for the future." In response, a spokesman for Ofcom said the regulator's own evidence "clearly shows that the service is not currently under threat". "We would assess any emerging threat to the service quickly, in the interests of postal users," he added. Royal Mail has been under increased public scrutiny since it was privatised in October 2013. In July, a group of MPs voiced concerns that the taxpayer may have lost out by about £1bn after Royal Mail shares were "undervalued". After an initial pricing of 330p, Royal Mail shares rose above 600p in the months after its flotation, but have been steadily declining since the early summer, to 430p. Analysis: Kamal Ahmed, BBC Business Editor Lurking on page 8 of today's numbers is the real story in Royal Mail's results - that the business is warning of a "material risk" to the Universal Service obligation. Some may dismiss this as special pleading from a company that does not much like competition. But I have just spoken to the Royal Mail's chief executive, Moya Greene, and she is clear - if action isn't taken now, Royal Mail's ability to fund the six day letter delivery service across the UK will come under possibly unmanageable strain. "The threat is now," she told me.	Shares in Royal Mail closed down 8.3% after the firm warned that rivals - including Amazon - were eating into its parcel delivery business.
The 33-1 shot, ridden by David Mullins and trained by Mouse Morris, triumphed at Aintree in April to become the first novice to win the race since 1958. The nine-year-old, owned by the Gigginstown House Stud, has twice recovered from a cracked pelvis. "We didn't want to send him back to Aintree with a big weight, that wouldn't be fair," said Gigginstown's racing manager Eddie O'Leary. "He provided us with our first Grand National and we'll never forget him." BBC horse racing correspondent Cornelius Lysaght: "As the first Grand National winner for owner Michael O'Leary's burgeoning Gigginstown House Stud as well as the first novice chaser to win the race in nearly 60 years, Rule The World has his place in history. "Though he ran highly respectably at Punchestown after Aintree, O'Leary had already hinted that, having defied serious injury to reach one of the great pinnacles, he had perhaps done his bit. "What a season for Gigginstown, with success at Aintree, in the Irish National and Cheltenham Gold Cup, but at a price. Rule the World has been retired and there are doubts whether Gold Cup winner Don Cossack will race again."	This year's Grand National winner Rule The World has been retired.
The man, named by state media as Ji Zhongxing, 34, from central Shandong province, was injured and taken to hospital. No-one else was hurt in the blast, which filled part of the Terminal 3 arrivals hall with smoke. An online microblog attributed to the man says the explosion was to protest at his ill-treatment by Chinese police. The blog suggests his lower body was paralyzed after he was alleged to have been heavily beaten by security agents in southern China in 2005. Mr Ji, who is alleged to have been operating an unlicensed motorbike taxi service, was also apparently dissatisfied with the way his complaints against the authorities had been dealt with. State news agency Xinhua said he detonated the device - a package of gunpowder taken from fireworks - after being prevented from distributing leaflets. Photos posted on China's Weibo microblogging site showed a dark-haired man waving a white package in the air before the explosion. Later images from the airport showed the wheelchair on its side with officials treating him on the floor. Smoke drifted through the terminal after the blast, which occurred shortly before 18:30 (10:30 GMT) near one of the arrival gates. Xinhua showed several medical workers providing emergency treatment, with police officers also at the scene. Officials say order has been restored at the airport and there is no disruption to flights.	A man in a wheelchair with an apparent grievance has detonated a small device at Beijing International Airport.
Trams ran in the city between 1904 and 1953 before being replaced by buses. In December, they returned to the streets with the opening of the Midland Metro service - the first part of a Â£128m project. Once complete, trams from Wolverhampton will continue in to Birmingham, terminating at New Street station. Roger Lawrence, chairman of the West Midlands Integrated Transport Authority said: "This is an opportunity to expand. Not just into the city centre but out to the airport. "We will have a network to rival the best ones, like Manchester and Nottingham and even south London. Our network will equal those". At its peak, the original tram network ran 230 million passenger journeys every year from Yardley to Dudley, and from Erdington down to the Lickey Hills. Elsie Field, now 91, began working on the trams as a conductress when she was 18. Part of her job was using a pole to connect the tramcar to the overhead power lines. She said although she was short-sighted she was "too proud to wear her glasses, so the connection was sometimes a bit hit-and-miss". Tram enthusiast Geoffrey Claydon grew up in Birmingham and said he was disappointed when his regular commute was replaced by a bus service. "I said why have the trams gone and was told 'Oh, they're old fashioned'. From that moment I thought I would be very supportive of trams, I would do my best to try and keep them where I can for the rest of my life". When working as a government lawyer, Mr Claydon helped design the Transport and Works Act of 1992, which paved the way for the Midland Metro Line. "I can now feel quite smug. It was an immense satisfaction that I've lived long enough to see trams back and the poor souls who got rid of them have been proved wrong". Inside Out West Midlands has a full report on the history and reintroduction of trams in Birmingham on BBC One, Monday at 19:30.	The reintroduction of trams to Birmingham will "give the city a network to rival the best", a transport official has said.
The company blamed the "market decline in Eastern Europe" for offsetting strength in Asian markets. Carlsberg shares are down more than 9% in Copenhagen. Ukrainian sales fell by an estimated 17% "as a result of the deteriorating economic climate as well as significant price increases" applied to keep up with high inflation, the company said. "For the full year, we therefore do not expect that the strong Asian performance will be enough to offset the weaker than expected results in Western Europe and the challenging market conditions in Eastern Europe," said chief executive Cees 't Hart. Bad weather also hurt the brewer's bottom line in Western Europe. The company also reported adjusted net profit fell 23% to 1.73bn Danish kroner (Â£163m) in the first half of the year. Mr 't Hart joined the company in mid-June. "While I'm delighted with the enthusiasm and commitment of our employees, I also recognise that we must step up further to achieve the full potential of the group," he said. "To do so, we have initiated a process of revising the group's strategy to re-establish and further strengthen our financial flexibility." Carlsberg's brands include Kronenbourg 1664, Holsten Pilsner and of course, Carlsberg. Earlier this month, Carlsberg's rival, Heineken, reported better than expected first-half results.	Shares of Danish brewer Carlsberg are falling sharply, after the company lowered its annual profit forecast.
The Holy Trinity fighter had a 3-2 majority win against the World and European light-welterweight title holder to reach the quarter-finals. Monday's victory also secured his place at the World Championships in Hamburg, Germany in August. Belfast flyweight Brendan Irvine is also through to the quarter-finals. The Rio Olympian beat Turkish opponent Bathuhan Citfci on a unanimous 5-0 decision to advance to the last eight, the victory also securing his place at the World Championships. McComb, who easily dealt with Czech Erik Agateljan in his 64kg opener, had previously defeated the top-ranked Russian at a multi-nation tournament in Dublin in April. However this victory is much more significant, the fighter tweeting "nothing won yet, I'll just keep trucking" after his great win in Kharkiv. He now meets England's Luke McCormack in the quarter-finals.	Belfast boxer Sean McComb is one fight away from a medal at the European Championships after stunning world number one Vitaly Dunaytsev in Ukraine.
The 32-year-old was attacked in St George's Gardens shortly after midnight on Wednesday 12 July. Detectives have appealed to two witnesses who saw the suspect and the victim shortly before the attack took place. They said two men passed the woman and her attacker and spoke to both of them as they walked towards Sandy Row. Police are appealing for these men, and other potential witnesses, to come forward with information which may assist their investigation.	Police are investigating a serious sexual assault on a woman near Sandy Row in south Belfast.
Police said the last thing the man remembered was leaving a bar in Manchester city centre at 01:00 GMT. He apparently woke up in a confused state before contacting Greater Manchester Police at about 15:00 GMT. Thousands of people are expected to celebrate the festive season in what has come to be known as Mad Friday. GMP tweeted about the man's nightclub ordeal, and said officers were searching for people with access to the building in order to free him.	A man dialled 999 after waking up locked in an empty nightclub dressed only in his underpants following a Christmas party.
Faull was part of the famous British and Irish Lions side who beat New Zealand in Auckland in 1959. He made 12 appearances for Wales and played in four of the six Tests in the 1959 Lions tour. He also played three times for the Barbarians. John was also the son of former international referee and former president of the Welsh Rugby Union, Wilf Faull.	Former Wales and British and Irish Lion John Faull has died aged 83.
Now in his 60s, Othman and fellow villagers in the town of Wana, 22 miles (35km) north-east of Mosul, still depend on the dam as a vital source of water and irrigation for his crops. "Life is water," said Othman, who is proud of his Kurdish roots, adding that his ancestors have lived in Wana for the last 800 years. Sitting on an earth mound on the edge of his field, and puffing on a cigarette, he said his family had been uprooted from the town just once, when militants from the so-called Islamic State (IS) captured Mosul Dam and Wana in August 2014. IS extremists were forced to retreat from the dam after 11 days, and from a number of surrounding villages, following US-led air strikes and a ground offensive by Kurdish Peshmerga forces. Dressed in traditional Kurdish clothes and speaking in broken Arabic, Othman said: "We can't imagine what life would be like if we had to leave our houses again this time under the threat of the potential collapse of the dam." Inaugurated in 1984 during the era of Saddam Hussein, the dam today is falling into disrepair as a result of neglect over the past 18 months after the Kurds wrested it back from IS. Budget shortfalls due to the slump in oil prices and political rivalry between the central government in Baghdad and the regional government of the semi-autonomous Iraq Kurdistan have hampered urgently needed repairs. There is also a desperate shortage of workers. Half the workforce has left the dam for other jobs on account of not being paid for up to five months. We had special access inside the dam's labyrinth of tunnels to see the urgent problems first-hand. Outdated machinery is still being used to try to stabilise the dam's foundations. The dam's deputy director, Mohsen Yaqoub, showed us samples of soil that had suffered erosion. "These black parts are the treated cement used to inject into the holes and fractures created by the water that constantly eats away at the unstable foundation of the dam," he said. "The dam is today in danger because of the erosion at the natural gypsum base under the water and serious erosion at the flow gates. "The joints at the two main gates have been dislocated vertically and horizontally, which could lead to the collapse of the dam but we don't know when. It could happen next month, next year or in five years' time. We actually don't know when." The Iraqi government has been struggling for more than two years to strike a deal with an international company to undertake the much-needed repair works. Insecurity is scaring away bidders and the economic crisis has forced the oil-rich country to seek help from the World Bank and key allies like the United States. "We just have empty promises from the international community to repair the dam," said Mr Yaqoub, who was previously an engineer at the site for 28 years. "I met the American advisers and took them in a tour inside the dam. They were just nodding at my detailed scientific explanation of the dangers and the efforts made by us to protect the structure." Mosul and other northern cities in the path of the river would be vulnerable if the dam fails. At present, locals say they are not aware of any emergency warning systems to deal with a potential catastrophe in waiting. And if this dam collapsed, it would cause massive devastation to entire communities along the Tigris River. Cities such as Mosul, Tikrit, Samarra and even down to the capital Baghdad are the most vulnerable. Massive floods could kill and render homeless hundreds of thousands, the US state department has warned. Asked what he would do if the dam fails, 22-year-old shepherd Amin Jabouri, who tends his flocks close by, had an immediate response. "We have no other option but to head for a higher ground. Even if there was an alarm system, it would not work for us and we would have to run for our lives."	Othman Mahmoud al-Barazinj is a farmer who has been living in the shadow of Iraq's largest dam ever since the colossal facility was established in the 1980s.
The UK and Ireland are among the countries that can now sell beef to Canada. France and Germany - the EU's biggest producers - are also included. The EU Commission said it was a welcome move, as EU farmers "are going through a particularly difficult period". A Russian import ban and weaker Chinese demand have hit Europe's farm exports. Last month the EU announced a €500m (£365m; $567m) aid package, following many street protests by farmers. The dairy sector has been hit especially hard, with many producers saying current prices are barely enough to cover their costs. The Commission - the EU's top regulator - said Canada's move was "part of a growing trend to recognise the robust, comprehensive and successful measures put in place by the EU to eradicate BSE". The spread of Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in the 1990s - linked to a fatal neurodegenerative disease in humans - led to the mass slaughter of cattle and big losses for beef farmers. The US has also resumed importing beef from the EU, under strict monitoring, a process that began with Ireland in January. Canada has signed a far-reaching free trade agreement with the EU, which is now going through the ratification process.	Canada is reopening its market to beef exports from 19 EU member states, lifting a ban that was imposed in 1996 because of BSE "mad cow disease".
Security consultant Paul Moore examined the publicly available information of the UK's six biggest ISPs. He said he found plenty of bugs that could be exploited by hackers. But he said most ISPs had been in contact with him and had worked to tighten security once told of the issues. The audit of TalkTalk, Sky, BT, Plusnet, EE and Virgin Media was kicked off in the wake of the TalkTalk hack, which saw the personal details of 157,000 of its customers exposed. More than 15,600 bank account number and sort codes were stolen. Similar problems to those encountered by TalkTalk could have been experienced by any of the major ISPs, Mr Moore believes. "There have been a couple of incidents where I had to contact ISPs to report things that were serious," he told the BBC. The audit found a variety of problems, including passwords stored in plain text, exposed code that would allow hackers to inject their own code on to ISPs' websites and, potentially load malware on to them, and issues with encryption certificates that meant Mr Moore could apply for them from the certificate authority and pose as the webmaster for a set of ISP-owned websites. Mr Moore said he was impressed by most of the ISPs's responses when he raised the issues with them. "Ordinarily they would not be so open and honest with me but, after what happened at TalkTalk, they have been stepping in quickly," said Mr Moore. "On one occasion I notified BT and PlusNet about a bug at 14:00 and they kept people back until 22:00 to fix it." But, he added, TalkTalk was yet to contact him. TalkTalk did supply a statement to the BBC saying it had "integrated Paul Moore's comments into an ongoing programme of work". "We constantly run vulnerability checks using industry-standard third party tools. The vulnerability exploited by the hackers was not picked up by this testing, and if it had been, we would clearly have acted on that information straightaway to secure our system," it added. Sky told the BBC: "We take our customers' security very seriously. We constantly review our systems and we have robust, independently assessed protocols in place to make sure customer information is as secure as possible." Prof Alan Woodward, a security expert at Surrey University, said he was shocked by the findings. "TalkTalk still has problems and others have not dissimilar ones," he said. "I find it very surprising that after the TalkTalk hack, they [the six ISPs] still appear not to be attending to the basics. He added: "ISPs are the single biggest handlers of our personal data and I would expect them to get this right."	The security of the UK's biggest internet service providers needs "major improvement", according to one expert.
Sports Direct also reported a big drop in half-year profits, which it blamed partly on the fall in the pound. The retailer, which has been criticised over working conditions, said reported pre-tax profits fell 25% to Â£140.2m. However, the firm added that it would be buying a corporate jet for Â£40m. Chief executive Mike Ashley said the past six months had been "tough for our people and performance". Announcing the company's results, Mr Ashley said: "Our UK sports retail business continues to be the engine of Sports Direct, but our results have been affected by the significant deterioration in exchange rates, and our assessment of our risk relating to our stock levels and European stores performance." Mr Hellawell, who has been under fire during his tenure as chairman, used the results statement to launch a blistering attack on the way in which the company had been treated. "I have no doubt that the extreme political, union and media campaign waged against this company has not only damaged its reputation and influenced our customers, it has impacted negatively on the morale of our people," he said. "I begin to question whether this intense scrutiny is all ethically motivated. One of the most damaging consequences has been for the very people our critics supposedly support. "The board accepts responsibility for our shortcomings, but there has also been disproportionate, inaccurate and misleading commentary. "The individuals at the heart of our organisation are blameless. They are increasingly upset and angry at the barrage of detrimental comments about the company, which in their view is unjustified." Sports Direct has suffered from a number of scandals in recent months. After HMRC looked into whether workers at its Derbyshire warehouse were paid below the minimum wage, a damning report by the the Business, Innovation and Skills committee said employees of the company were "not treated as humans". Since the criticism over its treatment of staff began, a delegation of MPs claimed an attempt was made to record them in a private discussion while on a visit to the firm's Shirebrook warehouse. Most recently, an investigation into the company's accounts was launched. Several senior employees have also left the company. Dave Forsey stepped down as chief executive and was replaced by Mr Ashley. Acting finance director Matt Pearson was replaced by another interim appointment, Herbert Monteith, in October. A subtle sign of the change in mindset at Sports Direct comes deep in the fine print of today's interim results. Under the prim heading "corporate assets and facilities", the company says it is about to take delivery of a corporate plane. Business aircraft are always a potential source of embarrassing headlines, and Sports Direct has had its fair share of those over the last year. But finally it has shown it has learned one of the ways to avoid such headlines - be upfront about what is happening and explain it, and the sting is drawn. Elsewhere, the company's critics were given a few sops. The veteran banker David Brayshaw has been recruited as an independent director, and may perhaps be in line to take over as chairman, should Keith Hellawell, the incumbent, not survive another vote on his tenure on 5 January. Mr Hellawell offered to resign earlier this year, but was convinced not to by Mr Ashley. However, after failing to receive the necessary support from a majority of the company's independent shareholders who voted at the annual general meeting in September, the chairman will stand for re-election on 5 January next year.	Sports Direct chairman Keith Hellawell has lambasted critics of the sportswear firm, saying an "extreme political, union and media campaign" has damaged its reputation.
The LottoNL-Jumbo rider triumphed in a sprint ahead of Australia's Caleb Ewan, with Briton Chris Opie third. That came after several riders fell heavily in a dramatic crash in the final metres in Scarborough. Britain's Adam Blythe also finished in the top 10, placing eighth on the 173km run from Bridlington, the first of three stages. Groenewegen also took narrow victory ahead of Ewan in the opening stage of the 2016 event, eventually won by Thomas Voeckler, who is defending his title this year. "The last climb was hard but the team brought me back into position so I could sprint for the win. It's a beautiful race with a lot of people on the road, that gives you a lot of motivation," he told ITV. "Today was one chance and tomorrow is another but we'll see." Saturday's second stage will start on the bridge in Tadcaster that has been rebuilt after being damaged by floods, and is expected to end in a bunch sprint in Harrogate. Sunday's finale is a gruelling 194.5km ride from Bradford to Sheffield which takes in eight King of the Mountain climbs, including the Cote de Silsden and the cobbles of Haworth's main street, with four ascents saved for a final 22km circuit. The women's race, featuring Britain's former world champion Lizzie Deignan, takes place over the same 122.5km route earlier in the day. The Tour de Yorkshire, now in its third year, began as part of the legacy of the county hosting the 2014 Grand Depart for the Tour de France. Overall classification after stage one: 1. Dylan Groenewegen (Ned/LottoNl-Jumbo) 4hrs 09mins 28secs 2. Caleb Ewan (Aus/Orica-Scott) +4secs 3. Chris Opie (GB/Bike Channel Canyon) +6secs 4. Angel Madrazo (Spa/Delko) +8secs 5.

Adam Blythe (GB/Aqua Blue Sport) Same time 10. Baptiste Planckaer (Bel/Katusha) Same time	Dutchman Dylan Groenewegen claimed the opening stage victory in this year's Tour de Yorkshire.
A leaked document said a group of organisations, also featuring two local NHS trusts, had come together and was the last remaining bidder in the process. The BBC understands it could be led by private firm Interserve. Pending further discussions, the deal is due to be awarded in December. In the leaked document, clinical commissioning groups said the public-private sector consortium would "bring together a wide range of skills and expertise". Discussions are expected to take place over the coming weeks, before an official proposal is submitted. If successful, the consortium will co-ordinate cancer care - from diagnosis through to treatment - in the county. Outsourcing contracts to cover both cancer and end of life care in Staffordshire were announced last year. Together, they are expected to be worth £1.2bn and cover a 10-year period. The contracts will cover the areas controlled by Stafford and Surrounds, Cannock Chase, Stoke-on-Trent and North Staffordshire CCGs. Trade unions have previously described the involvement of private companies as a "huge gamble". Campaigners are expected to hand over a petition on Thursday against awarding the contracts to the private sector.	A £690m cancer care contract in Staffordshire is expected to be awarded to a consortium including private firms.
A third person had been arrested in the raid in Verviers and weapons are reported to have been recovered. Prosecutor Eric Van Der Sypt told reporters police had targeted a group returning from Syria who had been about to launch attacks in a matter of hours. Suspects had opened fire on police, he said. There were also overnight searches in the Brussels area. Speaking after Thursday's raids in Verviers, Mr Van Der Sypt said: "The suspects immediately and for several minutes opened fire with military weaponry and handguns on the special units of the federal police before they were neutralised." After the raid, four Kalashnikovs, bomb-making equipment and police clothing were found, according to local media. Security forces remain in the Verviers area. Anti-terror raids also took place late on Thursday in Brussels and surrounding towns, including Sint-Jans-Molenbeek, Anderlecht and Schaerbeek. Earlier on Thursday two suspected Islamists were arrested in the Brussels suburb of Zaventem, local media reported. Belgian officials say more than 300 people have left Belgium to fight with Islamic militant groups in Syria and Iraq. Belgian journalist Mark Eeckhaut told the BBC the suspects in Verviers had wanted to attack a police station and cause a large number of casualties. The terror threat level in Belgium has been raised to three - the second highest, Mr Van Der Sypt said. Witnesses in Verviers reported hearing heavy gunfire for several minutes and at least three explosions. Witness Marylou Fletcher told the BBC: "We were going back from shopping and saw the police cars. We thought there was an accident then we heard something blowing up. There were a lot of gunshots. "My children cried. They are just terrified." The area around the train station has been cordoned off and reports on social media say there is a heavy police presence in the town centre. Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel later said the security operation "shows the government's determination to fight those who want to spread terror", his spokesman said. British Prime Minister David Cameron said events in Belgium "look like yet another indication of the huge risk we face from Islamist extremist terror in Europe". "We have to remain extremely vigilant, we have to take all the steps we can to beat this evil," he told reporters in Washington where he is to hold talks with President Barack Obama. Verviers is in the province of Liege, close to the German border, and has a population of about 56,000. The incident comes a week after attacks in neighbouring France that killed 17 people. Belgian media has reported that some of the weapons used in those attacks were bought in Brussels. Mr Van Der Sypt said no weapons link with the killings in France had been established. However there are fears that the suspects captured or killed in this operation could have been inspired by the killings in France to accelerate their own plans, the BBC's Chris Morris in Verviers says. The attacks in and around Paris - on satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo, a kosher market and police - have heightened security fears in several European countries. In May last year, four people were killed inside the Jewish museum in Brussels. A Frenchman of Algerian descent is in custody in Belgium over the attack.	Two suspected jihadists have been killed in an anti-terror operation in eastern Belgium, officials say.
Thousands of patients, or their families, will be able to apply to the £380m pot from next month. Those diagnosed after July 2012 and who cannot sue former employers as they have gone bust or insurance details have disappeared will be eligible. Ministers said the move ended "years of injustice". Mesothelioma can take decades to develop, but when symptoms emerge it progresses rapidly. Most die within three years of being diagnosed. Around 2,000 people are diagnosed each year, and the numbers are set to increase over the next 30 years, with an estimated death toll of between 56,000 and 63,000, according to the Department for Work and Pensions. The cancer is most prevalent among those who worked in industries with heavy exposure to asbestos up to the 1980s, including construction, shipbuilding, engineering and power generation. Until now, victims and their families have been able to claim damages under two pieces of legislation but the sums paid have not generally exceeded £20,000. The new fund will entitle UK claimants to 80% of the average settlement paid out in civil actions relating to mesothelioma, meaning payments will range from £115,000 to £123,000. On top of the payment, the fund will pay out £7,000 towards legal costs. The Mesothelioma Act was passed in January and allowed the creation of the compensation pot, funded by the insurance industry. Those diagnosed before the scheme was first announced, on 25 July 2012, will not be eligible. Claimants will have to demonstrate that they were negligently exposed to asbestos at work and are unable to claim compensation because they cannot track down a liable employer or insurer. Work and Pensions Minister Mike Penning said: "This will end years of injustice for mesothelioma victims and their families - who have had to endure this terrible disease with little hope of any compensation from the insurance industry. "We have made it an absolute priority to bring in the scheme as soon as legislation will allow, so I am pleased to announce that victims will be able to apply for payments from next month." According to government calculations, around 3,500 patients or their dependants are likely to be eligible for support. Dr John Moore-Gillon, honorary medical adviser at the British Lung Foundation, said: "Mesothelioma is a particularly devastating disease, killing over 2,400 people every year in the UK, most of whom were innocently exposed to asbestos in the work place. "The government's announcement today is therefore a positive move for mesothelioma patients and their families, many of whom struggled to gain any compensation at all until recently. "What we urgently need to see now is greater commitment to funding research into new treatments for mesothelioma." He added: "Although compensation awards are very helpful, they don't change the fact that most people who develop mesothelioma will be dead in less than three years. "Only research investment will change that - it is what patients and their families want, and with over 50,000 likely to die of the disease in the UK within the next 30 years, it is something we desperately need to prioritise."	Victims of mesothelioma, an aggressive cancer caused by exposure to asbestos, are to receive an average of £123,000 compensation from a new fund.
Programme makers did not disclose the comments made by Biggins, who had been the bookmakers' favourite to win. But they said the Channel 5 show "does not tolerate offensive language". Biggins, 67, had sparked controversy four days earlier over comments that bisexual people were "the worst type". Opening Friday's live show - which saw presenter Anthea Turner's ex-husband Grant Bovey voted out of the house - presenter Emma Willis made brief reference to Biggins' removal but gave no details. A statement posted on the Celebrity Big Brother website said the show had "taken the decision to remove Christopher Biggins". "Since entering Big Brother, he has made a number of comments capable of causing great offence to housemates and the viewing public," it said. "Big Brother does not tolerate offensive language capable of causing widespread offence." During a conversation about homosexuality earlier this week, the openly gay star said: "The worst type though is, I'm afraid to say, the bisexuals... what it is is people not wanting to admit they are gay." He was then seen agreeing with fellow contestant Renee Graziano's comment that "You have to pick a team". The programme's producers have not said whether these comments were among those that they considered before ordering Biggins to leave the house. Two of the other housemates have received official warnings from Big Brother over their behaviour in the show's first week. US singer Aubrey O'Day was warned for spitting in reality TV star Stephen Bear's sandwich. Bear himself received a warning after throwing a mug, which smashed a glass window, following a row with Heavy D from the TV show Storage Hunters. Biggins won ITV show I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here! in 2007. The other contestants on this year's Celebrity Big Brother are: Renee Graziano of TV's Mob Wives; former X Factor contestants Chloe Khan and Katie Waissel; US actor Frankie Grande; reality TV stars Lewis Bloor and Marnie Simpson, former EastEnders actor Ricky Norwood; Loose Women presenter Saira Khan, and former model Samantha Fox.	Actor Christopher Biggins has been removed from the Celebrity Big Brother house for making "a number of comments capable of causing great offence", the reality TV show has said.
The FTSE 100 index rose 77 points, or 1.1%, to 6,911.4, with similar rises seen elsewhere in Europe. Most analysts had expected the Fed to hold rates on Wednesday, although the US central bank indicated rates could rise before the end of the year. The dollar fell after US rates were held, which pushed commodity prices up. That led to rises in shares of mining companies, as the price of copper hit a one-month high and other metal prices increased. Shares in Glencore and Fresnillo led the FTSE 100 higher, with both seeing rises of more than 5%. "Given the rise across the spectrum for commodities, it comes as no surprise that the FTSE leaderboard is headed by some of the biggest names in mining," said Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG. In the FTSE 250, shares in Kier Group rose 1.3% after the construction group reported a 45% increase in underlying full-year pre-tax profits to Â£125m. On the currency markets, the pound rose 0.55% against the dollar to $1.3104, but was little changed against the euro at â‚¬1.166.	(Close): UK shares joined in the global rally triggered by the US Federal Reserve's decision to keep interest rates unchanged.
Uefa's executive will not allow their congress to discuss Jersey's bid as the island is not recognised by the United Nations as an independent nation. Representatives from Uefa visited the island, which is a crown dependency of Great Britain, in September to meet with Jersey football officials. "This was the response we expected," said Jersey FA president Phil Austin. "From a footballing perspective we more than meet the criteria. "In rejecting our application, the executive of Uefa have said that they're not putting our application forward to the congress. We don't think the executive have the authority to do that, we think it should go to congress," Austin told BBC Sport. Jersey submitted a bid to leave the English FA and join Uefa in December 2015, following the acceptance of Gibraltar and Kosovo, who are not independent nations. But Gibraltar's initial application in 2007 came before the rules were changed, while Kosovo, who joined Uefa in May and played in their first World Cup qualifier in September declared independence from Serbia in 2008. "I have no idea how long it's going to take, we are waiting for a court date hopefully within the next six months, but I don't know," added Austin. "We are watching the costs very carefully and we will take it each step at a time and managed our budget accordingly. "One or two people have stepped forward who believe in what we're doing and will help us with our funding."	Jersey are to appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) after their bid to join Uefa was turned down.
The assets comprise properties, money from nearly 30 bank accounts and fine art belonging to Gioacchino Campolo. Dubbed the King of Videopoker, as he made his fortune by tampering with slot machines, Campolo was sentenced last year to 18 years in prison. Authorities have described the seizure as the largest ever from a criminal in Italian history. Campolo came by his fortune by altering slot machines in countless bars and cafes. In 2011, he was found guily of criminal association, usury and extortion. For 10 years he tampered with gambling machines, amassing millions in illegal profits, the BBC's Alan Johnston in Rome reports. Among the confiscated assets are more than 200 properties comprising homes, shops and land in Rome, Milan and Paris among other cities. Campolo also possessed more than 100 art works, including an original Salvador Dali. They are all now state property. The Italian fraudster is thought to have had strong links with one of the most powerful mafia networks in the southern region of Calabria, known as the 'Ndrangheta. Authorities say the criminal network helped him amass his fortune in return for sharing some of his profits. Italian police have hailed the assets seizure as a defining moment in its war against criminal networks. A police statement said that "taking on criminal fortunes means taking away prestige from the 'Ndrangheta within its own criminal environment". The 'Ndrangheta is estimated to have an annual turnover of tens of billions of euros, the AFP news agency reports. But, in 2010, the 'Ndrangheta suffered a major blow when police arrested more than 300 people suspected of belonging to the network following a sophisticated undercover operation.	Italian police have seized assets estimated to be worth about 330m euros (£253m) from a convicted businessman.
GB Taekwondo have overlooked the world number one three times in favour of Muhammad, ranked 59th in the world. The move has been investigated by the BOA and, while they feel selectors acted properly, they were disappointed by the way the issue has been handled. "There are two world-class athletes directly impacted by this nomination," read a statement issued by the BOA. "Our panel would have preferred to see the selection process managed in a manner that would have been of much greater service to both athletes. Overturning the selection made by a national federation would have been an unprecedented decision for the BOA. They asked GB Taekwondo to reconsider their choice of Lutalo Muhammad and the governing body returned with the same name, and, satisfied that proper selection procedures had been followed, the BOA didn't have much choice. That doesn't mean they're happy. They say they might revisit the matter should the international federation's investigation bring new issues to the fore. They're aware of the pressure this has put on both athletes and have criticised the apparent lack of transparency that has made GB Taekwondo's decision to leave out the world number one hard to understand. "That said, after a thorough review, the panel is now sufficiently satisfied that the agreed selection procedures have been followed, and it is on that basis we are ratifying the nomination." GB Taekwondo welcomed the BOA decision. Performance director Gary Hall said: "This has been a long and difficult process for all involved, for the selection panel members and particularly for the two athletes concerned. Both are outstanding candidates and truly world class, both capable of winning medals in London. This has been the most difficult of selection decisions." Cook's camp is now considering whether to launch legal action. "Aaron is naturally incredibly disappointed with the BOA decision," said his agent Jamie Cunningham. "He should be competing in the 2012 Games. It is an absolute disgrace that a British world number one has not been selected for the London Olympics by either his governing body or Olympic Association. "He is world number one, European champion and has beaten 10 of the top 15 athletes in the Olympic rankings in his most recent fights. What more could Aaron have done? "We urge the World Taekwondo Federation to consider the ramifications of this flawed decision. Aaron will be considering whether he wishes to pursue a legal route to contest this decision over the weekend." Bob Mitchell, solicitor at Harbottle & Lewis representing Aaron Cook, added: "Everyone is extremely disappointed by the outcome today. We have retained a leading sports QC and will be deciding over the weekend what the best way is to proceed for Aaron from a legal and sports perspective. A further statement is likely to be issued early next week." The BOA's Olympic Qualification Standards panel can only accept or reject athlete nominations - it is not within its remit to select individual athletes. However, the BOA noted the importance of working closer with national governing bodies over selection policies for future Games. The panel added it reserves the right to reconsider the nomination subject to an ongoing inquiry by the World Taekwondo Federation.	The British Olympic Association has ratified Lutalo Muhammad's nomination for London 2012 ahead of Aaron Cook.
Koukash has owned the Super League team since 2013 but it has stated before he could leave Salford. "My plans are to make sure we win the next few games. We'll see what happens at the end of the season," he said. "I have not made my mind up to walk away, I'm working hard to make sure it is financially viable for next year." Salford scored 13 tries as they comfortably beat Featherstone on Sunday in a game where only 1,759 were in attendance at the AJ Bell Stadium. "It was a crucial game, there was no football around, there was good weather, it's a Sunday where families can come and we reduced ticket prices," Koukash told BBC Radio Manchester. "To only have 1,750 for a crucial game, I must say I'm very disappointed. What the fans all have to understand is that next year the club will only be able to spend what it can afford. "I can no longer keep bankrolling it the way I did. If the fans wanted to see a competitive Super League side they need to start turning up." Despite his future with the club being in doubt, Koukash said he could not buy another rugby league club if his time with Salford was to end. "Once you are a Red Devil, you will always be a Red Devil. I will never be involved with another club, that's it. The time when I finish from Salford, I will just sit back and enjoy the sport like any other fan," he added.	Salford Red Devils owner Marwan Koukash says he has still not decided whether he will sell the club at the end of the current season.
The response from many in that time has been: "Let's get on with it." That view was shared by the First Minister Carwyn Jones until recently when he altered his opinion and said that we should only start the official Brexit negotiations in the early part of next year. My sense is that the public will be flexible on the timing up to a point, as long as they are given a clear sense of direction. The majority of the political establishment have had to come to terms with the fact that most people ignored their advice to remain. So much for being in touch with the electorate. In conversations with politicians on the remain side since, I have come across a mix of bewilderment, frustration and sadness. And while people like me spend a lot of time talking and writing about a Welsh political dynamic, on this subject at least, Wales was a carbon copy of England. In stark contrast, those that supported leaving feel vindicated by their campaign, and now believe they are the ones in touch with vast swathes of the population. The referendum result was a devastating indictment of the effectiveness of the billions of pounds of EU funds spent trying to regenerate economically deprived communities. The brutal reality is that those who were most likely to vote to leave lived in communities where most EU money had been spent. It is an extraordinary paradox that raised eyebrows far further afield than Wales. The early stages of a debate about replacement funding has got under way. The Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns, a Remain campaigner, led the way by wasting no time in calling for a fundamental change in approach. Brexit means the Wales Office may have been given a new sense of purpose, and no more so than in regeneration funding. There's been little meat on the bone but his fundamental premise is that everything has to change, and simply writing a Westminster cheque rather than a Brussels cheque will not cut it. The early signs are that the Wales Office would like to play a part redesigning a new funding system. This will not go down well with the Welsh Government but the come-back from Westminster will be that officials in Cardiff have not done a good job spending the money. There will be something just as fundamental going on regarding financial support for the farming industry. This is a devolved matter so the Welsh Government will have a far stronger sense of entitlement to owning any new system that is introduced. So far there have been plenty of warm words about being in listening mode but not much in terms of concrete proposals, or even ideas, about how to create a new system of agricultural subsidies. And finally, what about the Welsh economy? Those who express concern about the impact of Brexit are criticised by Leave campaigners for creating a self-fulfilling prophecy. When the chairman of the Welsh Conservatives, Jonathan Evans, a fiercely pro-European politician, talked openly to me about recession, there were a number from within his own party who were deeply unhappy at the tone. But how do you then deal with the facts of the matter regarding things like inward investment, when most companies have come to Wales because of our membership of the single market? That was the elephant in the room when the Welsh Government's Economy Secretary Ken Skates spoke about a renewed focus on promoting Wales abroad in light of the Brexit. It is a huge hurdle to overcome, and something that will depend on the effectiveness of the trade deals that Brexiteers like Boris Johnson and Liam Fox will now have to strike with countries around the world. At the same time, there are strong indicators in the Welsh economy, with a continued trend on unemployment in Wales which is remarkable. The norm has been for a number of months that the rate in Wales is lower than the UK average, reversing years of it being the other way round. The underlying strength of the Welsh economy will be tested in the months ahead with the inevitable uncertainty that will accompany the start of negotiations.	It has been a month since Wales voted to leave the European Union.
If found guilty on the charge of negligence, she could be jailed for up to 10 years. The anti-corruption agency has also called for her to be personally liable for losses to state coffers. Ms Yingluck was removed by a court in May 2014, shortly before the military ousted her elected government. She was later impeached over the rice subsidy scheme and banned from politics for five years. Thailand, meanwhile, remains under martial law in the wake of the coup. Ms Yingluck was not at Bangkok's Supreme Court to hear the indictment. But the BBC's Jonathan Head in Bangkok says today's court filing will seem to her supporters like yet another attempt by the military to crush her politically for whenever Thailand does return to democratic rule. Under the rice subsidy scheme Ms Yingluck's Pheu Thai-led government bought rice from Thai farmers at above the market rate, costing the government billions of dollars. Critics accused Ms Yingluck of funnelling money to her core supporters. She said the policy was aimed at helping farmers and denied any day-to-day involvement in the running of the scheme. The Supreme Court will decide on 19 March whether to pursue the criminal case. Additionally, Finance Minister Sommai Phasee said on Wednesday that the ministry had received a letter from the national corruption watchdog urging it to pursue civil suit against Ms Yingluck to recover losses of 600bn baht ($18.4bn; Â£11.9bn) related to the scheme. "The finance ministry oversees damages to the state and is ready to take action," he said. The military seized power in May 2014 in what it said was a bid to restore public order after months of occasionally violent street protests against Ms Yingluck's government. But Thailand has been embroiled in a cycle of political instability since the military ousted Ms Yingluck's brother, billionaire Thaksin Shinawatra, as prime minister in 2006. The Shinawatra family are hugely popular among Thailand's rural population but are hated by the urban middle-class and elite who accuse them of corruption. Thaksin-linked parties, under various different names, have won every election since 2001.	Thailand's attorney-general has filed criminal charges against former Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra over a controversial rice subsidy scheme.
Taylor, 27, retired with a heart condition in April 2016 after seven England Tests and 27 one-day games. He has since worked with Nottinghamshire and Yorkshire's academies in addition to media work. "It's great to see his desire to still be involved with the game," head coach David Ripley said of Taylor's arrival. "James has a fantastic 50-over record, averaging over 50 which is obviously outstanding. "I believe he can offer good advice and relay his one-day cricket experiences on to our batsmen." Meanwhile, former Northants captain Sales, who scored in excess of 22,000 runs in more than 20 years at the County Ground before his retirement in 2014, will work with the county's batsmen. "David has been working part time with the batters since January, focusing on improving more of the technical aspects of their game," Ripley added. "I believe his cricket brain and experience are a real positive for the squad and will go a long way to improving their overall game."	Former England batsman James Taylor has joined Northamptonshire as a coaching consultant, while David Sales has taken a part-time coaching role.
Rajab, who heads the Bahrain Centre for Human Rights (BCHR), was convicted in 2012 of taking part in illegal gatherings and disturbing public order. An appeals court later reduced his original three-year term by a year. He was one of several leading activists arrested by the authorities after pro-democracy protests erupted in 2011. Soon after his release on Saturday, Rajab told the Associated Press news agency that he was happy to be out after spending more than 600 days in prison. He also appealed for the release of all political prisoners, the agency added. Rights groups, including Amnesty International and Human Rights First, have campaigned on behalf of Rajab throughout his prison sentence, calling on the authorities to release him. In December 2013, a Bahraini court rejected a request by Rajab's lawyers for early release. They argued that he was eligible because he had already served three-quarters of a two-year sentence. In addition to his role with the BCHR, Mr Rajab is deputy secretary general of the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH). Before his imprisonment in July 2012, Mr Rajab was repeatedly detained in connection with the pro-democracy protests that erupted in the Gulf kingdom the previous year. Amnesty said that he was punched in the face several times by riot police as he led a demonstration in February 2012, and in May 2012 was charged with "insulting a national institution" in comments about the interior ministry he posted on Twitter. In June 2012, Rajab was sentenced to three months in jail over different tweets he wrote about the prime minister. The conviction was eventually overturned on appeal, but only after he had begun his two-year sentence for taking part in unauthorised protests. At his trial, Mr Rajab told the court that he had been held in dire conditions and subjected to ill treatment, including being placed in solitary confinement with a dead animal and kept almost naked. BCHR's founder, Abdulhadi al-Khawaja, is serving a life sentence for allegedly plotting to overthrow the government. He was convicted on evidence that was widely accepted as having been secured under torture.	Prominent Bahraini human rights activist Nabeel Rajab has been freed after serving two years in prison for his involvement in illegal protests.
For most of US history, party nominees have been decided by political power brokers and deal-makers behind closed doors. Parties operate like private clubs - they make their own rules and are suspicious of outsiders. Only in recent history has a more open system of primaries and caucuses been grafted onto the process to give the average American a say in who appears on the general election ballot. In a close, contentious primary season, however, the veneer of accountability can rub off, exposing the sometimes unsightly gears that still power the US political system. This has prompted objection from the supporters of two candidates in particular - Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders - who feel that the party establishments are arrayed against their presidential quests. But are their concerns valid? Here are answers to four pertinent questions as the nomination battles approach its final months. 34 Number of delegates Ted Cruz received in Colorado, which held conventions to pick delegates 759 Trump total delegate count 529 Cruz total delegate count Mr Trump is leading the race for the Republican nomination, but it's starting to feel like he's not winning. While he's comfortably ahead, with 757 delegates to 529 for second-place Ted Cruz, there's mounting evidence that he's being outmanoeuvred in the behind-the-scenes political process that could come into play if he doesn't reach the magic 1,237 delegate number necessary to secure the nomination outright. In Colorado - which selected its delegates at party gatherings last week and not through primaries or caucuses - Mr Cruz walked away with all 34 delegates. Even in states that have held contests won by Mr Trump, Mr Cruz's team has been working doggedly to ensure that their people become delegates. While Mr Trump swept South Carolina's 50 delegates, for instance, the state's convention delegation will be riddled with Cruz supporters who, while bound to Mr Trump on the first few ballots, can switch to the Texas senator if there is a protracted convention battle. It has Mr Trump and his people crying foul. "This is happening all over our country - great people being disenfranchised by politicians," Mr Trump tweeted on Monday. "Repub party is in trouble!" Paul Manafort, Mr Trump's new aide in charge of managing the delegate-selection process, accused the Cruz campaign of using "Gestapo tactics, scorched-earth tactics" in Colorado. If, as Mr Trump asserted on Monday, the system is "rigged" and "crooked", however, it isn't always tilted in favour of Mr Trump's opponents. Thanks to the Republican Party's delegate-apportioning system, including Florida's winner-take-all primary, Mr Trump has secured a larger share of the delegates so far (45%) than he has of the raw primary vote (37%). If Mr Cruz manages to win the nomination at the Republican convention despite trailing Mr Trump in total delegates and share of the popular vote, Mr Trump may have reason to feel aggrieved. But before he complains too loudly, he might want to heed some sage advice attributed (incorrectly) to Albert Einstein: "You have to learn the rules of the game. And then you have to play better than anyone else." Mr Trump should be familiar with the quote, since he tweeted it in October 2014. 17 States Bernie Sanders has won 18 States Hillary Clinton has won Mr Sanders has won five state contests in a row and seven of the last eight. If he were an American football team he'd be poised for the playoffs. If he were prize fighter, he'd be tuning up for a title bout. Instead his pledged-delegate deficit to Mrs Clinton has gone from daunting to only fractionally less daunting. Over the course of his recent run, the Vermont Senator has picked up a net of just 91 delegates, despite winning Wisconsin 56% to 43%, Utah 79% to 20% and Washington 72% to 27%. According to a New York Times calculation, the former secretary of state currently has 1,305 pledged delegates, while Sanders stands at 1,086. Add in the non-binding support of "super-delegates" - Democratic officeholders and party functionaries who also cast ballots for the nominee at the convention - and Mrs Clinton's lead balloons to 1,774 to 1,117. To secure the Democratic nomination without drama at the convention a candidate needs the backing of 2,383 delegates The problem for Mr Sanders is that while he's been posting sizeable wins over the past month, they've largely been in delegate-poor states, like Wyoming (14 delegates), Idaho (23) and Alaska (16). His successes pale when compared to Mrs Clinton's massive earlier wins in populous southern states like Texas, Florida and Georgia, which alone netted her 184 delegates over Mr Sanders. If Mrs Clinton performs as expected in the coming contests in New York (291 delegates), Maryland (118) and Pennsylvania (210), she'll largely erase all the modest ground Mr Sanders made up over the past three weeks. 9,412,426 Votes for Hillary Clinton during primary season so far 7,034,997 Votes for Bernie Sanders during primary season so far If delegate maths and selection rules make your head hurt, at least we can rely on the raw vote totals to get a feel for how popular the remaining candidates are, right? Wrong. According to current tabulations Hillary Clinton has received 9,412,426 votes during the primary season so far. Bernie Sanders has received 7,034,997. That 2.4m vote lead has been relentlessly touted by the former secretary of state and her supporters to counter the claims of Sanders faithful that their man is more popular than the delegate tallies indicate. Some states that hold caucuses - like Iowa and Washington - aren't included in that number, however, because they don't report vote totals. The Washington Post's Glenn Kessler tried to extrapolate numbers for the remaining states based on their total voter turnout and concluded that Hillary Clinton leads Bernie Sanders by 2.3m votes  - still a significant margin. Among the Republicans, who are better about providing full vote totals, Mr Trump leads with 8,256,309 votes. Mr Cruz is second (6,319,244), former candidate Marco Rubio is third (3,482,129), followed by Mr Kasich (2,979,379). In the end the popular vote may give the leading candidates a claim of legitimacy as the people's choice - but appearances can be deceiving. "The media has created the perception that the voters choose the nomination. That's the conflict here," North Dakota delegate Curly Haugland told a television interviewer. "The rules are still designed to have a political party choose its nominee at a convention. That's just the way it is." "Well, there's the law, and then there's ethics, and then there's getting votes. I'm not going to get into what tactics are used." If, as appears to be increasingly likely, the Republican primary season ends without Donald Trump securing the 1,237 delegates needed to secure the nomination, the Republican National Convention could turn into a political free-for-all unrivalled in modern US political history. After several rounds of deadlocked balloting, most convention delegates would be free to vote their conscience. But could that conscience be nudged by, say, a free weekend at a Donald Trump golf resort, a nice dinner with the Cruz family or even a choice spot in a John Kasich administration? Maybe! While there are detailed anti-corruption laws governing the behaviour of public officeholders, convention delegates are private citizens. While government regulations prohibit them from taking money from corporations, labour unions, government contractors or foreign nationals, the law beyond that is much murkier. Campaigns and their wealth donors could likely cover delegate travel expenses, no matter how lavish. Gold watches? Bags of small, unmarked bills? Who knows? State anti-bribery laws may apply, but there's scant legal precedent. Perhaps the greatest deterrent to untoward action by campaigns is the negative publicity such naked attempts at influence could have if they're documented. But public perceptions and attitudes this political season has been difficult to predict, to say the least. Although the national convention is still months away, accusations of dirty tricks have already started flying. On Sunday Mr Trump took to Twitter to accuse the Cruz campaign of misdeeds during the South Carolina state party convention - a charge Mr Cruz vehemently denied. "I win a state in votes and then get non-representative delegates because they are offered all sorts of goodies by Cruz campaign," Mr Trump wrote. "Bad system!" During a television interview that same morning, however, Trump adviser Paul Manafort appeared to acknowledge that his campaign won't be shy in wooing delegates at the national convention, however. "Well, there's the law, and then there's ethics, and then there's getting votes," he said. "I'm not going to get into what tactics are used. I happen to think the best way we're going to get delegates is to have Donald Trump be exposed to delegates, let the delegates hear what he says." Another Trump adviser, Barry Bennett, said they wouldn't be offering "seats on the Trump airplane or anything like that". "There's obviously a big line - we're not going to do anything immoral, illegal or unethical," he said. But when a presidential nomination is at stake, and it comes down to just a handful of delegates, that "big line" may end up looking awfully fuzzy.	The United States may be a democracy, but the party presidential nomination process - upon closer inspection - is hardly a shining beacon of democratic light.
The number of pedestrians and cyclists hurt in accidents fell by more than a third between 2012 and 2016 - but the rate was lower in 20mph zones, the city council said. The council said it will now evaluate the effectiveness of existing zones. It also agreed to spend the Â£687,000 road safety pot on alternative schemes. Since 2014, a 20mph limit has been introduced on more than 1,000 roads and around 138 schools in the city. This has cost the council about Â£640,000, according to a BBC Freedom of Information request. It led to an average speed reduction of 0.7mph in these areas but the "amount of accidents experienced in 20mph zones has not fallen as quickly as initially hoped", the council said. For example, casualties of cyclists on the city's roads fell by more than 40% between 2012 and 2016 but the drop in 20mph zones was notably lower - 16% in Gorton and 12% in Miles Platting, Newton Heath, Moss Side and Fallowfield. Last year, one person in Greater Manchester was convicted for exceeding the speed limit in a 20mph zone, police said. While the review is undertaken, money for road safety will be spent on other traffic calming measures and pedestrian crossings. Councillor Rosa Battle said: "It's important that we fully understand how effective these zones have been in terms of reducing accidents so far." Rod King, director of 20's Plenty for Us, welcomed the report but said it was "incorrect to use early, small number datasets which are not statistically valid and compare them to whole city totals".	A plan to expand 20mph zones across Manchester is to be reviewed after their impact on reducing the number of accidents was called into question.
The firm announced it had switched on its service in 130 additional countries. It said it was still trying to expand to China. The other exceptions are North Korea, Syria and Crimea, where it is banned from operating by US law. The announcement was made by the firm's chief executive Reed Hastings at his keynote speech at the CES tech show in Las Vegas. He also confirmed that Netflix would begin offering HDR (high dynamic range) content later this year. The company's shares closed the day more than 9% higher. "We were expecting Netflix to go everywhere, but this has happened more quickly than we thought," commented Fernando Elizalde from the tech consultancy Gartner. "Until now, the firm had been doing it in phased stages because of the costs of marketing and dubbing or subtitling the content. "But it's worth remembering that in some of the emerging economies it will only be people in urban areas that will be able to use it because of limited internet availability." Mr Hastings said Netflix was in talks with the Chinese government, but acknowledged it would take time to reach an agreement. "It's a very large country, you know a billion Chinese that we want to give access to the Netflix content," he said. "In China you need specific permission from the government to operate, so we are continuing to work on that and we are very patient." But one company watcher had doubts. "China is going to be a tough nut to crack given that that three strong domestic services already exist," said Mike Goodman from Strategy Analytics. As part of its expansion, Netflix has added support for Korean, Chinese and Arabic to its list of supported languages. That brings the total number - in which the firm provides subtitles, captions and alternative audio - to 21 languages. Mr Hastings added that Netflix would initially focus on expanding the reach of its existing content rather than commissioning extra locally-made shows. For consumers who already have Netflix, the biggest change may be the addition of HDR. High dynamic range video allows compatible TVs to show millions more colours and a wider dynamic range - added shades of brightness in between black and white - letting more detail be shown. Many experts believe the impact is greater than that of just jumping from 1080p to 4K ultra-high definition resolution alone. One consequence of using the format, however, is that it requires more data, and few TVs support it yet. Mr Hastings said users with compatible TVs should get a "visceral sensation that's pretty amazing". The firm's rival, Amazon, began streaming a limited number of shows in the format in 2015. Audience members at the Las Vegas event were also given a first look at some of the service's forthcoming shows, including: Ironically, the clips were blocked for those watching a live stream of the event. The firm also teased Chelsea Does..., a documentary series presented by the comedian Chelsea Handler that will cover topics including drugs, racism, marriage and Silicon Valley. In addition, it announced Ricky Gervais was directing and starring in a film called Special Correspondents about a journalist who broadcasts fake war reports, which will be added to its library in April. Mr Hastings also revealed some fresh statistics about the service. He said it now served a total of 125 million hours a day of entertainment to its viewers, and had streamed 12 billion hours-worth of video over the final three months of 2015, which is nearly 50% up on the same period in 2014.

Evidence of suspected match-fixing in elite tennis was revealed this week by a BBC and BuzzFeed News investigation. "Future players will see the headlines and see it's not an option at all," doubles representative Fleming told BBC Scotland on Wednesday. "I think if anyone is found to be doing it, that should be them. They shouldn't be playing again." Fleming, 31, and his partner Jonathan Erlich, were beaten 6-4, 3-6, 6-3 in the first round of the Australian Open on Wednesday by Robin Haase and Fernando Verdasco. "The key thing about sport is that it's pure, you don't know the outcome of any given match, and that's what people pay to come and watch," he added. "You never know what's going to happen. That's key  and they have to preserve that. "I've never been approached to take money or anything to fix a match or lose a match. It does go on because people have been banned at lower levels. I'm surprised to see the article come out and talk about higher levels; I certainly haven't been aware of anything going on there." The Scot said he had no idea as to the identity of the suspected match-fixers, and suggested additional funding could be granted to the Tennis Integrity Unit (TIU), set-up to police the sport. "Your guess is as good as mine," he said of those involved. "There were no names in the article because it's very difficult to prove anything. I think that's the issue the TIU has in that a match can be reported or look suspicious, but it doesn't necessarily mean players are guilty. "It can just be people throwing money on a match." Fleming was adamant, though, that no such activities were occurring in Melbourne. "I think if you're sitting at home or buying a ticket to come and watch here at the Aussie Open, I've no doubt in my mind you're watching pure sporting theatre," he said. "Players going at it and the best player winning on that day. There's no doubt in my mind that is the case here."	Great Britain's Colin Fleming says tennis players guilty of match-fixing should face life bans.
Walter Innes and fellow Shorewatch volunteer Monika Carrie were about to head home after an eventful day "staring at an empty sea" on Tuesday. They then spotted what looked like a dolphin feeding frenzy and Mr Innes took a picture, believing it to be of a dolphin taking a large salmon. Expert Charlie Phillips said such attacks were not completely understood. Mr Innes took his picture at 18:04 on Tuesday just outside the south breakwater at Aberdeen Harbour. He said: "Monika Carrie and I had been staring at an empty sea for a while and were just about to leave. "We saw what we thought at first was a feeding frenzy, and went down on the rocks to try and get pictures. I thought it was a very large salmon, until I got home and saw it on the computer screen. "You hear and read about this behaviour, but to see it on the doorstep is stunning." Mr Phillips, a Highlands-based Whale and Dolphin Conservation field officer who monitors the Moray Firth's resident population of bottlenose dolphins, said: "It's not completely understood why some bottlenose dolphins attack harbour porpoise like this. "The example in Walter's great pictures show that it's normally small porpoise, often calves, that seem to be targeted. "One day we might have a better understanding of this behaviour but until then we can only make guesses or speculation." Mr Phillips added: "It does happen frequently, as the pathologists at the whale and dolphin strandings department of Scotland's Rural College have carcasses of porpoise showing clear signs of bottlenose attack to examine, and they are massive injuries that have been sustained."	A whale and dolphin-watcher has photographed an attack by a bottlenose dolphin on a porpoise off Aberdeen.
Lara Clarke, an amateur baker from the West Midlands, has baked this special Harry Potter cake. In the past she has also baked the Weasley's flying car and the Hogwart's library. Many other bakers around the world have also made cakes to celebrate JK Rowling's special day.	The author of the Harry Potter books, JK Rowling, is celebrating her 50th birthday today.
The retailer has been under fire over zero hours contracts and disclosure that staff at a warehouse were paid less than the minimum wage. Independent shareholders had called for changes to the way the company was run. Sources told the BBC that Mr Forsey was "not coerced", and that Mr Ashley is a permanent replacement, not temporary. The billionaire businessman has given up his role as executive deputy chairman. BBC business correspondent Joe Lynam said sources told him that the shake-up was not part of a plan to take Sports Direct private. There has been speculation that, following months of criticism of the company, Mr Ashley wanted to remove Sports Direct from the stock market. Mr Ashley, who owns more than 50% of the company, said in a statement: "I feel like I have lost my right arm, but I do hope to have the opportunity to work with Dave again in the future." Mr Forsey has worked for the retailer for 32 years after starting as a part-time worker when he was 18. Earlier this year he agreed to forgo a £3.7m share award in recognition of the problems at the company. Mr Forsey said: "I have given my entire working life to the company and in return the company has given me amazing opportunities and experiences." Sports Direct's board made two other changes, promoting Karen Byers to the role of global head of operations, and Sean Nevitt to the role of global head of commercial. Amid criticism over Sports Direct's working practices and bad publicity, there had been calls by shareholders for the removal of chairman Keith Hellawell. The company, which has around 450 retail outlets, came under the spotlight after an investigation uncovered that staff were kept on site at its giant Shirebrook warehouse in Derbyshire after their shifts for body searches. These took so long that their pay effectively dipped below the minimum wage. Mr Ashley, Sports Direct's billionaire founder, was called to answer questions from MPs, who compared working practices at the warehouse with "that of a Victorian workhouse than that of a modern High Street retailer". In the wake of that, the sportswear chain's lawyers produced a critical report of its working conditions. The company was criticised for its use of zero hours contracts. It says it will offer workers who want them guaranteed hours. It also said it would put a worker on the board. That report also criticised Mr Forsey for failing to inform the Sports Direct board about some of the issues at Shirebrook. But calls for an independent review continued and earlier this week, Sports Direct said it would authorise such a study of working practices and corporate governance, following concerns raised by shareholders. Mr Ashley denied knowing much about the way Shirebrook operated, telling the BBC: "You'd be surprised how little I knew of what was going on." Like so many in the company's hierarchy, Karen Byers, Sports Direct's new global head of operations met founder Mike Ashley informally and has known him a very long time. She's been with the company for more than 20 years and it is said she got the job after trying to sell Mike Ashley a pair of jeans. Despite being head of retail at a publicly-listed retail giant with 30,000 employees for much at that time, she's very low profile indeed. Earlier this year Mike Ashley himself singled her out in a rare interview he gave to the Times newspaper: "Karen Byers runs Sports Direct. She runs the retail, all the money comes out the retail, [the warehouse workers and store managers] are her army. She is the person who sets the rules. Not me." One investment analyst firm said she was well regarded inside the company and out. The same firm though said she was not known for her "flowery or evasive approach". Just like her boss. Paul Blomfield, a member of the Business Innovation and Skills committee which grilled Mike Ashley in June, is not convinced by the changes: "What our committee wanted to happen was for the company to seriously address what was, not just problems around the edges, but systemic labour exploitation in the workplace. And whether Mr Ashley is the person to do that - given the evidence he gave to our committee - is yet to be seen." Mike Fox, from shareholder Royal London Asset Management, wasn't impressed with Friday's board changes either: "The installation of Mike Ashley as chief executive, consolidating his influence at the top of the business, is unlikely to reassure anyone." He said the way the company was run had long been a problem and that Sports Direct still needed a new chairman before it could rebuild trust with investors. Sarah Wilson, chief executive of shareholder pressure group, Manifest, told BBC Radio 5 live the move added another corporate governance problem: "Are we going to see [Mike Ashley] step down from his other job as deputy chairman? "Had Mike Ashley listened to shareholders four or five years ago, we might not be in the situation we're in at the moment." She said the company's actions were not just damaging to shareholders but "undermined the general public's perception of capitalism - full stop". Nevertheless, market reaction suggests most investors were pleased that Mike Ashley would have a more direct role in the company and the shares were up about 5% in morning trade. Mr Ashley's brash style is unorthodox for the founder and executive of a leading UK company. The owner of Newcastle United football club was photographed with a wad of cash when he took shareholders and journalists on a tour of the Shirebrook site after the shareholders' meeting. He also revealed that he travels to work by helicopter. The company employs Mike Ashley's daughter's boyfriend to run its property arm. Financially, the company is not in a good place. The company's shares have fallen by 50% this year, and earlier this month Sports Direct warned that that profits next year would be down on this year.	The founder and majority owner of Sports Direct, Mike Ashley, has stepped in as chief executive after the surprise resignation of Dave Forsey.
Those who saw a drop in enquiries last month outnumbered those who saw a rise by 22%. That is the highest figure reported by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) since August 2008. Rics said the main reason was the stamp duty rise on 1 April, and the uncertainty around the EU referendum. The number of new enquiries fell most dramatically in London, but also fell in nine other regions of the UK. Enquiries rose only in East Anglia, the North and Scotland. Most surveyors also reported a fall in new instructions to sell, and most expect prices to rise over the next three months. Rics chief economist Simon Rubinsohn said the market was characterised by uncertainty. "More ominous is the expectation that both prices and rents will head materially higher over the medium term," he said. Earlier this week the Halifax reported that annual house price inflation fell from 10.1% in March to 9.2% in April.	The number of people interested in buying a house in April fell to its lowest level for nearly eight years, according to surveyors across the UK.
The 35-year-old has been without a club since  at the end of last season. Morrison scored nine goals in 36 games for Ireland and was part of their squad at the 2002 World Cup. The striker is available to play for Exeter in their League Two game at Accrington on Friday night. Morrison began his career at Palace in 1997 and scored 71 goals in 181 games before moving to Birmingham City for club-record fee of £4.25m in 2002. After three seasons at St Andrews he returned to Palace for £2m before moving to Coventry City in 2008. He spent two seasons at the Ricoh Arena before moving on to Sheffield Wednesday, and after loans at MK Dons and Brentford, joined Colchester in 2012.	Exeter City have signed former Republic of Ireland, Crystal Palace and Birmingham City striker Clinton Morrison on non-contract terms.
She outlined her concerns about the consequences of the Brexit vote in a letter to Theresa May on Wednesday. Mrs Foster and Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness highlighted five key priorities to the prime minister. On Thursday, Mrs Foster said: "Brexit means Brexit, but that doesn't mean that we close our eyes to the challenges that are there." She emphasised that Northern Ireland's border must not become a catalyst for illegal activity, nor create an incentive for those who wished to undermine the peace process. "In the past, terrorists have used the border as a way of evading justice and that can not be the case in the future," she said. "We need to make sure that we have strong mechanisms in place to make sure that they don't get away with that sort of activity." In their letter, the first and deputy first ministers highlighted to Mrs May  that Northern Ireland was unique as the only part of the UK that has a border with an EU member state. They also referred to costs, the energy market, drawdown of EU funding and treatment of the agri-food sector as other priorities. During the referendum, Mrs Foster's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) campaigned in favour of Brexit, while Martin McGuinness's Sinn FÃ©in wanted to stay in the EU. When it comes to the economy, they said they wanted to "retain as far as possible the ease with which we currently trade with EU member states". "It would be negligent of me not to point out where I believe the challenges are," Mrs Foster said. "We're extracting ourselves from European Union and it is of course right that we identify where those challenges lie, but I fundamentally believe that there are huge opportunities." Speaking on Thursday, Mr McGuinness said the letter was "a very important indication" that he and Mrs Foster "recognise our huge responsibility to the people we represent". "I think we would've done a grave disservice if we hadn't articulated the differences and challenges we might face in times ahead," he said. "This is about how we protect the interests of the people we represent and the challenges that lie ahead." He added that it was important the he and the first minister "come together in the aftermath of the vote" in spite of having been on different sides of the referendum debate. "My gripe isn't with Arlene Foster, my gripe is with David Cameron who called the referendum in the first place," he said. "This is too big, too serious for us not to be joined up in relation to how we take this process forward." Stormont's opposition parties criticised the letter, with the Ulster Unionist Party's (UUP) economy spokesperson Steve Aiken asking "whether this is a DUP u-turn on their position on the referendum". Mrs Foster replied that the UUP's position on Brexit had been "comical". She added: "Poor Steven Aiken has been sent out once again to be the attack dog against the executive, and frankly he comes across more as a Chihuahua." However, the SDLP's Claire Hanna said: "The first minister has serious questions to answer over the breathtaking reverse ferret she is currently performing. "Ms Foster has clearly realised the error of her ways in backing Brexit, and now the horse has bolted is asking the Conservative government to close the gate." While the UK as a whole voted to leave the EU by 52% to 48%, 56% of people in Northern Ireland voted to remain.	First Minister Arlene Foster has denied that campaigning for the UK to leave the EU was a mistake.
Johnston's goal put Kilcoo 1-6 to 0-6 up early in the second half and was always likely to prove decisive in such a low-scoring contest. Kilcoo's lead was cut to a point but the Down champions moved three ahead again and then held on. Scotstown duo Francis Caulfield and sub Brian McGinnity were sent off late on. Caulfield was dismissed after getting a second yellow card while McGinnity saw red after appearing to strike impressive Kilcoo full-back Darragh O'Hanlon. The Monaghan champions, beaten by Crossmaglen after extra-time in last year's provincial final, only had points from Darren Hughes and Donal Morgan to show for their early domination as several other good chances were missed. Kilcoo hit back with five unanswered points after Aaron Branigan opened up their account in the ninth minute. Conor Laverty's typically busy display was crucial to Kilcoo's improvement as Donal Kane, Paul Devlin (two) and Martin Devlin also notched points. After being held scoreless for almost 20 minutes, Scotstown found their range again late in the first half as the lively Shane Carey pointed a free and keeper Rory Beggan also hit the target from a 45 after missing three earlier long-range efforts. Aidan Branigan's departure at half-time looked a blow for Kilcoo but instead his replacement Johnston went on to become the central personality in the match. The sides were level at 0-6 a piece when Johnston held his nerve to produce a great finish past Beggan after Laverty had flicked on a long ball. After Shane Carey's reply, Johnston looked to have palmed in a second Kilcoo goal but the effort was ruled out - harshly it appeared - for a square ball. The controversial decision looked as though it could be match-turning as another Carey point cut Kilcoo's lead to the minimum but crucially Beggan and Carey then missed chances to get Scotstown on terms. Paul Devlin's superb long-range point and an Aaron Morgan score, after more great work by Laverty, left Kilcoo three ahead with three minutes of normal time left and Carey's seventh point was all Scotstown could summon in the remaining eight minutes of action. In addition to Johnston and Laverty, Niall Branigan and Darragh O'Hanlon were among Kilcoo's stars as they set up a meeting either Kilcar or Glenswilly on 30 October.	Ryan Johnston's half-time introduction help Kilcoo edge out 13-man Scotstown 1-8 to 0-9 in the Ulster Club Football preliminary round game at Clones.
The UNHCR said forced returns had "continued unabated" despite an agreement earlier this month. Under the deal, any returns would be voluntary and only "when conditions were conducive". Cameroon has rejected the accusation and said people returned willingly. According to the UNHCR, more than 2,600 refugees have been forcibly returned to Nigeria from Cameroon this year. Many are unable to go back to their villages in Borno state for security reasons and have ended up in camps for displaced people. In some cases, the UNHCR said, people had been returned "without allowing them time to collect their belongings". UNHCR spokesman Babar Baloch spoke of "chaos" in the returns process and said "some women were forced to leave their young children behind in Cameroon, including a child less than three years old". Many of the returnees are now settled in the Banki camp for internally displaced people. UNHCR staff also recorded about 17 people who claimed to be Cameroonian nationals, who it said had been deported by mistake to Banki. It is common in the region to find people who have no documentary proof of their nationality. Cameroonian Communications Minister Issa Tchiroma told the BBC's Focus on Africa programme: "I strongly deny this accusation" of forced returns. He said the Cameroonian army had been working "hand-in-hand" with the Nigerian army against Boko Haram and any civilians who had returned to Nigeria had done so of their own accord. "This repatriation has taken place willingly," he said. The Cameroonian authorities have previously said Boko Haram militants have been entering the country disguised as refugees. Militants have carried out a number of attacks in northern Cameroon in recent years, often using suicide bombers. The UNHCR said forced return constitutes a serious violation of the 1951 Refugee Convention and the 1969 OAU Convention, both of which Cameroon has ratified. It called on Cameroon to honour its obligations under the conventions and continue keeping its borders open so as to allow access to territory and asylum procedures for people fleeing the Islamist insurgency.	The UN refugee agency has criticised Cameroon for the forced return of hundreds of refugees to north-east Nigeria after they had fled from the Islamist Boko Haram insurgency.
Media playback is not supported on this device Sadio Mane scored twice in the space of 138 seconds as second-placed Spurs disappointed at Anfield. "If you start a game like we start then it is very difficult," said Pochettino. "It is difficult to fight for the Premier League if you show that lack of desire to play for a win." Chelsea can extend their lead at the top if they beat Burnley at Turf Moor on Sunday, and Pochettino added: "If Chelsea go 12 points clear, it is a big problem." Spurs have won just twice on the road since 24 September, including defeats at Chelsea and Manchester United in addition to draws at fellow top-six rivals Arsenal and Manchester City. In their past 17 meetings with the other top-six sides away from home, Pochettino's team have won just once. "In the first 45 minutes you saw a team that is not ready to fight for the Premier League," the Argentine told BT Sport. "We are in a position that is up to us. But if you show like today that you cannot cope with the pressure then it is difficult to challenge and fight for the Premier League." Former Liverpool and Spurs midfielder Danny Murphy on Match of the Day "I couldn't believe what I was watching, they had the best defensive record last season and the joint best this year, but they were all over the place. Against the big sides they have played with a back three but they had a back four today, but I think they should have stuck with what they have done against the big sides - play with a three. "It was so unlike Spurs, they do so well at home, but the contrast is amazing. There's a lack of pace, and a different mindset when they go away from home. They have to improve and quickly."	Tottenham showed a "lack of desire" to win the Premier League with their first-half display in the 2-0 loss at Liverpool, says manager Mauricio Pochettino.
He was put on a flight from Paris to Moscow on Tuesday evening, the French interior ministry said. Mr Shprygin had previously been expelled on Saturday, a week after fan violence marred Russia's Euro 2016 match with England. But he returned overland via Spain, and was arrested at the Russia-Wales match in Toulouse on Monday. He is reported to hold far-right views and his All-Russia Supporters' Union is backed by the Kremlin. Mr Shprygin said four other Russians among those expelled on Saturday had also managed to get back into France for the match against Wales. Investigators believe he flew to Barcelona and crossed the border by car to travel to the French city of Toulouse, where Russia lost 3-0 to Wales. The Russian football team are also going home, having failed to go through to the quarter finals with only one point in the group stage.	The French authorities have expelled controversial Russia fan leader Alexander Shprygin for a second time.
Donald Skene grappled with worshippers and headbutted prayers posted on the walls of the Taj Madina Mosque in Victoria Road last December. Skene, 38, was ordered to complete 156 days of the unexpired portion of his jail term for breaching his licence. He was also sentenced to a year's supervision following his release. Dundee Sheriff Court was told Skene shouted: "I'm white but I'm one of you, brothers", to the Muslim congregation after being arrested. In CCTV footage shown to the court, Skene was seen entering the mosque's wash room and wandering around crying, as members of the congregation prepared to enter the prayer room. Depute fiscal Charmaine Gilmartin the court: "His behaviour is bizarre - attempts are made to try and calm him down." Skene is then seen running in circles around the prayer room as worshippers speak to him. Mrs Gilmartin said: "There are various religious texts in glass frames around the room. "The accused punches some of them and latterly headbutts them. "He had entered using Islamic greetings, and when he was arrested he refers to members of the congregation as brothers and shouts 'I'm white but I'm one of you'." Ross Donnelly, defending, said: "He is very apologetic." Skene admitted charges of breach of the peace and resisting arrest. Allegations that the offence was religiously aggravated were deleted by the Crown. The court was told Skene had already spent 10 weeks on remand for the offence.	A man who rampaged through a Dundee mosque while on licence for seriously assaulting his sister has been returned to prison.
In securing the top spot in Super League they ended their 91-year wait for a top-flight title. First-half tries from Zak Hardaker, Mike McMeeken and Jake Webster set them on their way despite scores from Ben Jones-Bishop and Mason Caton-Brown. Greg Eden ran in, Webster scored a second-half hat-trick and Hardaker went over again as Cas cruised to victory. The Tigers have been in scintillating form all season, recording 22 wins from their 26 league games so far to secure top spot with four games to play. Daryl Powell's side have scored almost 200 points more than anyone else in the league as well as having the tightest defence. The visitors set out at a ferocious pace and had the hosts rattled in the first few minutes, with Liam Finn putting the first points of the day on the board with a penalty. Hardaker went over for the Tigers' first score after a neat pass from Luke Gale before Jones-Bishop levelled the scores with Trinity's first try. Parity was short-lived as McMeeken showed super handling to touch down before Webster extended the lead after a superb break by Hardaker. Wakefield secured the final points of the half when Caton-Brown charged over to get his side back in the game. Danny Kirmond's try for Chris Chester's side stunned the hosts at the start of the second half as Wakefield moved within two, but they responded quickly through Greg Eden's 38th try of the season and Webster's second of the game after Max Jowitt had kicked out on the full. Webster went over twice more either side of Gale landing a drop-goal to put the match firmly out of Trinity's reach with just over 10 minutes to play. Jowitt went over for the visitors but, fittingly, Castleford had the final say as Hardaker touched down after a quick breakaway. BBC Sport's Matt Newsum There will have been a sense of double sweetness for Cas as the triumph came against local rivals Wakefield, who twice relegated them in late-season encounters in 2004 and 2006. The silverware they lifted under the Jungle lights, cruelly dubbed 'The Hubcap' by some league fans, might not rival the big Grand Final prize but it is a reward for consistency - a hallmark of Castleford's play throughout 2017 with 22 wins and four defeats from their 26 Super League games so far. Cas have had 't'lane' rocking this season, with a team honed by head coach Daryl Powell scoring an impressive 142 tries with an open, attacking brand of rugby league befitting the old nickname 'Classy Cas'. Free-scoring winger Greg Eden and England half-back Luke Gale are the more obvious stand-out names, but the success has equally been built on largely unsung aspects such as Paul McShane's dynamic dummy-half play and the pack of ball-handling, hard-tackling forwards such as Grant Millington, Adam Milner and Mike McMeeken. The big challenge for Cas now is to achieve their full potential, taking their week-to-week consistency and applying it to the knock-out football that the play-off semi-finals will bring - in the race for an Old Trafford Grand Final appearance. Castleford coach Daryl Powell told Sky Sports: "It's fantastic. For us, a group of people who have worked so hard from pre-season all the way through to be in this position. Four games (are) left for us and we got the job done. "It's just an awesome feeling. It's a good news story for rugby league, I think the people there, the supporters, have been awesome all year and the boys have been superb. "That's what teams are about. Everyone has played their part. The boys are doing their job and it's crucial that you recognise that everyone has been a part of it. My coaching staff are unbelievable people, outstanding at what they do." Castleford: Hardaker, Minikin, Webster, Shenton, Eden, Roberts, Gale, Millington, McShane, Sene-Lefao, O. Holmes, McMeeken, Massey. Replacements: Lynch, Milner, Moors, Foster. Wakefield: Jowitt, Jones-Bishop, Lyne, Caton-Brown, B. Tupou, Miller, Finn, Fifita, Hadley, England, Ashurst, Kirmond, Arona. Replacements: Williams, Huby, Annakin, Hirst.	Castleford Tigers beat local rivals Wakefield Trinity to clinch the League Leaders' Shield.
The volunteers were angry at the RNLI's decision to shut down the station later this year. They had said they would no longer use the lifeboat to respond to emergencies, and would instead use their own boats. But the crew agreed to take back their pagers at a meeting on Friday night. In a statement, the crew members said they felt they had to do so ahead of the busy summer diving season, but they pledged to continue campaigning to save the St Abbs station. There has been a lifeboat station in St Abbs for more than 100 years. The local volunteers have been credited with saving hundred of lives in and around the seaside town on the east coast of the Borders. But following a review the RNLI announced last week that the St Abbs boat was no longer needed and in future cover would be provided with an additional boat in nearby Eyemouth. Supporters of the station have argued that closing it would put lives at risk.	The crew of the closure-threatened St Abbs lifeboat station in the Borders have agreed to take back their emergency pagers and respond to RNLI call outs.
Wigan have paid "in excess of £200,000" for Tomkins, who they sold to New Zealand Warriors for a reported world record fee of about £700,000 in 2013. Tomkins, 26, will return for the 2016 Super League season. "I am really happy to have this sorted and to be returning home to Wigan," he told the club's website. "All of my friends and family live in Wigan, a lot of them play for Wigan. It really was a no-brainer for me. "It's been a fantastic experience to test myself in the NRL but the reality is I am 13,000 miles away from my friends and family." Wigan chairman Ian Lenagan added on BBC Radio Manchester: "He's back at Wigan which is where he is meant to be." The Super League club had first refusal on Tomkins, who leaves New Zealand with a year remaining on the three-year deal he initially signed. The move reunites Tomkins with his two brothers - forward Joel, 28, and hooker Logan, 22 - who have both been regulars in the Wigan team this season. Tomkins links up again with head coach Shaun Wane whom he is very close to - the 50-year-old coached him during in the youth age groups at the Warriors and they kept in regular contact when he moved to Auckland. As well as being linked with a move to rugby union, after he played a one-off match in the 15-man code for the Barbarians against Australia in 2013, Salford owner Marwan Koukash said they would consider an offer for him. Media playback is not supported on this device After scoring five tries on his first-team debut as a 19-year-old in 2008, Tomkins was a prolific scorer for the Warriors, scoring 144 tries in 152 appearances. He won a domestic double of the Challenge Cup and Grand Final in 2013. Tomkins had an encouraging first season in the NRL and was in the top 15 players for tries, try assists and tackle breaks but has featured just twice this campaign because of a knee injury.	England full-back Sam Tomkins will rejoin Wigan on a four-year deal after he agreed to leave National Rugby League side New Zealand Warriors.
Although the EY Item Club think tank predicts the economy will grow 1.9% this year, it expects that performance to fizzle out as inflation rises. The economy's stability since June's Brexit vote was "deceptive", EY said. Meanwhile, a senior Bank of England official told the BBC that inflation may surpass its 2% target. In an interview to be broadcast on Monday, the Bank's deputy governor Ben Broadbent told Radio 5 live that sterling's weakness would fuel inflation, but that controlling prices with tighter monetary policy could hit growth and jobs. The dilemma facing policymakers was underlined in the Item Club report. It expects inflation to jump to 2.6% next year before easing back to 1.8% in 2018. That will cause growth in consumer spending to slow from an expected 2.5% this year to 0.5% in 2017 and 0.9% the year after, the report said. Business investment is also forecast to fall due to uncertainty surrounding Britain's future trading relationship with the EU, dropping 1.5% this year and more than 2% in 2017. EY predicts that the impact of weaker consumer spending and falling investment will cause UK GDP growth to drop sharply to 0.8% next year, before expanding to 1.4% in 2018. Peter Spencer, chief economic advisor to the EY Item Club, said: "So far it might look like the economy is taking Brexit in its stride, but this picture is deceptive. "Sterling's shaky performance this month provides a timely reminder that challenges lie ahead. As inflation returns over the winter it will squeeze household incomes and spending. "The pressure on consumers and the cautious approach to spending by businesses mean that the UK is facing a period of relatively low growth," he said. The report said that exporters will benefit from the depreciation of sterling, which last week tumbled against a basket of currencies. Exports will increase by 4.5% in 2017 and 5.6% in 2018, EY forecast. But Mr Spencer did not expect this to be enough to offset a wider slowdown. "With activity in the domestic market flat, GDP growth will become heavily dependent upon exports next year," he said. "But once the UK has left the EU certain sectors, such as aerospace, automotive, and chemicals that trade extensively with the EU will be a lot more vulnerable and may need to be supported by subsidies and more robust industrial policies," he said. Some of the economic challenges were spelled out in Mr Broadbent's BBC interview with 5 live's Sean Farrington. The deputy governor, echoing remark's by the Bank's governor Mark Carney last week, said that letting inflation run ahead of the 2% target might ensure the economy does not suffer. Tighter monetary policy to meet the target could lead to "undesirable consequences" such as lower growth and higher unemployment, he said. It's a "trade off", he added.	Britain's economy faces a "prolonged period" of weaker growth as consumer spending slows and business curbs investment, according to a report.
The 21-year-old, who has also played on the wing, has progressed through Wigan's youth system. Tierney is the son of former England dual-code international Jason Robinson, who also played for the Warriors. "It is a huge achievement for me to agree this contract extension and I'm very happy to be staying at my hometown club," said Tierney. His new deal also includes the option of a further year. "Lewis is a good young Wigan kid who knows what it means to play for this great club," added head coach Shaun Wane. "He has improved a greatly in the last few years and it excites me that there is still a lot more improvement to come."	Wigan Warriors full-back Lewis Tierney has signed a new three-year deal with the Super League side until 2019.
She was discovered by soldiers investigating suspected members of Islamist militant group Boko Haram. Nigeria's military said the young woman is undergoing medical checks. A total of 276 schoolgirls were kidnapped by Boko Haram from the town of Chibok in April 2014. About 200 of them are still in captivity. More than 20 were released in October in a deal brokered by the International Red Cross. Others have escaped or been rescued. Over Christmas, 21 of the young women freed under the October deal returned home for the first time. However, family members told the BBC that they were kept in a politician's house and barred from going to their family homes. A statement from the office of state governor Kashim Shettima acknowledged that "armed soldiers... escorted the 21 girls to Chibok and remain their strict guards throughout Christmas". Who are Boko Haram? Chibok girls 'denied family Christmas' Torment of a freed Boko Haram 'bride' Prior to this, the girls had reportedly been held in a secret location for debriefing by the Nigerian government. Two weeks ago, Nigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari said the army had driven Boko Haram's militants from the last camp in their Sambisa forest stronghold in north-eastern Nigeria. "The terrorists are on the run and no longer have a place to hide," Mr Buhari said in a statement. Boko Haram has killed 15,000 people and displaced over two million during its seven-year battle to create an Islamic caliphate in the north-east of the country.	The Nigerian army says that one of the abducted Chibok schoolgirls has been found, along with her six-month-old baby.
The attacker made the devices print a warning urging their owners to cut off remote access. Large printers in offices, domestic devices and tiny receipt printers in restaurants were all caught up in the hack. The attack came soon after a German academic study found vulnerabilities in a wide range of printers. Over the weekend, a hacker using the alias Stackoverflowin ran an automated program that scoured the internet for printers that did not have basic security controls switched on. Once it discovered a vulnerable device, the program made them print a page announcing the invasion and telling the owner to close the "port" used to hijack it. "For the love of God, please close this port, skid [script kiddie, ie novice coder]," said the message. Early versions of the program also added ASCII art depicting different robots or a computer. Also included were an email address and a Twitter handle for Stackoverflowin. Many people posted pictures of the printed messages to social media and asked questions about what was happening on technical support forums and social networks such as Reddit. Printers made by HP, Brother, Epson, Canon, Lexmark, Minolta and many others were hit by Stackoverflowin's program. The hacker said he did not intend to abuse the access he had gained to the printers. "I'm about helping people to fix their problem, but having a bit of fun at the same time," he told the Bleeping Computer tech news website. "Everyone's been cool about it and thanked me to be honest." Last week, computer security researchers Jens Muller, Vladislav Mladenov and Juraj Somorovsky, from the Ruhr University, in Germany, released an academic paper summarising work they had done on printer security. The trio tested 20 separate printers and found that all of them were vulnerable to at least one type of attack. They found ways to put the printers in to an endless loop so they were never available to users, or to hijack the devices so they could be used as an entry point to the computer networks on which they sat.	A hacker has briefly hijacked more than 150,000 printers accidentally left accessible via the web.
The actress revealed in May last year she had had the surgery, after being told she had an 87% chance of the disease because of a high-risk gene. The news encouraged women with genuine concerns about their family history to get advice, a study found. About 5% of breast cancers are thought to be hereditary. "The Angelina Jolie effect has been long-lasting and global, and appears to have increased referrals to centres appropriately," said a team led by ProfÂ Gareth Evans of the University of Manchester. The researchers looked at referrals to more than 20 genetic centres and clinics in the UK after the story hit the press in May 2013. In June and July the number of GP referrals for genetic counselling and DNA tests for breast cancer mutations increased two and a half times compared with the same period in 2012. The study, published in the journal, Breast Cancer Research, found referrals remained at twice the previous year's figure from August to October. "Angelina Jolie stating she has a BRCA1 mutation and going on to have a risk-reducing mastectomy is likely to have had a bigger impact than other celebrity announcements, possibly due to her image as a glamorous and strong woman," said Prof Evans. "This may have lessened patients' fears about a loss of sexual identity post-preventative surgery and encouraged those who had not previously engaged with health services to consider genetic testing." Most breast cancers happen by chance but a small number of people diagnosed with breast cancer (5%) have inherited a fault in one of the known breast cancer genes; BRCA1, BRCA2 or TP53 which puts them at higher risk. Angelina Jolie is not alone in influencing health behaviour. Attendance for cervical cancer screening rose in 2008 and 2009, when the celebrity Jade Goody was diagnosed with cervical cancer and died. Baroness Delyth Morgan is chief executive at Breast Cancer Campaign, which part-funded the research. "Without Angelina Jolie's openness in talking about her BRCA1 mutation and decision to have a risk-reducing mastectomy, followed by the publication and publicity around the updated NICE guidelines soon after, many women may not have approached health services and so would never have had their risk and risk-reducing options explained," she said. Funding for genetic services must be able to respond quickly to demand, to ensure risk counselling and genetic testing is available for everyone in need, she added. "The current level of funding available for this service should be reviewed, to avoid unnecessary delays, which can be very stressful for patients." Women in general have a one in eight chance of developing breast cancer during their lifetime, but genes can put some at higher risk. In the UK, about one in 1,000 people will have inherited a BRCA1 mutation and a similar proportion will have inherited a BRCA2 mutation. Women who are tested early can take steps to prevent themselves from developing the disease. This may mean a risk-reducing mastectomy, cancer preventing drugs, such as tamoxifen, and certain lifestyle changes like a healthy diet and more exercise. Lester Barr, chairman of Genesis Breast Cancer Prevention, said: "While a woman's risk of developing breast cancer and/or ovarian cancer is greatly increased if she carries the harmful mutation of the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene, preventative surgery is by no means the answer for everyone. "Of course, a preventative mastectomy is the most effective way to cut a woman's risk of breast cancer, however other options should also be considered. These include prevention drugs, such as tamoxifen, which has been approved by NICE. "Alternatively, many women with a mutated BRCA gene opt for annual check-ups which can be arranged through the NHS."	Referrals to breast cancer clinics more than doubled in the UK after Angelina Jolie announced she had had a double mastectomy to prevent breast cancer.
Flames could be seen shooting from the roof of Scotway House, close to the city's Riverside Museum, after the fire broke out on Friday evening. The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service sent a number of appliances to the scene. There were no reports of injuries, and the nearby Riverside Museum was not damaged. Scotway House is located on a large plot of wasteland west of Yorkhill Park. It was built in 1885 as a drawing office for ship building firm D&W Henderson at the Meadowside Shipyard, and is a category B-listed building. The building has been empty for about 20 years. Since the doors were closed it has been considered for a pub and restaurant development and a music venue. Last year plans were submitted to convert the building as part of a student housing development on the site. The Glasgow Harbour area is currently undergoing a major redevelopment.	Firefighters have put out a major blaze which swept through a derelict listed building in Glasgow.
Quick-Step Floors' Trentin reeled in and surged past Spain's Juan Jose Lobato, with Belgium's Tom van Asbroeck third in Tarragona. Four-time Tour de France champion Froome finished in the bunch on the 198km stage from Escaldes-Engordany. The Team Sky rider, 32, still holds a two-second lead. Spain's David de la Cruz, Irishman Nicolas Roche and American Tejay van Garderen are his closest challengers. Froome is aiming to become only the third rider to win the Tour and the Vuelta in the same year. Trentin, 28, has now won a stage in all three Grand Tours, adding to victory at the 2016 Giro d'Italia and wins in the 2013 and 2014 Tours de France. "I'm really proud to have done this with this team," said Trentin. "I was really looking for this stage win as I've been going well in the last part of the season." Quick-Step have won two of the four stages of this year's Vuelta, following Yves Lampaert's victory on stage two. They held the race together to set up Trentin for a bunch sprint after the breakaway duo of Stephane Rossetto and Diego Rubio were caught inside the final 10km. Britain's Simon Yates moved up to 10th in the general classification, 48 seconds behind Froome, after Italy's Domenico Pozzovivo crashed late on and lost three minutes 25 seconds. Yates' twin brother and Orica-Scott team-mate Adam remains eighth overall, a further nine seconds ahead, while former winner Vincenzo Nibali of Italy still trails Froome by 10 seconds. Wednesday's fifth stage takes the riders 176km over rolling terrain from Benicassim to Alcossebre, culminating in a short but steep uphill finish. 1.

The incident involving a black Ford Ka happened on St Fillans Road at about 21:00 on Saturday. The girl is being treated at Ninewells Hospital in Dundee. Police have asked for anyone who may have witnessed the collision, or who saw a black Ford Ka in the area at the time, to come forward.	An eight-year-old girl is in a critical condition after being hit by a car in Dundee.
Persistent showers fell through the first half and the rain became extremely heavy during half-time and in the early stages of the second half. Puddles appeared on the pitch but play continued and the rain finally stopped. Zambia's Evans Kangwa missed a great chance late on while Antonio Varela earlier headed over at the other end. Cape Verde missed out on qualifying on goals scored after only finding the net once in three matches, with a penalty, compared to DR Congo's two strikes. The weather will be the main talking point in a match from which either side could have qualified for the quarter-finals. Tunisia's first-half goal against DR Congo left Cape Verde, who only needed a draw to go through, in pole position but the equaliser in that match meant that both teams progressed. Zambia, winners in 2012, needed a victory to progress and Rainford Kalaba came close to putting his side ahead in the 24th minute when he cut inside and hit a shot which deflected past the post. Seven minutes later, Zambia failed to clear a free-kick which was hit deep into their penalty area and the ball broke to Calu who blazed over the bar. Kalaba caused Cape Verde more problems three minutes before half-time when his free-kick from 25 yards forced goalkeeper Vozinha to punch the ball away. But the Blue Sharks nearly went ahead seconds before the interval when Varela stooped to meet a free-kick six yards out but could only head over the top. The early stages of the second half were farcical with players struggling to keep their footing and pass the ball more than a few yards at times. But the match continued and as the rain stopped falling, the conditions eased for the players. Cape Verde substitute Djaniny tried his luck from 20 yards out midway through the second half but Zambia goalkeeper Kennedy Mweene was equal to it. Djaniny caused more problems nine minutes later when he combined with fellow substitute Odair Fortes but he could not quite beat Mweene. Zambia's moment arrived in the 78th minute when a lovely centre from Chisamba Lungu set up Kangwa but he somehow missed the target from 10 yards. Cape Verde coach Rui Aguas: "I'm very sad and disappointed with the result but not with my players. They did all they could. "We missed a lot of chances in three games but we gave 100 per cent, we gave our all. "Zambia and us were the best teams in the group. For Congo there is happiness. One goal makes all the difference, one miss makes all the difference. Football is often cruel and it is now our turn to feel it." Zambia coach Honour Janza: "It is sad but let us be positive that the future looks bright for our team, the young boys we came with here will be a force in African football in the next two to three years."

Margarita Louis-Dreyfus, Marseille's billionaire owner, said in April that she would sell the club following poor results and protests from fans. McCourt, speaking at a news conference, said: "I'm very excited about making Marseille a champion again." A deal is set to be completed by the end of the year and no fee has yet been disclosed. Appearing alongside Louis-Dreyfus and Marseille mayor Jean-Claude Gaudin, 63-year-old McCourt said he wants a team that can compete "year in, year out" to win Ligue 1. Marseille, who finished 13th in 2015/16 and lost to PSG in the French cup final, are 11th after three games this season.	Frank McCourt, the former owner of the LA Dodgers baseball team, is set to buy French Ligue 1 club Marseille.
Bowe, 32, played in the first half of the game in Naas and came through unscathed before being replaced at half-time as had been the plan. The Lions star had been out since sustaining a knee injury in Ireland's World Cup defeat by Argentina. Bowe suffered posterior cruciate ligament and meniscal damage. His return is a timely boost as the Belfast club attempt to secure a place in the Pro12 play-offs. Les Kiss's men are currently fifth in the standings and have three matches left, against Zebre, Leinster and Ospreys. Darren Cave captained the Ulster A team as they earned a 38-31 win in Thursday's game.	Ireland winger Tommy Bowe played his first match since October in the Ulster's A game against their Munster counterparts on Thursday.
The spelling error was spotted close to the High Street in Warsop, Nottinghamshire on Friday afternoon. Eric Hill quickly photographed the sign, which should have read "right", prior to the error being painted over. A spokesman for the Co-op said the contractors were made aware of their mistake and would amend the spelling "as quickly as possible".	Contractors were left red-faced after incorrectly painting the word "rihgt" on a road off a supermarket car park.
Lee Gaskell grabbed the game's first try after 22 minutes, with Danny Brough adding the extras and a later penalty to make it 8-0 at half-time. Ukuma Ta'ai's touchdown for the hosts was followed by Gaskell's second as Huddersfield built a 20-point lead. Josh Drinkwater got Leigh's only try before Leroy Cudjoe completed the win. Huddersfield's triumph, their second in as many weeks over the competition's bottom two sides, confirms the make up of the Super 8s and Qualifiers. Warrington, who won the League Leaders' Shield last season and lost both major finals in 2016, are resigned to having to battle to avoid relegation. Leigh, whose captain Micky Higham made his 500th career appearance in the defeat, need to beat near neighbours Salford next week and hope that Widnes fail to overcome Warrington if they are to avoid finishing bottom after 23 Super League games. Huddersfield Giants boss Rick Stone: "It was a tough, physical game and we showed some good resilience. "Our goal is now to win as many games as we can and we have a few boys to come back from injury." On confirming a top eight finish: "I was always confident as most of the time we were a bit banged up with injuries and I felt once we got those players back it would help us. "It started probably at the Magic Weekend with a bit of a rusty win over Catalans. We began to respect the process a bit more - the boys have bought into that and the last couple of months have been good." Leigh Centurions coach Neil Jukes: "I thought we turned up for one another and had a real dig, but there were just too many silly scenarios which kept putting unforced pressure on ourselves. "While the scoreline doesn't look great, to do the amount of defending we did shows that there's still a good work ethic within them. But regarding smartness we probably get one out of 10." Huddersfield Giants: Rankin; McGillvary, Cudjoe, S Wood, McIntosh; Gaskell, Brough; Rapira, Leeming, Ikahihifo, Roberts, Ferguson, Hinchcliffe. Replacements: O'Brien, Wakeman, Clough, Ta'ai. Leigh Centurions: Brown; Higson, Crooks, Langi, Dawson; Mortimer, Drinkwater; Hock, Higham, Hansen, Paterson, Vea, Stewart. Replacements: Pelissier, Tickle, Hopkins, Burr. Referee: Scott Mikalauskas	Huddersfield Giants confirmed their Super League status for another season with a comfortable win over bottom side Leigh Centurions.
Comparisons will inevitably be made with the legendary centre and former Irish captain. After all, Ringrose wears the number 13, played for Blackrock, UCD, Leinster and didn't start his rugby career as a centre. But the 22-year-old new kid on the block appears destined to make a name for himself and his entry into the Six Nations fray is keenly anticipated. Ireland coach Joe Schmidt was careful not to throw Ringrose into the international arena too early. But the emerging player is regarded as a young man with a mature head in his shoulders, someone well equipped to handle hype and huge media attention. But, what makes him so special? What are the qualities that had O'Driscoll himself calling for the Leinster lad to be included in Ireland's last Six Nations campaign? "He has been anointed the next Brian O'Driscoll. Brian was similar at that age, efficient and solid," says Eddie O'Sullivan, Ireland's coach from 2001 to 2008. "Garry's trademark is he is incredibly efficient. Young players make bloopers, but he doesn't make mistakes. It's important to remain calm under pressure and then when your opportunity comes, you take it. "Brian didn't make mistakes and then he stepped up. No-one expected him to score a try in Paris in 2000, but he scored three. "Then no-one expected him to score that try against Australia for the Lions a year later, but he did. These are the moments. They came to him and he took them. Then he kicked on, kept improving." Ringrose made his senior Ireland debut in the autumn international against Canada last November, a week after being an unused replacement in that historic win over the All Blacks in Chicago. He then scored his first international try in the exciting 27-24 win over Australia in Dublin. Ringrose played his school rugby for Blackrock College in Dublin, although when he joined the senior side, he wasn't seen as one of their better players. Hopping from number nine to 15 and not being offered a permanent position, he kept his head down and eventually an injury opened up a spot at 13. After the switch, he remained their kicker and his points tally propelled Blackrock to the Leinster Senior Cup. Suddenly people were asking who this guy was and he was off to UCD with a glowing reputation. Bobby Byrne, the Director of Rugby at UCD, recalls: "I first came across Gary in that run to the Senior Cup. He wasn't overly recognised at that stage but suddenly he was having a significant impact for the team. He is the player I am most looking forward to seeing in this year's Six Nations. "He had composure, was an elusive runner and was really courageous. He hadn't the biggest frame, but he had a good bit of pace to finish off. "He had, and still has, a great temperament. He is a very balanced guy. The rate of improvement since he has left school has been phenomenal. "He has improved every year and he's conscious that he always needs to improve, so his discipline on and off the pitch is great. He has all the things that you need to succeed." Former Ireland international backs Tony Ward and Jonny Bell are excited about what impact Ringrose can have on this year's Six Nations. Ward, who starred in a famous Munster win over New Zealand in 1978, says: "He showed us his mental strength in that Australia game last autumn. "With Robbie Henshaw injured and when Jared Payne came off, he went from being the third or fourth choice to a guy at the top of the heap. "He really stepped up and I just think he is an amazing talent. He is the player I am most looking forward to seeing in this year's Six Nations." Ulster man Bell knows a thing or two about spotting talent. A decorated centre himself, he's now one of the coaches at Gloucester. Again, comparisons with other Irish 13s were impossible to avoid. "Everyone keeps likening him to Brian O'Driscoll. He can find space, he's elusive and can break tackles. "He has good leg drive. At this level, you have to have ability. To work against these hard defensive systems, you must have that innate natural ability, and Garry has that in droves." According to Bell, Ringrose definitely has the ability and mental strength to succeed, but those qualities need to be complemented by hard work. "He has a very diligent approach, and that is very important in the modern game," adds Bell. "If you look at the likes of Danny Cipriani, he had amazing ability but he hasn't really produced what he is capable of. He's done well, but not hit the heights he maybe could have because of outside distractions." By all accounts, Ringrose has the right mix to succeed at the very top level. If he keeps improving, that step up from first class to world class will seem to be a 'when' rather than an 'if'. Let's leave the last word to Girvan Dempsey who won 82 Ireland caps between 1998 and 2008 and is now Leinster's backs coach. "Dealing with him right from the off, even from 17, you could tell he was rugby-smart. He just got it," said former full-back Dempsey. "He just bounces onto the training field. And we're just constantly looking forward to seeing what's going to come next. "Garry loves expressing himself, and certainly we'd never, ever want to curb that in any way because it's so refreshing. "Hopefully he'll just keep getting better and better as time goes on."	Garry Ringrose has never played in the Six Nations before - but he's already being hailed as Ireland's best prospect since Brian O'Driscoll.
A group of scientists have invented a gadget which turns pee into electricity. They hope it could be used in some poorer countries, as a way to create clean and renewable energy. The system was developed by scientists at the Bristol Bioenergy Centre (BBiC) in the Bristol Robotics Laboratory at the University of the West of England (UWE Bristol). The invention will be tried out this week on festival-goers at the Glastonbury music festival in Somerset. Urine, or wee is fed into a special machine called a microbial fuel cell, which contains a type of bacteria. These tiny bacteria break down the wee and create electrons. These electrons are then forced through an electronic circuit, creating a flow of electricity. This electricity can then be used to power all sorts of things, including your phone!	The UK's biggest music festival Glastonbury is trying out some pretty special toilets this year, which could help you charge your smartphone.
The Swift Archway Cranford 545 caravan was stolen from a site in Yaxley, Cambridgeshire, on Thursday night. Davis tweeted "My touring caravan was stolen.. even though it was locked up with hitch & wheel lock! I want to swear... #rotters". He added the thieves could have "headed north or south on A1, or west on A14". Cambridgeshire Police said: "We have had a report of a caravan being stolen in the Yaxley area between 5pm on Thursday and 12.45pm on Friday. We are investigating." Davis, who played the role of Wicket in the third of the original Star War movies, is also appearing in the forthcoming Star Wars: Episode VII. Davis's credits include Professor Flitwick in the Harry Potter films and Nikabrik in The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian. Anyone with information about the caravan is asked to call Cambridgeshire Police.	Star Wars and Harry Potter star Warwick Davis, who played an ewok in Return of the Jedi, has taken to Twitter to help recover his stolen caravan.
Satellite images show colonies moving their locations in years when the thin sea ice on which they habitually breed forms late or is absent. Scientists report the observations in the online journal Plos One. They reveal the birds travelling long distances to find alternative sites. These are further in towards the coast, up on the ice shelves - the thick slabs of glacier ice that jut out over the ocean. It is a surprise because these shelves are frequently faced with cliffs that may be tens of metres high in places. But somehow, the emperors find a way up to breed, and also to come and go as they forage for the seafood that will sustain their chicks. "We thought that in years when the sea ice was bad, they just didn't breed, but they're clearly more adaptable than that," said lead author Peter Fretwell from the British Antarctic Survey. The emperor is the most southerly of the Antarctic penguin species and the only one to breed on sea ice in the southern winter. Their reliance on these thin seasonal marine floes as a reproductive platform, coupled with concern about how the patterns of Antarctic sea ice could change in a warming world, has led to the species being designated as "near threatened" on the IUCN red list. Currently, the extent of winter sea ice in the Antarctic is growing year by year, albeit slowly. The coverage does however vary considerably by region, and climate computer models indicate any gains will very likely be reversed later this century. But this study on four colonies around the continent suggests emperors do have the capacity to meet and beat some of the challenges that may lie ahead. In the observations of Shackleton Ice Shelf in East Antarctica, for example, the penguins are seen to be very adept at finding the routes that allow them to get past a 30m-high cliff. "When they go out from the colony to forage, they go down the steep cliff - the shortest route to the sea. We're not sure how they get down - they may slide down or jump down," Mr Fretwell told BBC News. "But this cliff is too steep for them to climb back up and so they must return a different way, likely through an ice creek. This route is 5km longer and we know they take it because we can see their tracks in the satellite pictures." There is a big opportunity here to go study these penguins which have yet to be visited by an expedition. There is obviously some cost to going up on the ice shelves - they are windier and the birds must travel further to forage. If that cost was not there, they would habitually breed on the shelves rather than the temperamental thin floes.  But how big this cost is and how beneficial is the observed adaptation in years of poor sea ice has yet to be properly established. Co-author Barbara Wienecke from the Australian Antarctic Division said: "These new findings are an important step forward in helping us understand what the future may hold for these animals. However, we cannot assume that this behaviour is widespread in other penguin populations. "The ability of these four colonies to relocate to a different environment - from sea ice to ice shelf - in order to cope with local circumstances, was totally unexpected. "We have yet to discover whether or not other species may also be adapting to changing environmental conditions." Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos	Emperor penguins have displayed some unexpected breeding behaviour in the Antarctic that could mean they are much more resilient to environmental change than previously recognised.

Chris Weir said she and her husband Colin were "tickled pink" when they realised they had scooped Tuesday's jackpot. "I even had a glass of white wine which is something I normally only do at Christmas!" laughed Chris. The prize was Europe's biggest ever and was capped after a series of rollovers. On the night of the draw Chris was checking their numbers on the BBC's Red Button digital text service about midnight on the television in their bedroom. "I started circling the numbers I had matched but wasn't doing very well. Then on the fifth line, all the circles seemed to join up." The telephone line run by Camelot for claims was closed. Chris and husband Colin sat up all night they were so excited. "When we first realised we had won, it felt like a dream," Colin said. "Everything went into slow motion." Life changing When asked at a media conference in Falkirk what they will do with the money, Chris said: "We're not flashy people." "The next steps are going to be the most difficult... with great wealth comes great responsibility," added Colin. The Weirs have both had serious health conditions in recent years and have not been able to work. Colin, 64, had previously worked as a television cameraman and Chris, 55, is a fully-trained psychiatric nurse. The most exciting aspect of their windfall is the opportunity to travel. "We have both always wanted to see the Great Wall of China and Colin would love to stand at the foot of Ayers Rock in Australia," said Chris. "We also love art galleries, so this gives us the chance to visit those in Paris and in Russia. These are all things we thought we would never see." They have also already decided to buy homes for their two children, Carly and Jamie (both in their 20s). UK winning streak Before Tuesday's draw, the largest lottery winner in the UK was the player who claimed £113m in the Euromillions last October and chose to remain anonymous. The couple have displaced former postal worker Angela Kelly from East Kilbride, who became Scotland's biggest winner in August 2007 when she scooped £35,425,411.80 in the Euromillions jackpot. Britons have banked the Euromillions jackpot more than 14 times in the last two years. Last year, two anonymous UK winners scooped £113m and £84m. And Nigel and Justine Page, from Gloucestershire, won the £56m jackpot prize on EuroMillions in February 2010. National Lottery operator Camelot runs the Euromillions draw in the UK and has also had the same role for the weekly Lotto draw since it was launched in 1994. The firm says that its draws have created about 2,400 lottery millionaires in the UK in the intervening 17 years. If the winner of Tuesday's draw had been a single player, he or she would instantly have been placed 430th in this year's Sunday Times Rich List just above Scottish businessman Sir Angus Grossart and Irina Abramovich, the former wife of Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich. Two other UK-based lottery players won £1.7m after they successfully matched five numbers and one Lucky Star.	A couple from Largs in Ayrshire have been named as the winners of the £161m Euromillions jackpot.
United will be in the Champions League and boss Jose Mourinho said executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward has had his targets "for more than two months". Mourinho wants to enhance his forward and defensive options to challenge for the Premier League title next season. United have been linked with Atletico Madrid striker Antoine Griezmann and Burnley centre-back Michael Keane. "Ed Woodward has my list," the Portuguese manager said after his side beat Ajax to win the Europa League for the first time on Wednesday. "Now it's up to him and the owners." Griezmann has a 100m euro release clause in his contract and the 26-year-old France international said earlier this week that his chances of joining United were "six out of 10". Since then, a major stumbling block has been removed by United securing the return of Champions League football. They will go straight into the group stage after their victory over Ajax in Stockholm. Griezmann has the pace and trickery United lack but, should a move falter, Torino forward Andrea Belotti is another option. The 23-year-old Italy international has scored 25 goals in Serie A this season. Keane, meanwhile, left United for Burnley in January 2015 but Mourinho is known to be eager to bring the 24-year-old defender back to Old Trafford. The Portuguese views predecessor Louis van Gaal's decision to sell the centre-back for £2m as a mistake and believes his central defensive options are limited. In theory, a 25% sell-on clause agreed at the time of that deal should bring the price down. However, Burnley manager Sean Dyche has said the Clarets have no financial need to sell Keane, who made his England debut in March. Prior to the January transfer window, United showed interest in Benfica's Sweden centre-back Victor Lindelof, 22, while left-back is another area of weakness. Earning Champions League football means United have avoided the potential loss of £50m in sponsorship income and prize money. However, one senior club source said the forthcoming transfer window was likely to be "crazy", given the increased spending power within the Premier League as a result of the new £8.3bn TV deal and clubs such as Inter Milan and AC Milan willing to spend big to try to rediscover former glories. A year ago, Mourinho marked his first summer at Old Trafford by bringing in striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic, defender Eric Bailly and midfielder Henrikh Mkhitaryan by the first week in July, before midfielder Paul Pogba re-signed from Juventus for a world record £89m in early August. In December, BBC Sport was told the United manager felt he needed at least two more transfer windows to shape his squad. Mourinho decided not to buy in January, but since then Ibrahimovic and defender Marcos Rojo have suffered cruciate knee-ligament injuries which will keep them out until next year and former Germany midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger has left for Major League Soccer in the United States. United went on to finish sixth in the Premier League which, apart from the disastrous campaign under David Moyes in 2013-14, was their lowest placing since 1991.	Manchester United are likely to limit their summer spending to three or four key signings.
Credit rating agencies, in essence, rate a country on the strength of its economy. More specifically, they score governments (or large companies) on how likely they are to pay back their debt. A rating affects how much it costs governments to borrow money in the international financial markets. In theory, a high credit rating means a lower interest rate (and vice versa). This is because of concerns at the impact that leaving the European Union may have on the UK economy. Moody's warned that the referendum result may have "negative implications for the country's medium-term growth outlook". In addition to Moody's, the other two main credit rating agencies are Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings. All three are private companies, not government agencies. Moody's and Standard & Poor's both have their headquarters in New York, while Fitch has two official HQs, one in New York and the other in London. Each agency gives countries around the world a specific credit rating score. These range from a top mark of "AAA", which stands for "prime", down to the lowest reading of "D", which stands for "in default". In between there are scores such as "BBB" or "CC". Moody's has at total of 21 ratings. The agencies also give outlook-assessments. These are either "positive", "stable", or "negative". They indicate whether the agency in question thinks it may soon raise its rating (positive), downgrade it (negative), or leave it the same (stable) for the country in question. In the case of Moody's and the UK, the agency currently scores the UK at "Aa1", the second highest rating on its scale, which stands for "high grade". Yet, while Moody's previously saw no change to that Aa1 rating, it has now warned that it may lower it. A country's credit rating can affect how much it costs a governments to borrow money on the global markets. More specifically, the worse a nation's credit rating, the more likely it is that the country in question has to offer a higher rate of return on its bonds in other to persuade people and financial institutions to buy them. This is because the lower a country's credit rating, the more the agencies are concerned about its economy, and in turn the taxes that the government in question can raise. Ratings can be a warning system for potential investors, and make it more expensive for poorly-rated nations to borrow money. Although Moody's is the first of the big three ratings agencies to make an official change to its position on the UK post-referendum, the Financial Times reported on Friday that Standard & Poor's considers its current top rating for the UK as "no longer tenable". Currently S&P rates the UK as AAA (negative), while Fitch Ratings' score is AA+ (stable). For Fitch, AA+ is its second-highest score. They have committees of experts who determine the actually rating for each country or large company. S&P says its committees typically consist of between five and eight people. They base their assessment on a range of financial and business factors that may influence a government or company's ability to repay its debt, such as the UK voting to leave the European Union, or a business announcing a huge loss. Standard & Poor's is the oldest. It traces its history back to 1860 when financial analyst Henry Poor wrote a history of the finances of railroads and canals in the US as a guide for investors. He then formed a business called HV and HW Poor. Meanwhile, the Standard Statistics Bureau was set up in 1906 to examine the finances of non-railroad companies. The two businesses joined forces in 1940 when S&P was formed. Moody's was started in 1909 by John Moody, who published an analysis of the tangled and uncertain world of railway finances, grading the value of its stocks and bonds. Fitch, with another eponymous founder, John Fitch, was set up in 1913. There are hosts of other ratings agencies, but S&P, Moody's and Fitch have about 95% of the global market. S&P and Moody's have about 40% each, while Fitch has around 15%. They are so dominant because they were the first to be officially endorsed by the US financial watchdog, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In 1975, the SEC acknowledged the three as "Nationally Recognised Statistical Organisations". So a rating from any of the three is considered to be the gold standard. They charge companies for their ratings - it's as simple as that. This has led to critics suggesting that the agencies are tempted to give firms over-generous scores in order to win repeat business, something they all strenuously deny. They were indeed, for giving top AAA ratings to debt packages that turned out to include billions of dollars of bad US mortgages. When the US homeowners in question started to default on their repayments it sparked the financial crisis. The credit rating agencies were heavily criticised by politicians, and had to settle a number of lawsuits.	Moody's, one of the big three credit ratings agencies, has cut its outlook for the UK economy from "stable" to "negative".

Ledley hopes the former Fulham boss will stay in charge for the 2018 World Cup qualifying campaign. "We want him to be here for many years to come," said Ledley. Media playback is not supported on this device "What he's done for us and the whole nation is remarkable. "It's all new to us, but I'm sure something will be sorted sooner or later." Wales continue their preparations for this summer's European Championships with a home friendly against Northern Ireland on Thursday, before visiting Ukraine four days later. Coleman has said wives, girlfriends and family members will be banned from Wales' team hotel during the early stages of their Euro 2016 campaign. Asked if he was happy with the decision, Crystal Palace midfielder Ledley joked: "Yeah, definitely, peace and quiet! "We want to be in great shape and if that means sacrificing five weeks of your life then happy days. "It's going to be a great one and I'm sure everyone will understand. It's a good decision from the manager." Midfielder Joe Allen has started only three of Liverpool's Premier League games this season. The former Swansea City player said: "The silver lining I guess in having not played that much this season is going into the Euros I'm hoping that I might have fresh legs and hopefully I can peak a bit later than a lot of other players." The 26-year-old says his season "has been okay on a personal level, but then it has been incredible from a Wales point of view". Allen added: "I'm not somebody who needs an extra incentive to go and work hard in training every day, but it has been great to have the knowledge that France was coming up in the back of my mind. "I think for every player in the squad they have known what is waiting at the end of the season, and that's been amazing for everyone. "It has made sure everyone has pushed themselves, and sub-consciously or not worked a little bit harder."	Wales players want manager Chris Coleman to sign a new contract, according to midfielder Joe Ledley.
The plant will create 150 jobs on the Ebbw Vale enterprise zone, which is still hoping to be home to the Â£325m Circuit of Wales. New owners, who bought the British brand three years ago, will start production next year. The company has a 10-year plan, including four new models, and will begin making a few hundred cars a year. TVR had been looking at three sites around the UK. Mr Jones said: "This is yet another fantastic high profile investment for Wales and a great boost for our automotive sector. "TVR is another iconic and much loved, world-class brand that still commands a strong and loyal international following. I am delighted the next generation of TVRs will proudly bear the label Made in Wales." There have been 350 advance orders for the car already, after images of what it might look like were released late last year. TVR chairman Les Edgar  said: "This is a fantastic opportunity both for TVR and the Welsh Government. "South Wales is becoming a major hub for automotive and motor sport technology and development and I am delighted TVR is investing here." The company hopes to be producing around 2,000 cars a year by 2022, targeting the UK and selected European markets initially. It will initially assemble the car in Ebbw Vale - bringing in the V8 engines from Cosworth in Northampton. Former F1 designer Gordon Murray is behind iStream carbon technology to give the new models extra strength. THE HISTORY OF THE TVR Analysis by Sarah Dickins, BBC Wales economics correspondent The automotive industry in Wales already includes 40 component manufacturers and more than 100 other firms in the supply chain. Ford and Toyota have engine plants and Aston Martin recently announced plans to assemble a new model in the Vale of Glamorgan. The Welsh Automotive Forum estimates 18,000 people work in the sector in Wales, with sales worth Â£3.2bn a year. But the impact of the sector is greater than just the number of people working in it. On the whole it's an industry that pays well. On top of that it has to be innovative. It is continually having to improve design and models to make vehicles cleaner and more efficient. Component makers also have to keep looking at the way they themselves work so they keep winning contracts to supply the car makers. As a result, it is an industry that tends to be high on training and big on investment in its people and machines. That means it is of more benefit to the Welsh economy than the same number of workers in other industries. TVR will bring much needed jobs to the Heads of the Valleys and a simplified assembly process, so its factory only needs to be 20% of the size of a conventional plant. It estimates this could reduce capital investment in the assembly plant by around 80%. The first minister would not be drawn on how the Welsh Government had supported the deal. But he said the news, hot on the heels of the Aston Martin announcement "sends out a strong, clear message that Wales is the location of choice for advanced manufacturing". Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns said it showed the Welsh automotive industry was "surging from strength to strength." He added: "Today's news is yet another strong endorsement of the quality of Britain's car industry, which has been creating jobs, taking on apprentices and contributing to building a stronger economy." Although an impression of the new car was released last year, the design of the first new vehicle is still under wraps with plans to unveil it towards the end of 2016, with production starting next year. Circuit of Wales chief executive Martin Whitaker welcomed the news as "fantastic" for the region. "Paired with Aston Martin's recent announcement, it reinforces our vision of Ebbw Vale and the south Wales region growing into a cluster of excellence for automotive and related industries," he added.	Sports car company TVR is to base its new factory in Wales, First Minister Carwyn Jones has announced.
Media playback is not supported on this device "You're not wanted any more" rang around Cherry Red Records Stadium in Kingston as the home supporters put their own twist on Gerrard's decision to decline a new Liverpool contract and move to the United States next summer. Liverpool's followers were only too happy to offer the conflicting view - and no wonder after their 34-year-old captain once again dragged them out of hazardous terrain to safety almost single-handed with both goals in this 2-1 FA Cup third round win. If Gerrard needed - not that he does - to build a monument to what Liverpool will miss when he goes, this was the perfect template and left the questions hanging in the air. Gerrard's departure next May has been presented by Liverpool and the player himself as the right time for the parting of the ways. This iconic captain's future would have been carefully managed had he stayed another year, with his number of performances inevitably reduced. It seems Gerrard does not want, or indeed deserve, to close out his magnificent career with a lengthy spell of bench-warming. It is tempting to use every significant Gerrard intervention as part of the case for the prosecution to accuse Liverpool of failing to do enough to keep him - and even this superb performance should be placed in the context that it was with a middling League Two team in opposition. And would he be able to sustain this level of performance and energy, especially in a more advanced role, on a weekly basis in the Premier League into next season? Valid questions but questions Liverpool's fans were prepared to set to one side on Monday. Even now, with the credits rolling on his Liverpool career, they still have no-one like Gerrard who can give them hope when it seems lost, such as against FC Basel with his late free-kick on the night they went out of the Champions League, or here against AFC Wimbledon, when he produced yet again when matters were starting to look extremely difficult. Jordan Henderson is Gerrard's successor-in-waiting as Liverpool captain but does not yet come within light years of the impact the current incumbent has either on the field or off. He is still a developing player and personality so it is actually a tough comparison, but how can he, or indeed anyone else, follow Gerrard as a leader in battle, a figure afforded total respect (perhaps even fear when it comes to opponents) off the field or as a symbol for the fans? Whether Liverpool like it or not, this debate will run and run until the day Gerrard walks out of Anfield for the final time and perhaps even beyond - it was certainly raging on Monday night. Gerrard's former Liverpool team-mate Jamie Carragher, who feels aggrieved that the midfielder has somehow been allowed to drift away from Anfield, tweeted on his @Carra23 account: "If Gerrard was one of the new signings at 24 we'd be raving about him but we judge him at 34 against himself at his peak." Carragher had earlier tweeted: "Liverpool struggled for goals this season. Their top scorer is going to the MLS next season!" Even QPR striker Charlie Austin tweeted: "How can Liverpool let this man go?" Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers was the subject of lavish praise in Gerrard's abdication speech, with the player saying he wished he had worked under the manager a decade ago, but there is no doubt there will be questions for the club's owners and executive staff every time he affects events as he did against AFC Wimbledon. Gerrard's former Liverpool team-mate and room-mate Danny Murphy told BBC Sport on Match of the Day: "Liverpool are very fortunate they've got Steven Gerrard as his two bits of quality have been the difference between the sides and not much else." And Alan Shearer added: "There was one guy who dragged Liverpool through by the scruff of the neck. How many times have we said this over the years? It was his performance, his goals, his work-rate, his effort." Shearer also drew the parallel with Chelsea's decision to let Frank Lampard go, only to see him turn up at Manchester City as a danger to his old club's Premier League title chances. Gerrard has made it clear he will never play against Liverpool but Shearer added: "I just wonder whether Chelsea look at the Frank Lampard situation and just wish that they hadn't let him go. I wonder if Liverpool will do the same." The bottom line is that no matter how much Liverpool look to the future, the player and inspiration they still rely on is Steven Gerrard. For that overall impact on games, his colleagues and his club, he will be impossible to replace. Liverpool's debt to Gerrard was placed in even sharper relief by the fact it allowed them to secure an FA Cup fourth round tie at home to Bolton Wanderers despite seeing the usual fault lines exposed by AFC Wimbledon. After Gerrard put Liverpool ahead in the 12th minute, there was a period of relative calm as Neil Ardley's side were subdued and the Premier League giants looked in control. It did not last long as Liverpool's defence came under pressure and, as it has done so often this season, almost instantly looked incapable of coping. Sean Rigg had already missed one good chance before he forced a save from Simon Mignolet and it was alarming to see how a routine kick from AFC Wimbledon goalkeeper James Shea created various degrees of panic and a chance that Matt Tubbs wasted. Wimbledon's equaliser from Adebayo Akinfenwa was Liverpool's defence in microcosm. Mignolet flapped hopelessly at George Francomb's corner under pressure, Mamadou Sakho bundled the ball against his own bar and amid the carnage Akinfenwa reacted first. Mignolet, only restored in goal because of an injury to his journeyman deputy Brad Jones, was taunted throughout by AFC Wimbledon fans well-versed in his problems with the ball at his feet. If Liverpool could get their hands on a goalkeeper of quality as a long-term replacement for Mignolet this month surely they will, although it could prove easier said than done. Mignolet may have to do for this season but not beyond. Rodgers works on defensive organisation and is certainly too skilled and confident a coach to bring in an outsider to assist with defence, but that vulnerability must remain a concern. As he pointed out when Arsenal scored at Anfield recently, it is not a matter of coaching or organisation when three one-on-one headers are lost in Liverpool's own penalty area. The current players simply need to be better - or replaced by better players. Much was made of the memories of the original Wimbledon FC's FA Cup Final win against Liverpool at Wembley in 1988 as the sub-plot to this occasion - and it was right that two of the real heroes of that day and the old "Crazy Gang" were on hand for this tie in the shape of goalkeeper and captain Dave Beasant and goalscorer Lawrie Sanchez. This, though, is a different time and a different era - as well as a different club for the fans who have helped the rebirth of AFC Wimbledon after they started the long road back in the Combined Counties League in 2002 before going through five promotions and a return to the Football League in 2011. And this FA Cup night was a credit to the way this club has been reshaped and the passion of those loyal fans. Neil Ardley's team were honest, committed and did themselves and AFC Wimbledon proud on their big night. There are still further steps for AFC Wimbledon to take, perhaps even back to their old Plough Lane home, but for now this is a good news story for everyone involved. The FA Cup provides tales to tell for all involved - not just for clubs but for the media following the progress of this wonderful competition. Sunday's tie between Yeovil Town and Manchester United involved a temporary home in the front row of The Screwfix Community Stand, where you could almost reach out and touch the action at ground level. Cut to Cherry Red Records Stadium a short walk from Norbiton Station 24 hours later and home was a specially built overflow press box in a corner of the stadium, access gained by climbing a rather shaky ladder. All good fun - especially for the unsporting AFC Wimbledon fans who subjected Her Majesty's Media to (to put it politely) to catcalls as they made an inelegant exit down the ladder before leaving to hear from Neal Ardley and Brendan Rodgers. The chants of 'You don't know what you're doing" were not entirely inaccurate but given (and taken) in good part. The FA Cup third round is still one of the great dates in English football's calendar - and anyone wishing to argue against that could not have been present at Yeovil or AFC Wimbledon.	When Steven Gerrard suffered a rare blemish in the middle of his latest masterclass, AFC Wimbledon's fans pounced on the topic that will dominate Liverpool's agenda between now and the day he takes his leave.
Eugenijus Tulauskas, from Lithuania, was up to four times over the maritime limit when arrested in September last year. A pilot had to take control of the container ship to ensure its safe passage into harbour. The 44-year-old seaman, of no fixed abode was fined Â£1,500 at Belfast Magistrates' Court. Tulauskas had contested a charge of having excess alcohol while on duty as professional master of a ship. His lawyers argued that he was not on duty at the time of the offence. The court was told that an experienced pilot sent out to guide the ship into port thought he smelled alcohol on Tulauskas' breath. He contacted Belfast Harbour Police who detained the defendant and took a breath sample. Talauskas confirmed at that stage he had not taken any alcohol in the previous four hours. The district judge said she was "satisfied on the evidence that the defendant was not just master of the vessel, but was on duty at the time". Talauskas' lawyer argued that he was aware of the pilot's actions and had congratulated him on his manoeuvres. "It's not a case that he was totally incoherent," the lawyer said. The court heard that the captain had since lost his job. The judge, who could have fined him up to Â£5,000, commented that "if the defendant were in employment I would be looking at the upper region (of a fine)".	A sea captain has been convicted of being drunk in charge of a merchant ship in Belfast Lough.
But many of the people using the health service in England or Northern Ireland on Monday morning may not have noticed a huge difference. Why? Walkouts in the NHS are quite different from other sectors. When tube drivers, council staff or teachers strike the aim is to cause disruption. It is the first rule of industrial action: make your contribution count. However, the terms of engagement are somewhat different when NHS workers take part. While unions members want to make a point, they commit to not harming urgent and emergency services. Ahead of this week's action local union officials held talks with managers to plan services - as they did before the walkout on 17 October. It means there are likely to have been many staff in work who supported the strike but have agreed to keep working. Midwives are a classic example of this. The Royal College of Midwives has promised to keep maternity units running and so well over half of their members are believed to have worked. And even where staff have walked out, there appears to have been a willingness to leave the picket lines when there has been a need. In a word, pay. Ministers in England and Northern Ireland have awarded NHS staff a 1% increase, but only for those without automatic progression-in-the-job rises. These, designed to reward professional development, are given to about half of staff and are worth 3% a year on average. What is more, the offer is "non-consolidated", which means it is taken away at the end of the year, meaning their pay packet returns back to the 2013-14 level, and does not count towards staff pensions. An independent pay review board had said the 1% increase should be across the board and paid in full as normal. Next year it has been suggested those not getting a progression-in-the job rise get 2%, but again it should be non-consolidated. But in Scotland a 1% pay rise was given to everyone and in Wales a deal was reached last week after ministers agreed to pay 1% next year, while giving extra help to the lowest paid this year. It means the disruption during both strikes seems to have been limited to areas such as outpatient appointments and community clinics. And it is why unions are able to claim strong support for the walkout, while NHS England releases figures suggesting only about 12,500 staff - about one in 35 - did not turn up for work. But with the strike now ended, attention turns to what happens next. The simple answer is a period of work-to-rule. Members from the nine unions involved in the walkout are expected to take steps such as refusing to do unpaid overtime and insisting on taking their breaks. They may be joined by another two unions. However, as far as an end to this dispute, a solution seems some way off. As the walkout was coming to an end, unions were already telling me they would be sitting down to discuss future action. There was a meeting between the strike in October and this one, but it is thought little progress was made with the government maintaining giving a 1% pay rise on top of the progression-in-the-job pay rises was simply not affordable. Unions have been told that they are free to come up with another solution, but that there is no more money for pay. That means making some kind of compromise on the progression-in-the-job element. These can be extremely lucrative - for senior nurses and midwives they are worth ??10,000 - so understandably staff are unwilling to give them up. But to understand the cause of this dispute you really need to go back to 2009. That was the year the then NHS chief executive Sir David Nicholson set the health service an ambitious savings target. The NHS was told to save ??20bn by 2014 - later pushed back to 2015. Sir David was adamant, though, it could not simply be achieved through cuts, but rather it had to come from efficiency savings. It works out as a productivity gain of between 4% and 5% a year - something the health service had never done before. Unsurprisingly, it has turned out to be just as difficult as expected. A report by MPs earlier this year showed significant inroads had been made, but the majority of these had not come from efficiency savings. Instead, the NHS had relied on "quick fixes" - namely pay restraint. Over the last four years there have been two years of freezes and two of small rises. That has had a significant impact on the pockets of health workers. Figures from Unison suggest health worker pay has fallen by 10% during this period once inflation is taken into account. But it is easy to understand - in simple money terms at least - why ministers have adopted such an approach. About 40% of the budget is spent on pay and with the NHS facing a ??30bn hole in its finances by 2020, the government is under pressure to make resources stretch as far as they can. That said, ministers know they face a tricky dilemma. Governments tend to avoid getting into disputes with health workers - public opinion normally sides with them - and so a lengthy period of industrial action ahead of an election will be something ministers will be keen to avoid. Like all pay disputes, it promises to be a game of brinkmanship. But one in which the stakes could not be higher.	The words strike and NHS are enough to send a shudder down the spine of any patient.
Some operations have been cancelled and extra staff drafted in to deal with a surge of patients over the weekend. The Bristol Royal Infirmary, Southmead Hospital and Weston General hospitals are affected. More beds are being opened but people are urged not to go to A&E unless they have a "life-threatening" condition. Instead they are urged to go to minor injury units, chemists and GP surgeries, or to call the NHS on 111. A black alert, the highest level, means hospital services are unable to cope with demand. The three hospitals were last on black alert earlier this month. The number of people in hospital for more than two weeks is much higher than usual, said an NHS spokesman. A surge of patients during last week's cold snap has added to pressure. The black alert is likely to stay in place for days. Extra ambulance staff are being used to transfer patients into hospital, to prevent ambulances queuing and district nurses are being deployed to hospitals, to help find community beds for patients well enough to leave. Bristol GP Peter Goyder said an increase in hospital admissions together with "a higher number of very ill patients who need to stay in hospital for longer" had contributed to the situation. Analysis of the most recent figures suggests hospitals in England are struggling to meet the four-hour target for treating or admitting 95% of patients. Three hospitals in Cornwall also went on black alert this month, as did two in Somerset.	Hospitals with A&E departments around Bristol are back on black alert for the second time in a month amid "severe pressure" on services.
Ch Insp David Pettigrew believes the cameras would act as a deterrent to disorder and vandalism. Glasgow City Council said the implementation of cameras had been explored but the topography of the site made it difficult. The Glasgow Necropolis is a historic cemetery and tourist attraction. The 37-acre Victorian cemetery, east of the city centre, contains about 3,500 monuments and sculptures. Ch Insp Pettigrew, the officer in charge of the Necropolis area, told the BBC: "At this time of year, it is not the same as the spring and summer months. This is an area where people come to drink. They do that because it is out the way. "That brings with it anti-social behaviours and disorder, whether deliberate or otherwise. It damages the headstones as well, so there is a clearly a disrespectful aspect to that. The headstones have been here for hundreds of years and can be loose, and if they fall over they can cause serious injury. "Primarily, we are talking about drinking in the Necropolis. Gang activity in the east end in general is very much in the decline in recent years." Ch Insp Pettigrew said police officers take part in regular patrols of the necropolis during the spring and summer months, supported by teams from Community Safety Glasgow, who work in close consultation with the city council. The senior officer said the teams from Community Safety sometimes patrol the area with mobile CCTV vans but he would like to see this taken a step further. He added: "CCTV has proven to be an effective aide to policing in many other parts of the city, so I think it would go without saying that it would be a benefit to this area also. "The cameras themselves act as a deterrent because when people know they are here, they clearly don't have the same advantage as being able to hide behind a bush or a tree, but in the event that something happens it gives us the opportunity to find the people responsible. Quite clearly, we cannot be here 24 hours a day." Police Scotland told the BBC they only received six reports of crime at the necropolis between April and August 2015 - four of vandalism, one breach of the peace and once incidence of drinking in a public place. Three people were reported to the procurator fiscal over these incidents. The Friends of Glasgow Necropolis are a group of volunteers who conduct tours of the cemetery, and raise money for conservation and restoration work at the Necropolis. Ruth Johnston, the group's chairwoman, said: "I don't think it (anti-social behaviour at the Necropolis) is any different from a large park in a very large city. We bring a lot of tourists here. "People feel very safe coming in here, and there wouldn't be so many people coming if they didn't feel safe. "The Glasgow Necropolis is incredibly inspiring, no matter what your interests are - history, social history, archaeology, architecture, sculpture. Some of the most famous sculptors have done work here." Alexander "Greek" Thomson and Charles Rennie Mackintosh are among those whose work is at the Necropolis, while William Miller - the man who wrote the Wee Willie Winkie nursery rhyme - is also buried there. A memorial for Glasgow firefighters is one of 3,500 in the cemetery, with an estimated 50,000 people buried at the site in total. Next year, the Friends of Glasgow Necropolis hopes to raise Â£60,000 for the restoration of the Monteith mausoleum, and they will continue commemorations for those who died in World War One and other conflicts. A spokesman for Glasgow City Council said: "Community Safety Glasgow currently deploy two daily security patrols, staggered day and night, to the Necropolis and random mobile CCTV patrols are also conducted in the area to deter and detect antisocial behaviour. Foot patrols are also carried out within the Necropolis to deter dog fouling. "There are also quarterly meetings between Police Scotland, the council, Community Safety Glasgow and the Friends of the Necropolis group to discuss any issues. "The possibility of using re-deployable CCTV in the Necropolis was also explored, but the topography of the site made it difficult in terms of radio signalling." A spokesperson for Historic Environment Scotland, which is a statutory consultee for the Glasgow Necropolis, added: "We are aware that there has been an issue with vandalism and anti-social behaviour at Glasgow Necropolis. "Whilst we are not aware of any recent requests to Glasgow City Council planning department regarding the potential installation of CCTV we would be happy to discuss this and other proposals for improving security within the grounds of the Necropolis with them. "Public security measures such as CCTV are not uncommon practice within other historic sites and buildings and we would work with the applicant to discuss possible options."	A senior police officer has called for CCTV cameras to be installed at the Glasgow Necropolis to help keep the area free of antisocial behaviour.
Media playback is not supported on this device Wednesday's 3-0 defeat at Sunderland was the second time they have conceded three goals since losing to Manchester United at Wembley on 23 April. Everton are 12th in the table with one win from their past 10 league games. "We tried to get the focus after being in the FA Cup semi-final and sometimes it drops the intensity," said Martinez. Martinez has come under pressure from some Everton fans this season, while Ajax manager Frank de Boer and Southampton boss Ronald Koeman have been linked with his job this month. Patrick van Aanholt's free-kick and two close-range strikes from Lamine Kone sealed a comfortable win for Sunderland at the Stadium of Light which secured their survival and relegated Newcastle and Norwich. Spaniard Martinez, who took over from David Moyes in June 2013 and signed a new five-year contract in 2014, added: "The effort we put in deserved a lot more. "It was not an easy game and Sunderland had a lot of momentum with their focus on the league. "We have one more game to get the winning feeling and perform in a manner in which we can get the three points and end the season better." Everton finished fifth in the table with a record Premier League points tally in their first season under Martinez in 2013-14, and 11th the following year. They end their campaign at home to Norwich on Sunday.	Manager Roberto Martinez says Everton have struggled to focus on the Premier League following their FA Cup semi-final defeat.
It will add an extra 600 seats a day for commuters into the Welsh capital after being criticised for having too many overcrowded trains. Arriva Trains Wales, whose Wales and Borders franchise expires in 2018, is adding morning weekday services into Cardiff Central from Barry and Radyr. Economy minister Ken Skates had said Arriva's profits were "too high." The Wales and Borders franchise - which is one of the UK's most heavily subsidised, receiving between Â£110m-Â£160m a year - has seen passenger numbers rise from 18 million in 2003 to 30 million. About 265,000 people use Cardiff Central station weekly and a BBC investigation found overcrowding in Cardiff stations during the morning commute was rising at a faster rate than anywhere else outside London, according to figures from the Department for Transport. Arriva Trains Wales now plans to add extra capacity and extra trains from 22 May on the following routes Arriva Trains Wales said the additional trains were "subject to railway approval processes" but the announcement is "one of the most significant improvements to valleys commuters in a decade". It said to implement the changes, the operator "needed to remove one midday Penarth service and one midday Barry service". The firm has a zero growth contract - which means it has the same number of trains it had when it began operations in 2003. It said the additions "would not have been possible" without Network Rail's recent Â£300m signalling upgrade works and new platform eight at Cardiff Central. "This is one of the most significant improvements to valleys commuters in a decade, since the opening of the Ebbw Vale line," said Arriva Trains Wales customer services director, Lynne Milligan. "With only a limited number of trains in our fleet and the lack of availability in the UK we have had to work hard to get the most from what we've got." Network Rail Wales said "more trains are travelling through Cardiff than ever before".	Capacity on the "busiest trains" into Cardiff will double from May, Arriva Trains Wales has said.
Defender Fabio Da Silva is closing in on a Premier League return with promoted Middlesbrough. He could be followed out of the exit door if acceptable bids are made. "We don't want to lose anyone in the group, but [at] any club apart from the top ones, every player has their price and you have buy-out clauses," he said. "In terms of players going, the Fabio one has been well-documented but nothing has changed on that, it is an ongoing process. "Obviously there are a few players at the club we are willing to listen to offers for and that won't change between now and the end of the window. "We talk about it as a club, as a head coach I get a very big say in that, but like any club, players have their prices and if clubs reach that price and turn the players' head, it is very difficult. "If players have high offers, obviously you listen to those offers." Trollope, who has left the Welsh coaching set-up to focus on his managerial career, says he has spoken with defender Jazz Richards. Richards, formerly a Swansea player, was booed by Cardiff supporters in their season opener at Birmingham for his apparent reluctance to 'do the Ayattolah' - a cult Cardiff celebration which involved tapping your head with both hands. Cardiff even went to the lengths of releasing footage that showed Richards did do the celebration at St Andrews. Trollope told BBC Radio Wales Sport that he does expect Richards to "respect the club's traditions." "I spoke to Jazz, he is aware of the club's traditions and obligations and it is something that happened during the game that I was not aware of," Trollope explained. "We have got evidence and he assures us that he did it, which I think some of the supporters saw. "But moving forward I don't think it will be a problem. "He performed at a good level for us on Saturday, we were pleased with his contribution, but we don't need these things going on around it. "He's aware of our expectations. He was focused on the game and he did it, that's the main thing and it is a learning curve for him for the next games as to what he should be doing." Cardiff travel to Trollope's former club Bristol Rovers tomorrow night for a clash in the first round of the EFL Cup.	Head coach Paul Trollope says every player at Cardiff City "has their price," before the transfer window closes.
Torquing Group was criticised for a lack of communication over the Zano after the project folded last week. An apology has been issued along with the new information. The collapse of Zano caused embarrassment for Kickstarter when many disappointed backers questioned whether they would get their money back. In the new update, which was published to the project's Kickstarter page, the firm detailed how its funding had been apportioned across the project. The four largest areas to which more than £2.3m in donations had been distributed as follows: Developing improvements to the Zano prototype had been one significant example of expenditure, the company said. "Ultimately these upgrades coupled with delays caused by the creation of a bespoke and automatic testing rig had significant financial and timeline impacts upon the project," the statement added. The firm also reiterated its intention to "co-operate fully" with Trading Standards within Pembrokeshire County Council. In a closing comment, Torquing added an additional apology: "We would like to make a sincere apology for the understandable disappointment felt by all of those that have supported the project." The BBC had also learned that Kickstarter had contacted Zano backers following the announcement of Zano's collapse last week. "Like you, we're extremely frustrated by what's happened with this project," the message said. It added that Kickstarter had asked Torquing to provide a more detailed update to backers by November 30 - or Kickstarter would pursue an inquiry into the Zano project.	The company behind the failed mini-drone Zano has provided some details of how more than £2.3m in funding was allocated.
Kester David, 53, from Wood Green, was found badly burned under a bridge in Palmers Green in 2010. Police made a fresh appeal for information about his death last year. On Monday the police said they had closed the reinvestigation and that the Met commissioner had met Mr David's family to apologise personally. Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said: "There were obviously some things that should have been done by those officers, which quite simply were not. "It is also completely unacceptable that a grieving family were treated with such insensitivity." His family have always maintained he was killed for working as a police informant and have claimed police failed to look at CCTV or speak to witnesses promptly. The initial investigation by Scotland Yard into Mr Kester's death concluded he committed suicide. A year later an internal investigation, led by inspector Brian Casson, found a "catalogue of errors" and a "failing in duty" as full CCTV and mobile phone records were not checked and witnesses were not interviewed. Sir Bernard insisted that the reinvestigation, now closed by the Met, was "thorough and explored every single line of enquiry open to us". Detectives concluded there was no evidence or information that a third party was involved in his death. Despite a number of appeals during the reinvestigation made to local and national media and on BBC Crimewatch, no arrests were ever made in connection with his death.	Scotland Yard has apologised to the family of a police informant for "shortcomings" in the original investigation into his death.
Theresa May told the Commons it was a 100% failure rate, as all of the samples submitted so far since the Grenfell Tower fire had failed. She urged local authorities and housing associations to "get on with the fire safety checks". At least 79 people are feared to have been killed in the blaze on 14 June. Meanwhile, regulator NHS Improvement said it has written to all NHS trusts and foundation trusts  to ask them to carry out urgent fire safety checks. There are 36 organisations that need additional support to find out if they have cladding similar to Grenfell, it said, and fire safety tests on building material is expected to be completed "by early next week". Mrs May told MPs that she expects to name a judge to head the public inquiry into the disaster soon. She said 282 temporary properties had been identified for residents of the tower, 132 families have had their needs assessed and there have been 65 offers of temporary accommodation. The government has made almost Â£1.25m of discretionary payments and will be giving an extra Â£1m to a local group of charities, trusts and foundations, Mrs May said. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the tragedy had "exposed the disastrous effect of austerity" and said: "Fewer inspectors, fewer building control inspectors, fewer planning inspectors - we all pay a price." The blaze, which started in a fridge-freezer, destroyed 151 homes in the north Kensington block and in the surrounding area of the London Borough of Kensington and Chelsea. Questions were raised about the cladding used on Grenfell in the immediate aftermath of the disaster and a nation-wide operation has taken place to identify and test buildings with similar cladding. It has emerged that London Fire Brigade issued a warning to all 33 London councils about panels attached to the exterior of buildings in May this year, in a letter seen by the BBC. On Tuesday, Mrs May said there should be a "major national investigation" into the use of cladding on high-rise towers.	Cladding from 120 high-rise buildings in 37 local authority areas in England has now failed fire safety tests, the prime minister has said.
Guards at the site saw the pair pick up the items from the ground, the judge at a court in Krakow was told. The pupils, from the independent Perse School in Cambridge, say they picked them up to show their guide. They deny stealing artefacts of special cultural importance during a school visit in June 2015. The court in Krakow heard the items were found on the students by police. The pupils were in an area of the Nazi death camp where the belongings of Jews who were sent to the gas chambers were kept, the court was told. The court heard police also found a fragments of a spoon and glass on the pair, who were 17 at the time. Initially they pleaded guilty to the charge and accepted a fine, but once back in the UK they changed their pleas. If found guilty, they face prison sentences of up to 10 years. The Nazis murdered 1.1 million people at Auschwitz in occupied Poland during World War Two. The trial continues.	Two British teenagers stole items including buttons and a rusted hair clipper from the Auschwitz death camp, a court in Poland has heard.
The rate hit 5.1% in the three months to November - its lowest rate since the three months to October 2005, according to the Office for National Statistics. The number of people out of work fell by 99,000 to 1.68 million in the three-month period. Average weekly earnings, including bonuses, were up 2%, the slowest increase since February. The 2% growth in wages was below the 2.1% growth forecast in a Reuters survey. Excluding bonuses, average weekly earnings growth slowed to 1.9% in the three months, the ONS said. The figures show that the employment rate hit 74% - the highest since comparable records began in 1971. The figures come a day after Bank of England governor Mark Carney ruled out an early rise in interest rates because of the turmoil in the global economy and weaker UK growth. A sustained improvement in wage growth was one of the factors he said would help the Bank to gauge when to raise rates. He has previously said he would like to see earnings growth at above 3% a year before rates are increased. Capital Economics economist Ruth Miller said the figures confirmed an interest rate hike "is still some way off". "There still seems very little inflationary pressure coming from the labour market," she added. Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, the forecasting body of accountancy firm EY, said the jobless rate was now below the pre-crisis average of 5.2%, yet it had not triggered excessive pay growth: "The latest pay numbers will exacerbate concerns raised in recent MPC meetings that very low inflation may be pushing down pay settlements, threatening a negative feedback between wages and prices. "That the first post-crisis rate hike may be pushed back into 2017 is looking an ever-more realistic possibility." The latest ONS figures show that almost 23 million people are now in a full-time job, 436,000 more than a year earlier, while 8.4 million are working part-time, up by 152,000. The number of workers in part-time jobs wanting a full-time post is 1.2 million, down by 21,000 in the latest three months. Economic inactivity, counting people on long-term sick leave, looking after a relative or who have given up looking for work, fell by 93,000 to just under nine million, the lowest since the spring of 2014. The inactivity rate for women reached a record low of 27%. The figures for unemployment in the three months to the end of November are based on the Labour Force Survey, in which the ONS speaks to 40,000 households once a quarter, making it the country's biggest household survey. The ONS is 95% confident that the figure of a 5.1% rate of unemployment is correct to plus or minus 0.2 percentage points - in other words, it's between 4.9% and 5.3%.	The UK unemployment rate has fallen to its lowest rate in more than a decade but wage growth has slowed.
Ian Brown, 44, and Daniel Dunkley, 35, took their own lives at HMP Woodhill last July. Their relatives claimed Woodhill's governor had not complied fully with Prison Service Instructions (PSIs). The governor and Justice Secretary Liz Truss said the judicial review claim was "neither appropriate or necessary". PSIs cover management of prisoners at risk of harm to themselves, to others and from others, early days in custody and medical emergency response codes. Heather Williams QC, for the families, said the claim addressed what she said was an "exceptionally high" rate of self-inflicted deaths at the Milton Keynes prison. Seven prisoners killed themselves last year, five in 2015, with 18 in total since May 2013. Ms Williams said the case raised serious ongoing breaches of Article 2 of the Human Rights Act, which protects the right to life, and involved long-term failures to comply with the responsibility placed on the authorities to protect prisoners. James Strachan QC, defending, said: "Not only have the governor and the secretary of state taken significant action in 2016 to improve the situation, but this is a continuing high priority." Lord Justice Irwin and Mr Justice Garnham rejected the judicial review claim. In their ruling, they said the families had failed to establish a "systemic failing". Mr Justice Garnham said: "The defendants have made it clear that they share the great concern of the claimants about the rate of suicides in prisons generally, and HMP Woodhill in particular. "They have in place sensible and satisfactory policies. "The defendants have acknowledged that, on occasions, operational errors have been made by their staff in dealing with those at risk of suicide and have sought to prevent those mistakes being repeated."	Families of two men who died in prison have lost a High Court case related to the high rate of suicides there.
"We know solution for everything, but not terrorism. I am happy that Bangladesh Prime Minister, despite being a woman, has declared zero tolerance for terrorism," the PM said in his hour-long address to Dhaka University at the weekend. Analysts say Mr Modi may have been trying to highlight the importance of "women power" in politics, but he could have chosen better words. His latest "gaffe" has led to the top-trending "despitebeingawoman" hashtag on Twitter. Many Twitter users are highlighting what they have achieved "despite being a woman". While some have shown anger in their reactions, others have chosen sarcasm to comment on the situation. But there are others who see "no harm" in Mr Modi's remarks. Some have suggested that Mr Modi's team needs to be more careful while preparing his statements and speeches at home and abroad. Foreign policy analysts had criticised Mr Modi's veiled criticism of China during his visit to Japan in September last year. And his remarks in South Korea last month about migration had sparked a Twitter backlash at home. Dr Athar Zafar of the Indian Council of World Affairs, a foreign policy think tank, says Mr Modi is certainly keen on improving India's relations with the world. "But he needs to choose his words carefully. His intentions may be right, but the message gets lost if wrong words are used," he says. Dr Zafar adds that Mr Modi's foreign policy achievements get lost in the noise about his "politically incorrect statements". "This is something he needs to change if he wants more Indians to talk about his foreign visits and not such gaffes," he adds.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's latest remark about Bangladeshi PM Sheikh Hasina's political achievements is attracting criticism and humour in equal measure on social media, reports BBC Monitoring.
Mrs Schlafly was an outspoken opponent of feminism and abortion and helped Republicans block the Equal Rights Amendment in the 1970s. She campaigned against Communism and is credited with creating the political climate that helped Ronald Reagan become president. Mrs Schlafly publicly endorsed Donald Trump at a rally in March. Paying tribute to her on Monday, the Republican presidential candidate described Mrs Schlafly as "a patriot, a champion for women and a symbol of strength". Mrs Schlafly's death, in St Louis, was announced by the Eagle Forum, a conservative group she founded in 1972. It described her as an "iconic  American leader whose love for America was surpassed only by her love of God and her family". Mrs Schlafly was a strong advocate of traditional family values and one of her crowning political victories was helping to stop the Equal Rights Amendment [ERA] from being added to the US Constitution. She once described feminists as "a bunch of bitter women seeking a constitutional cure for their personal problems". Donald T Critchlow, author of a biography of Phyllis Schlafly, said that defeating the ERA helped to usher in a new conservative era in US politics, paving the way for Ronald Reagan's election in 1980. The Eagle Forum said Mrs Schlafly was survived by her six children, 16 grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.	Phyllis Schlafly, a leading figure in the US conservative movement, has died at her home in Missouri, aged 92.
The vote held on Friday was for 68 seats out of the 290 in parliament. It meant that nervous Iranians woke up on Saturday morning to an all new political landscape. For the first time in 13 years moderates and reformists now have a majority in parliament. While it was not a sweeping victory for the supporters of President Hassan Rouhani, it was still a surprise win, especially given the months of heavy campaigning against the government's policies. Hardliners had a majority in the outgoing parliament. In the three years since Hassan Rouhani took office, they have bitterly opposed most of government's plans, organising a fierce attack on the nuclear deal between Iran and world powers. Some MPs have even gone so far as to describe Foreign Minister Javad Zarif as a traitor. The popular moderate who negotiated the nuclear deal has regularly been subject to harsh criticism in parliament and is under constant threat of impeachment by fundamentalist MPs. Now almost all those MPs have been unseated by moderate or reformist counterparts, and those who remain either supported the deal or at least never attacked it as vociferously as their unseated comrades. Many observers argue the nuclear deal not only brought an end to years of harsh international sanctions but was also the deal-breaker in the elections. The people were saying no to those who had promised to stop the deal. What puts this victory in a more meaningful context is the fact that it was achieved despite almost all well-known reformists being banned from running in the elections and a complete lack of media coverage of their campaign in the run-up to the elections. State TV and media never gave equal coverage to reformists or moderate candidates and even led a campaign against the deal in recent months. The only medium available to pro-government candidates was the internet and social media, which they used to the maximum in getting their message across, especially to the young and women. The triumph of the reformists should lead to a major realignment within parliament, making it more supportive of President Rouhani. But it will by no means end the president's problems when it comes to delivering his election promises. The nuclear deal has hit some rough patches on its way to implementation. Apart from domestic oppositions from hardliners in parliament and other unelected bodies, there are still a lot of obstacles to overcome outside of Iran. The international banks still have not opened up to Iranian businesses and in the US, conservatives in Congress are doing all they can to derail the deal. Any more delays in its implementation and ensuing lifting of sanctions would harm President Rouhani's economic reform plans and would prepare the ground for hardliners to recover from the this week's defeat in order to reshape their campaign against the government. Time is not on the moderates' side and the new momentum could die down easily if it is not supported by economic rewards. This is a worry that every unseated hardliner MP is focusing on from now onwards.	The run-off parliamentary election win by the moderate government of Iran is a crucial victory for them.
Sidwell, 34, has made 32 Championship appearances this season to help the Seagulls achieve promotion to the top flight for the first time in 34 years. With his contract due to expire at the end of the campaign, the midfielder is now hoping to sign a new deal. "I want to be a part of it next year because I know we can stay in the Premier League," he said. Brighton's recent win over Wigan confirmed their promotion, and with a four-point lead over second-placed Newcastle, Chris Hughton's side are now hoping to wrap up the league title in the final two matches. Sidwell made 19 appearances for Albion on loan from Stoke during 2015-16 before signing a one-year deal with Brighton in June 2016. He has previously played in the Premier League with Reading, Chelsea, Aston Villa, Fulham and Stoke and believes he deserves the opportunity to play at the top level again. Sidwell told BBC Radio Sussex: "When I signed the contract last year no-one expected me to play as many games as I have. I've probably given a better impact than expected. "When I have played I've played well, I've put my best foot forward and I've given myself every opportunity to earn a new deal. "If there's one on the table then hopefully we can thrash it out, it can be done and we can enjoy the summer."	Steve Sidwell says he has done all he can to earn a new Brighton contract and play in the Premier League next season.
Edwina Hart accused UK officials of "ignorance" amid suggestions passengers could have to change trains on some services between Wales and England. Responsibility for the Wales and Border network will be devolved in 2017. A Department of Transport spokesman said no decisions would be made without considering local views. Services from Aberystwyth to Birmingham and Milford Haven to Manchester via Cardiff, are among routes which could be affected. In last year's St David's Day agreement, the UK government wrote: "In order for the secretary of state for transport to ensure proper accountability, it is likely that services primarily serving English markets will be placed into other franchises for which the Secretary of State for Transport is the franchising authority". Responding to suggestions some passengers may have to change trains on cross-border routes, Mrs Hart said some Whitehall officials "don't actually understand how things work and what are important". "I base some of their comments on ignorance rather than a conspiracy theory," she said. "We want to ensure those services remain within the franchise." John Rogers from campaign group Railfutures Wales said: "It's ludicrous, it's impractical, it's being done behind the scenes with a lot of secrecy initially and we're determined to fight it". "It's not in the interests of passengers.  People hate changing trains, it's a deterrent and it would affect the tourist industry," he added. A Department for Transport spokesman said: "We are working closely with the Welsh government to develop plans for cross-border routes and stations as we move towards devolving the next Wales and Border franchise".	Claims direct cross-border rail services could be under threat due to devolution have been dismissed by Wales' transport minister.
Sue Sim was the first woman to lead the force and led the hunt for murderer Raoul Moat in 2010. Last month Northumbria Police and Crime Commissioner Vera Baird launched an investigation into Ms Sim over alleged rudeness to staff. Ms Sim is retiring on 3 June to spend more time with her family to "make up for the sacrifices" they made. She joined Merseyside Police in 1985, progressing through the ranks before moving to Northumbria in 2004. Ms Sim said the hunt for Moat following the murder of Christopher Brown and shooting of one of her officers, PC David Rathband, was one of the biggest challenges she faced. She said: "That was the largest manhunt the country has seen for 44 years. I spent my time out and about reassuring the public and responding to their questions. "I am immensely proud of my officers and staff who went about their roles fully aware of the threats against them, but determined to support the public." She has also overseen savings of Â£117m since 2010 and was at the helm as Northumbria Police reopened no crime rape reports following an audit. Ms Baird's office said the misconduct investigation will continue but admitted if the complaints against her were upheld, Ms Sim's retirement would mean any sanctions, such as a written warning, would have no impact. Ms Baird said: "Sue has brought passion and enthusiasm to her role and leaves at a time when Northumbria is one of the highest performing forces in the country."	The chief constable of Northumbria Police will retire after 30 years of service, it has been announced.
The identity of the bodies is not clear, but one of the bodies is suspected to be that of a woman who was reported missing a week ago. The bodies were found by a herder looking for his animals, who noticed signs of wild jackals in the area near the Somali border. Kenya's security forces deny charges they have been killing ethnic Somalis. The residents of ethnic Somali-dominated districts in the region have repeatedly accused Kenya's security agencies of being behind the arrest and disappearance of youths suspected to have links with Somali militant Islamist group al-Shabab. Since the reports emerged, the hashtag #StopKillingSomalis has been trending in Kenya. The BBC's Ferdinand Omondi in Nairobi said disturbing images circulated on social media on Monday morning, showing human body parts sticking out of poorly dug trenches. A woman's mutilated body provoked the strongest reaction. She is thought to be a mother of five, arrested four days ago. Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet confirmed the woman's death, but denied the existence of mass graves. Area senator Billow Kerrow suggested the dead were victims of enforced disappearances. A report last year by campaign group Human Rights Watch said there was strong evidence that Kenya's Anti-Terrorism Police Unit has carried out a series of extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances in the region. Kenya's security forces deny the allegation. Kenya has thousands of troops fighting al-Shabab in Somalia. The militant group says this is why it has staged several deadly attacks in Kenya in recent years.	People living in north-east Kenya say they have discovered at least 20 bodies buried in shallow graves.
Nigerian Keshi, who died suddenly aged 54, was appointed head coach of Togo three times between 2004 and 2011. The match in Lome was played between the current Togo national side and 'Team Keshi', made up of players who were part of his 2006 squad. "Keshi was like a big brother for me," said striker Emmanuel Adebayor, who played for Team Keshi. "He was somebody that I respected a lot and I have to give him a lot of credit because when he joined the Togolese national team he believed in me. "He was for the first time looking into my eyes and told me how good I was and how good I could become. "I just listened to his advice because he was a former footballer. Listening to his advice helped me a lot and today I am where I am because of that of that. "May his soul rest in a perfect peace and let's us keep on remembering him in our prayers." Keshi will be most widely remembered for his feats with Nigeria, both as an Africa Cup of Nations-winning player and coach. But he also will be associated deeply with Togo, who gave him his first coaching job - and he pulled off a remarkable achievement to qualify them for the 2006 World Cup finals, ahead of Senegal and Zambia. However, he was sacked by Togo just a few months before the tournament in Germany. Keshi returned for two more spells  - appointed in 2007 and 2001 - but was unable to repeat his earlier success with the Hawks. More than 20,000 fans were in attendance at the Ominsports stadium in Lome to watch the game, which finished 6-2 to the current Togo national side. After the match. Adebayor told the crowd: "I would like to pay tribute to him and I hope that the family he left behind will find the needed faith and strength to overcome this period." Abalo Dosseh, deputy coach and former captain of Togo, told BBC Sport: "It is an honour for me to stand on this pitch in remembrance of Big Boss. He has done a lot for Togolese football and the entire continent. "I always remember the day I asked to captain the team for the first time and we were also lucky to make the same year to the World Cup. "All the former players and others who are still playing have come to pay tribute to him." Toglose former player Olufade Adekambi, who also played alongside Keshi, added: "We thank God that  he did many good things for Togo. We are still mourning him  because he was like a big brother, a coach and a big man."	Togo honoured former coach Stephen Keshi, who died in June, by playing a tribute match on Sunday.
Massaro will take on Perry in the first all-English women's final since 1991 after beating top seed Nour El Sherbini of Egypt 5-11 7-11 11-5 11-3 11-6. Perry then upset Malaysia's five-time champion and sixth seed Nicol David 11-8 7-11 13-11 11-7. Matthew beat Egypt's top seed Mohamed Elshorbagy 11-8 11-8 8-11 11-5. He will face Frenchman Gregory Gaultier in Sunday's final in Hull after the third seed led 11-9 when Egypt's Ramy Ashour retired. Fifth seed and 2013 winner Massaro looked to be heading out when she trailed reigning champion El Sherbini by two games. However, the 33-year-old from Chorley fought back to win in 63 minutes - reversing last year's World final, when she lost to the same opponent from two games up. "I'm just proud of myself that I lived to see another day," she told PSA World Tour. "I'm really pleased, a chance to play again at home. I love coming here. A British Open final is where you want to be." Perry, seeded seventh, was playing in her first British Open semi-final but led from the front against eight-time world champion David. "I'm really proud of the way I fought, even when it was really tight, and I'll just be trying to do the same again tomorrow," said the 26-year-old from Birmingham. "There's no pressure on me. I'm not just here to make up the numbers, I'm here to try and win these tournaments." Matthew, from Sheffield, is closing in on a fourth world title after a brilliant win over Elshorbagy, who had been hoping to claim his third successive British Open. "I was trying not to let the adrenaline get to me, I could feel my heart beating through my head knowing the crowd were cheering," said the 36-year-old. "I felt him wavering at the end which gave me belief."	Laura Massaro, Sarah-Jane Perry and Nick Matthew produced superb performances to give England three of the four finalists at the British Open.
The new charge will be imposed from April 2017 and help ensure that big business shoulders the cost of training workers, George Osborne said. But business groups have described the levy as a new "payroll tax". The Institute of Directors said it would be a big cost for many companies, including medium-sized firms. The CBI said it was a significant extra tax for business that would hit many smaller companies. Only businesses with a wage bill of more than £3m will pay the levy, which the government said would exempt 98% of employers. Mr Osborne told the Commons: "It's a huge reform to raise the skills of the nation and address one of the enduring weaknesses of the British economy." But Institute of Directors director-general Simon Walker said: "We are very concerned by the government's assumption that a quarter of the money collected will be spent on just administering the levy. "Firms have been promised they will get back more than they put in, but it's not clear how this will happen if so much is being lost in bureaucracy." CBI director-general Carolyn Fairbairn said the levy was the sting in the tail for business in the chancellor's statement. The Office for Budget Responsibility, the organisation that compiles forecasts for the government, said that the levy would help reduce wage growth over the next five years by 0.7%. The OBR added: "We assume that most of the cost will ultimately be borne by employees." Chris Sanger, head of tax policy at EY, said the chancellor had tried to sugar-coat the introduction a new tax, which accounted for more than half of the tax rises announced in the Autumn Statement. British Retail Consortium director-general Helen Dickinson said: "The government is absolutely right to want to increase the number of apprenticeships but in doing so it must make sure the quality is increased too." However, Petra Wilton, of the Chartered Management Institute, said: "If businesses want a skilled workforce then it's only right that they pay for it." In other announcements affecting business, £165m of research and development grants distributed through Innovate UK will be turned into loans. The chancellor said this approach had been used successfully in France for years. An Innovate UK spokesman said the change meant that it would "have to focus its work within a new operational funding framework". John Longworth, British Chambers of Commerce director-general, said it was important that replacing grants with loans did not "reduce our dynamism in the global economy". The BCC also welcomed increased spending on infrastructure, particularly for the road network, which it said would help businesses to expand. Support for the aerospace and automotive industries will be maintained at existing levels for the next decade. Paul Everitt, chief executive of ADS Group, which represents aerospace, defence, space and security companies, said the move was "an unprecedented vote of confidence" for the UK aerospace industry. "Long-term funding for aerospace R&D will ensure our industry remains globally competitive and one of the most attractive locations for this high value and high skilled activity," he said. Mr Osborne said the business rate relief scheme would be extended for another year, helping 600,000 small firms. John Allan, chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said its members would be relieved by the extension, although the CBI's Ms Fairbairn added: "Many firms will be disappointed to have been kept hanging on for a much-needed review of business rates until next year's Budget." The BRC said that the High Street retail discount - worth up to £1,500 a year to shops, cafes, pubs and restaurants - had not been renewed in a move that retailers would find "very disappointing". Annual business rates for the average small shop will breach the £9,000 level for the first time next year, according to retail expert Paul Turner-Mitchell. "The Autumn Statement was terrible for both the retail sector and those who have campaigned long and hard for the meaningful structural reform of the system," he said. "It's a real kick in the teeth and the government has just simply not listened." Presented by Chancellor George Osborne, the Spending Review sets out what government spending will be over the next four years, while the Autumn Statement is an annual update of government plans for the economy.

Media playback is not supported on this device The referee stopped the contest at the Titanic Exhibition Centre in the fourth round after the outclassed Slavchev lifted the Belfast man off his feet. Flyweight Barnes, 29, had been on top against the Bulgarian who had lost 24 of 33 previous bouts. Light-flyweight Jamie Conlan beat Hungarian David Koos on points. The Belfast boxer was the victor on a unanimous decision and now awaits a final eliminator for a world title fight. Marco McCullough defeated Luis Ligo in his fight for the vacant WBO Intercontinental featherweight championship when his opponent failed to come off his stool for the fifth round. Barnes's professional bow was much anticipated after a distinguished career in the amateur ranks. "It was hard to pin him down," said Barnes after the strange conclusion. "I was trying too hard to impress. You didn't see the best of me." Earlier, Belfast's Steven Ward, 26, marked his professional debut with a points win over 31-year-old Bulgarian Merdjidin Yuseeinov. Ward, who won silver at the 2010 Commonwealth Games, produced a steady display and was declared the winner by 40 points to 36. Tyrone McKenna won the Celtic super-lightweight belt by stopping Dublin opponent Sean Creagh. Unbeaten McKenna, 26, was well on top when Creagh's corner retired their man before the sixth and final round.	Double Olympic bronze medallist Paddy Barnes won his pro debut fight in unusual circumstances when opponent Stefan Slavchev was disqualified.
The BBC, in collaboration with tech company This Place, has developed a way people can select programmes using a cheap, brainwave-reading headset. The headset works with an experimental version of the BBC's iPlayer on-demand platform. Users can turn on and operate the app by concentrating or relaxing their minds. "It's an internal prototype designed to give our programme makers, technologists and other users an idea of how this technology might be used in future," said Cyrus Saihan, head of business development for the BBC's Digital division. In the first trial, 10 BBC staff tried out the app and were able to launch iPlayer and start viewing a programme via the headset, he said. "It was much easier for some than it was for others, but they all managed to get it to work," said Mr Saihan. This type of technology could be used to help people with a broad range of disabilities who cannot use traditional TV remote controls very easily, Mr Saihan believes. Manipulating electronic devices using brainwaves is becoming more widespread. For example, in February technology firm Tekever demonstrated how a drone could be remotely controlled using brainpower alone. The pilot controlled the aircraft wearing a skullcap embedded with electronic sensors that could read his brain activity. You can watch a video about the iPlayer mind control project here.	If you think controlling your TV with your mind is the stuff of science fiction, think again.
The 32-year-old Irishman is accused of striking Dundee United striker Aidan Connolly in the face with his elbow. Goodwin was not pulled up for the offence during United's 3-0 win. Should he accept the ban, the midfielder would miss three games from 15 November because of an additional suspension due to his recent record. Goodwin has until Wednesday to respond to the complaint, with a hearing set for Thursday. He was banned for two matches last season for elbowing United midfielder Stuart Armstrong. This came after United released their own footage of the incident in the match at St Mirren Park.	St Mirren player-coach Jim Goodwin has been charged by the Scottish FA with violent conduct and offered a two-match suspension.
The NI Composite Economic Index (NICEI) showed growth of 0.3% when compared to the first quarter of the year. Compared to the same period in 2013 the economy has grown by 1.2% The growth is being driven by the services and manufacturing industries while construction output is still falling. Meanwhile, the labour market is continuing to improve with the number of people claiming jobseekers allowance down again in September. The number of claimants was down by 300 to 52,000 - over the last year the number has fallen by  9,400. The quarterly unemployment rate also showed a fall - it was down by  0.5 percentage points for the period June to August 2014 bringing it to 6.1%. That is the lowest quarterly rate since December to February 2009. Enterprise Minister Arlene Foster described the economic data as "encouraging". She said the number of unemployment claimants had now been falling for 21 months, the most sustained decrease since June 1995. She said the NICEI  "also shows evidence of growth in real terms over both the quarter and the year up to quarter two".	Northern Ireland's economy grew slightly in the second quarter of this year, according to the latest official figures.
The teenager was detained at Riverside Retail Park in Coleraine earlier on Thursday. The arrest was made by detectives from the PSNI's Reactive and Organised Crime Branch, who took him to Coleraine police station for questioning. A PSNI spokesman said no further details about the case were being made available at present.	A 14-year-old boy has been arrested in County Londonderry "in connection with serious crime," police have said.
Mr Kaczynski's Law and Justice party never accepted an inquiry that found the Smolensk crash was an accident. The party, which was returned to power in elections last month, accuses Mr Tusk of negligence. He resigned as prime minister last year to become European Council president. Government spokesman Elzbieta Witek said Poland's State Tribunal would be "a good thing" for Mr Tusk, referring to a court that handles cases against elected and other senior officials. She was echoing a call from a government minister, Adam Lipinski, who said the former prime minister had "a lot to answer for" and should be prosecuted after his initial term of office came to an end in Brussels in 2017. On 10 April 2010, 96 Poles were killed when the Tupolev plane they were travelling in went down in thick fog, short of the runway near Smolensk in western Russia. The president, his wife and senior government officials were on their way to Katyn to mark the 70th anniversary of the murder of thousands of Polish officers by Soviet secret police. Separate investigations ruled out any kind of plot, blaming the conditions and poorly trained pilots. Leaked transcripts also indicated the pilots had come under pressure from people on board. Mr Lipinski, a minister in the prime minister's office, told Polish newspaper Super Express that Mr Tusk had "given away" the Smolensk investigation to the Russians, had been negligent in explaining the disaster and had failed to bring back the wreckage to Poland. The Law and Justice party is still run by the late president's brother and identical twin, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, although the prime minister is Beata Szydlo. The government spokeswoman said there was no plan to seek a prosecution against Mr Tusk, insisting it was her private view. But ministers this week shut down the website of the Polish state's Smolensk crash investigation.	A Polish government spokeswoman has called for former Prime Minister Donald Tusk to be put on trial for his handling of the 2010 air disaster in which President Lech Kaczynski died.
A team statement said Henao, 28, had been contacted by cycling's governing body and an anti-doping agency about data between August 2011 and June 2015. The Colombian said he was "beyond disappointed", having missed three months in 2014 over similar concerns. "I know who I am, how hard I have worked and the sacrifices I have made to be where I am today," he added. Henao was voluntarily withdrawn by Team Sky in 2014 while they carried out research into the biological characteristics of riders who live and train at high altitude. They said the results revealed nothing to raise suspicions of wrongdoing. Team Sky stressed Henao had not failed a doping test and had been withdrawn because of the "very obvious distraction to him". "We continue to support Sergio and remain confident in the independent scientific research which was undertaken," the team added. "It is our hope that this can be looked at and resolved quickly by all the relevant authorities so Sergio can start racing again soon." A specialist climber, Henao signed with Team Sky in 2012 and finished in the top 10 in his first Grand Tour, the 2012 Giro d'Italia.	Team Sky have withdrawn Sergio Henao from riding after concerns about his biological passport data resurfaced.
The McLaren driver was already not going to race in F1 in 2017, with the team holding an option on him for the 2018 campaign. But speaking on Thursday, the 36-year-old Briton said: "I go into this weekend thinking it's going to be my last race. I think that's the best way. "At this moment in time, I don't want to be racing in F1 beyond this year." Button, world champion in 2009, made his debut at the age of 20 in 2000. Sunday's race will be his 305th grand prix start, with only Rubens Barrichello (322) and Michael Schumacher (306) having driven in more. He has won 15 F1 races, driving for Williams, Benetton, Renault, BAR, Honda, Brawn and McLaren. Belgian Stoffel Vandoorne is replacing Button at McLaren next year as team-mate to two-time world champion Fernando Alonso, whose contract runs out at the end of 2017, with Button acting as an ambassador for the team. "It is true that I have a contract in 2018 but, at this moment in time, I am not going to be racing in 2018," Button added. "The whole point of this [contract for 2018] was if, in three months' time, I had eaten myself stupid and I changed my mind. "But I don't want to go into this race thinking it's not my last race - and it is." Under his contract for 2017, Button is due to be McLaren's reserve driver and would race if either Alonso or Vandoorne are unable to for any reason. Media playback is not supported on this device He will do promotional work for McLaren and some work in the simulator and attend a minimum of four grands prix. "It's been a long journey since eight years old until now," Button added. "You get to Formula 1 with many dreams and hopefully you leave the sport with memories - some amazing memories, some life-changing, some good, some bad. To walk away with the world championship is very special, too. "I will definitely step away from F1 happy with what I've achieved and definitely my life starts now."	Former world champion Jenson Button says he will retire from Formula 1 after Sunday's Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
A statue of Sekhemka valued at £2m was gifted to Northampton's museums by the 4th Marquis of Northampton in 1880. The Conservative-run council plans to sell it and use the money for heritage schemes but this has been challenged by the Liberal Democrat group. The ruling party said it could not comment during legal talks. The sale was earlier challenged by Lord Northampton, a descendant of the marquis, who said the council did not have the right to sell Sekhemka. The 30in (76cm) limestone figure of a court official clutching beer, bread and cake - items for the afterlife - is believed to have been acquired by Spencer Compton, the second Marquis of Northampton during a trip to Egypt in 1850. It was presented to the museum by his son some years later. The council said the statue's value made it too expensive to insure and secure, and its sale could benefit other local heritage and cultural projects. The Liberal Democrats said the sale should be stopped and the statue ought to remain in Northampton. Council leader David Mackintosh said: "We have made the decision to auction the statue and reinvest the money into our towns culture and heritage. "Our legal team are in contact with Lord Northampton, and it would be inappropriate to comment further." The issue will be discussed at a forthcoming meeting of the council.	Opposition parties on Northampton Borough Council have asked for greater clarity on its plans to sell a 4,000-year-old Egyptian statue.
Corporal William Savage, 30, from Penicuik, Fusilier Samuel Flint, 21, and Private Robert Hetherington, 25, both from Edinburgh, died in the blast. They were killed on Route 611 in the Nahr-e-Saraj district on 30 April 2013. The soldiers, who were in an armoured Mastiff vehicle, were unlawfully killed on active service, the coroner ruled. Coroner, Darren Salter, will now write to Defence Secretary Michael Fallon. The inquest was held at Oxfordshire Coroners Court. Earlier, it heard that an improvised explosive device (IED) had been put in place using a tunnel and was triggered using a command wire from behind the 10ft wall of a nearby compound. Post-mortem examinations concluded the three, who were with B Company, 2nd Battalion, Royal Regiment of Scotland, would have been deeply unconscious virtually instantly and unaware of what had happened. Mr Salter said the Mastiff was designed to resist improvised explosive device (IED) attacks. There had been earlier damage to this one, the second of three evolutions of the vehicle, in a strike in 2009. However, there was "no significant evidence" that the vehicle failed to provide the "expected level of protection", Mr Salter ruled. He also noted that experts referred to the size of the explosion as a "blast overmatch" and that the men were seated in the rear of the vehicle, which was nearest to the explosion. The men died when an improvised explosive device (IED) tore through their heavily armoured Mastiff vehicle on April 30 last year. The Royal Military Police made inquiries to the Afghan National Police about the incident, but no-one was arrested over it. The Mastiff, a protective patrol vehicle, had gone from Forward Operating Base Ouellette to another base at Lashkar Gah Durai and was on its way back again when the attack happened. There were four vehicles in the patrol. The driver of the Mastiff, Fusilier Paul Howell, said in a statement that the regular locks to the rear doors had been faulty, and he had reported them twice. He told the inquest that on the day in question, though they were stiff, they were fully sealed when closed. Extra battle locks were not deployed, but they were not supposed to be when the vehicle was in open desert, only when there were potential public order situations, he said. He said in his statement that there were 20 ammunition tins under the seats in the rear, which was normal. The inquest heard that the IED was buried under the road, had been placed there by tunnelling, and was triggered by a command wire, probably from behind the 10ft wall of a nearby compound. Sgt David Boxwell, who was in command of the patrol, said he had not been told of any problems relating to the place where the blast took place. As for tunnelling under the road, he earlier said: "I had never heard of it before." Company Sgt Major Steven Main said: "Everything we had had was off the tarmac road. IEDs were placed in the dust - it's easier to conceal." He said there was no sign on the ground of the IED. "The wire was so deep that we would not have seen it."	Three soldiers killed in a Taliban bomb blast should have been warned about insurgent activity in the area, a coroner has said.
It effectively completes the four-year-old software's transformation from a "lightweight" chat app, spun off from the main Facebook site, into a fully-fledged "platform" of its own. More than 40 new add-on apps have already been developed so far. But one expert said there was a risk Messenger would become bloated. Messenger has already proved controversial with some users of the social network, who have complained about having to switch between two apps to stay in touch with their Facebook friends. Facebook's founder Mark Zuckerberg announced the move at his firm's F8 developers conference in San Francisco. He said more than 600 million people already used Messenger at least once a month to express themselves, and that allowing other social networks and services to directly post to it would make "conversations better". Among the new apps unveiled are ways to post: It builds on a move to allow US-based users to send money to and from each other via Messenger, which Facebook announced last week, and the earlier inclusion of Voip (voice over internet protocol) calls and stickers. Mr Zuckerberg also revealed plans to launch an associated service called Businesses on Messenger. Using the app instead of email, the public will be able to hold conversations with companies from which they buy goods, or have other interactions with. Facebook suggested this could include receiving delivery status updates, organising the return of an order and asking follow-up questions. The company is far from the first to attempt to turn a messaging app into a wider platform. China's WeChat service has gone even further by allowing its users to book taxis, pick cinema seats and find nearby restaurants among other actions. But one expert suggested Facebook should be cautious about the rate at which it adds further facilities to Messenger. "There's a potential risk that they are going to overload Messenger with too many functions and none of them become that important - it really depends on how extensive they get with the features that they add over time," said Brian Blau from the Gartner tech consultancy. "We have seen something like that happen with Facebook's Timeline, where you have all these different people competing for your attention. "So, Facebook won't want to over-bloat, but it could enable all kinds of interesting scenarios where you can integrate messaging with other apps and services." Right now many of the Messenger apps look fun, if a bit gimmicky. But over time these new interactions will give Facebook another source of rich information about a user's interests - and thereby the potential to attract more ad revenue. Facebook would have taken inspiration from companies like China's WeChat and Japan's Line, which have proven successful in building both content and business services atop their core messenger offerings. But Messenger for Business is an ambitious plan. It is asking users to supplant more tried-and-tested means like email. Other communications behemoths like Skype tried - unsuccessfully - to become places to reinvent communications between businesses and their customers. Will users be happy to shift their business interactions over to Facebook - a platform where, until now, they have been used to dealing primarily with friends? Other announcements made at F8 included:	Facebook has confirmed that it is opening up its Messenger service to third-party developers, allowing them to add functions of their own.
An eyewitness said Charing Cross underground station "filled with smoke" at about 15:20 BST. One person has been arrested in relation to the incident, British Transport Police said. The station was closed for more than half an hour until the smoke cleared. Allie Elwell, who was in the station at the time, said there were "cops everywhere". She said: "It was madness. There were fans singing and cheering down the tunnel. "We turned the corner and could smell smoke. Fans seemed to just ignore it all, still singing and banging on the side of the escalator. "Soon after, there was announcement on the PA to evacuate due to an emergency. We jumped on one of the last Tubes." Crystal Palace play Manchester United in the FA Cup final at Wembley later. The area is now safe and the fire alarms have been reset, with the station reopening just before 16:00 TfL did not say which group of fans were responsible.	A Tube station was evacuated after football fans heading to Wembley Stadium set off a smoke bomb and fire alarms, Transport for London (TfL) has said.
Released by Norwich City as a schoolboy, he entered semi-professional football, turning out for King's Lynn and Staines Town, who play in the Ryman Premier Division. It was there, in the foothills of the English game, that he looked west and decided to move to the United States. Dwyer signed up to a firm who - for a fee - help organise soccer scholarships at US colleges for young, talented British footballers. Getting a scholarship means the college pays some, or all, of the student's tuition fees and costs. The firm, Soccer Icon USA, held a trial at QPR's training ground, to see whether those who had signed up were good enough for college soccer. "I think I scored a hat-trick in the first 10 minutes," remembers Dwyer, now 25. "The coaches took me off early and said: 'So - whereabouts in America do you want to go?'" Dwyer spent two years at Tyler Junior College in Texas, before moving to the University of South Florida. While there, he was signed by Major League Soccer club Sporting Kansas City. He has since scored more than 30 MLS goals, was named in the 2014 All Star team alongside Thierry Henry and, in 2015, is on a guaranteed salary of more than £300,000 a year. He is also married to Sydney Leroux, who was a member of the USA's World Cup-winning women's team earlier this year. "It's pretty amazing," says Dwyer. "I'm a little kid from England, and last year I was at the White House [after winning the 2013 MLS Cup]. "I just thought: 'What are they doing, letting me in here?'" Dwyer is not the only British player who has gone from US college to the MLS. Matt Watson - who studied at the University of Maryland, after being released by Wolves as a youngster - plays for Chicago Fire. Otis Earle, son of former Wimbledon midfielder Robbie Earle, is at FC Dallas, via the University of California, Riverside. Preston-born Luke Mulholland, who studied in North Carolina, is at Real Salt Lake, while Andy Rose, once a Bristol City youth, went from the University of California in Los Angeles to Seattle Sounders. Few Britons will emulate their careers. But more and more are trying. According to the Fulbright Commission, almost 11,000 British students were at American colleges in the past academic year - an increase of 21% in the past 10 years. Although the number of soccer scholarships is not recorded (there's no American equivalent of Ucas, the organisation through which applications are processed in England and Wales) it is clear they are becoming more popular. Chris Cousins, who runs Sports Recruiting USA, went to Illinois on a soccer scholarship in 2003. "I was probably one of a dozen going to America, if that," he says. Now, he estimates that more than 600 British students - male and female - will cross the Atlantic to start soccer scholarships this year. Cousins thinks rising tuition fees in England is one factor, having increased from £1,100 in 2003 to a maximum of £9,000 a year now. He also thinks social media has played a part. "When you see your mate on Twitter or Facebook playing in California or Florida, it makes it more tempting," said Cousins. College soccer is certainly attractive: in 2013, more than 30 teams had average attendances of more than 1,000, 10 with more than a 2,000 average, with some derbies attracting over 10,000 fans. To put that in perspective, last season English League Two sides Morecambe and Accrington both averaged less than 2,000. The biggest games are shown on national television, and there is a clear route to turning pro: every year, MLS clubs take their pick of the best college players via the superdraft. But there is another reason why more Britons are heading to American colleges - the rise in companies, or middlemen, who arrange soccer scholarships. Pass4Soccer, which began in 2003, was one of the first. According to their latest annual report, they now have 40 competitors. "It seems in the past 12 years they've sprung up left, right, and centre," said Daniel Gray, a director at the company. "Five years ago, there were 10 or 15. Now there are 40. People are jumping on the bandwagon." Each firm is different but, broadly, the model is the same. Students pay a fee, and the company gets them a place at a US college - if they are good enough on the pitch and are capable of getting a degree. The companies' fees vary. Sports Recruiting USA, one of the cheapest, charges £999; Pass4Soccer is £1,295; others charge more than £2,000. The firms claim it is money well spent - they say, with contacts and experience, they are able to get better scholarships for their students. Pass4Soccer, for example, estimate that 15% of their students get full scholarships - meaning the college pays all of the student's fees and living costs. Sports Recruiting USA say their students, on average, get 90% scholarships - leaving students to pay just 10%. When a year at a US college costs the average international student more than £20,000, paying £1,000 or £2,000 to a firm could be a wise investment. But, as one QPR player knows, not everyone needs a middleman. When Tyler Blackwood was 18, he had - in his own words - "given up". As a schoolboy, Tottenham Hotspur said he was too short. Watford said the same, as did Northampton Town. After a growth spurt, Blackwood, who is now over 6ft, was invited to a trial game at lower-league Barnet. But, on the day of the game, the manager Paul Fairclough resigned and his trial never happened. Instead, he began working in his dad's bar in Oakwood, north London. "It was a horrible year," remembers Blackwood. "I had friends in the pro game, and I was watching them make their debuts. "Football had always been my plan, then suddenly I realised - it's not going to happen." When his dad encouraged him to kickstart his career at an American college, they paid for a firm to arrange a scholarship. "But the offers were from bad schools in terrible states," says Blackwood. "In the end, I got my money back and did it myself." In 2011, the family went on holiday to Florida, so Blackwood emailed the soccer coach at the University of Tampa, asking for a trial. The college accepted him, but offered only a 25% scholarship. "My dad borrowed money, took out loans, to make sure he could pay the rest," says Blackwood, now 24. "I told him he'd only have to pay for the first year, and then I'd get a full scholarship. And I did." This summer, Blackwood returned to England for a trial at QPR. It was successful, and he made his debut in August, away to Yeovil in the League Cup. He is completing his four-year degree in London, taking his laptop on the team bus to catch up with work. "I recently had an exam that started at 8pm, Florida time," says Blackwood. "That was 1am in the UK. I'm looking forward to graduating, put it that way." As Blackwood shows, the quality of British players heading to America, as well as the quantity, is increasing. Cousins says that, 10 years ago, it was "county players getting the best scholarships - now it's people getting released from Chelsea and Manchester City". But what do British players offer that Americans - or other nationalities - do not? "Work ethic sets them apart," says Steve Clements, who coached Dom Dwyer at Tyler Junior College in Texas. "I must have had 100 British players, and they've always been hard-working. For example, nobody outworked Dom. "Fantastic player, fantastic person, and a good friend. At Christmas, I came into my office and there he was, on a surprise visit. "He didn't even tell me he was coming. He's that sort of guy." And, says Clements, the British bring something else to the team, as well as hard work. "The Brits have fantastic humour. They're sarcastic, you know? And they can play." For those who do not make it professionally, the college degree is a decent consolation. Graduates from soccer scholarships move into a range of careers: one of Clements's former British students works for Bank of America, another supplies souvenirs to major league sports ("If you need a number one finger, I know who to call," he says). Joe Prince-Wright went on a soccer scholarship to the University of Pittsburgh and came back with two degrees: one in communication, and one in English writing. Those qualifications helped him become a website editor for the American network, NBC, in London. "Academically, college was an eye-opener," he says. "You only focus on your main subject in the last two years, so I was doing algebra classes, astronomy classes, everything. "We'd have classes, train for three hours a day, then have more classes. On a Friday you might fly three hours to Tampa, and have a game there. "On a Saturday, you'd fly four hours to Chicago, train, play on the Sunday, fly back, then start another week of classes. "It was like being a full-time student and a professional soccer player." One man who values a college education is Dwyer, who turned professional before finishing his degree in communications and psychology. However, despite his fame and fortune, he plans to complete his course, graduate, and finish the adventure he started six years ago.	Six years ago, Dom Dwyer's career was going nowhere.
Crews were called to a building site in Bloomery Circle, Llanwern, at 21:15 BST on Wednesday. The blaze burned for more than 10 hours before it was extinguished. It is understood the burning material included a large amount of scrapped railway sleepers. A Gwent Police spokesman said: "Officers are investigating the circumstances surrounding the fire... which is believed to have been deliberately set."	A fire involving about 100 tonnes of waste wood and rubbish in Newport was started deliberately, the police and fire service have said.
Performers from the comic opera L'elisir d'amore gathered outside the Bow Street venue in full costume at 20:30 BST, alongside members of the audience. The theatre said the interruption was a false alarm and the show had restarted. People took to Twitter after being caught up in the real-life drama. Grace Mallon tweeted: "Exciting times at Elisir d'Amore @RoyalOperaHouse - first time I've been evacuated for a fire alarm in the middle of a performance!" Matt Innes‏ tweeted: "Delightful Donizetti interrupted for a fire alarm, but about to restart to a cheer. Blitz spirit right here." Michael Amon‏ added: "#royaloperahouse big says that wasn't a drill and thanks everyone for a "brilliant" evacuation. Ready to start in a couple minutes."	Cast members and theatre-goers were evacuated from the Royal Opera House in London after a fire alarm went off mid-performance.
