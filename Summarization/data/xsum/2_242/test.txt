The right-wing AfD party, formed only three years ago, came second in the chancellor's home state of Mecklenburg-West Pomerania, polling 21%. Mrs Merkel has defended her policies but said she needs to "win back trust". Some 1.1 million refugees and migrants entered Germany in 2015. Many of them arrived after the government decided to loosen border controls just over a year ago. Mrs Merkel, who is in China for the G20 summit, said she was "very unhappy" with the election result. "Everyone now needs to think about how we can win back trust - most of all, of course, myself," she said. "Obviously it [the election result] has something to do with the refugee question. But I nevertheless believe the decisions made were right and we have to continue to work on them." This is humiliating for Angela Merkel - not least because this was on home turf.  This election - which was seen as a significant test ahead of next year's general election - was all about her refugee policy. For a year she's insisted "Wir schaffen es" (we can do it) but German voters aren't convinced. Alternative fuer Deutschland's anti immigrant and increasingly strident anti-Islam message has a powerful appeal to people concerned about integration and worried about domestic security. It doesn't look good for Mrs Merkel. Her approval ratings are at a five-year low. But don't be tempted to write her off just yet - she has a habit of bouncing back and there is no serious contender waiting in the wings to replace her. The AfD leader in Mecklenburg-West Pomerania, Leif-Erik Holm, suggested that "perhaps this is the beginning of the end of Angela Merkel's chancellorship". AfD (Alternative fuer Deutschland) now has delegates in nine of Germany's 16 states. "It's a debacle for Angela Merkel and her refugee policy," said Edmund Stoiber, honorary chairman of the Bavarian-based CSU, the sister party of the CDU. It was not enough to criticise the AfD's voters, he argued - the CDU had to understand why people were losing faith in its policies. Mr Stoiber called for a limit on the number of people entering Germany. The CDU is in coalition nationally with the SPD, and also regionally in Mecklenburg-West Pomerania, although that may now change. Wolfgang Bosbach of the CDU said the arrival of hundreds of thousands of migrants without documents had "put the wind in AfD's sails". CSU Secretary General Andreas Scheuer spelt out that what was now needed was a cap on refugee numbers and better repatriation of failed asylum seekers. Ahead of the vote Mrs Merkel gave a defiant interview on immigration, insisting that change was not a bad thing and that "Germany will remain Germany, with everything that is dear to us". Although the chancellor's popularity has fallen nationally, she still has 45% approval ratings and has yet to decide if she wants to run for a fourth term in the September 2017 elections. "How many more electoral disasters can Merkel take?" wonders tabloid Bild, predicting that opposition to the chancellor inside her conservative bloc could erupt with full force. A piece in the Sueddeutsche Zeitung predicts an "autumn of discontent" for the chancellor, while Die Welt thinks many of her long-standing critics will now "break cover" and "let rip". Der Spiegel believes while the election is a "debacle" for Mrs Merkel, her job is not on the line quite yet.  And Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung argues that voters are angry at "(almost) all" mainstream parties, and not just the Christian Democrats, mainly over globalisation and "compromise-based politics". What does Germany's right-wing AfD want?

Indonesian jazz pianist Joey Alexander is the youngest performer ever to be nominated for the prestigious music award. He did not win a Grammy but while the young musician performed on stage, the cameras panned across to singer Bruno Mars, who was watching with glistening eyes. Many from Joey's homeland also expressed their admiration and support for the young star. You were definitely the star of the show," tweeted Indonesian music composer Sherina Sinna. Movie-maker Joko Anwar also described him as a "hope". Josiah Alexander Sila was born in Bali's Denpasar city to Christian parents Denny Sila and Farah Leonora Urbach, who ran a tourism business. His parents have described their son's talents as a "gift from God". There were no formal jazz classes in Bali where he grew up, so the young musician took part in jazz sessions with more experienced performers. It was then that his parents decided to make the move to the Indonesian capital Jakarta - home to one of the world's largest jazz festivals - to pursue Joey's musical dream. He went on to win music competitions before his family moved to New York in 2014. The child prodigy taught himself to play piano at age six, after his father bought him an electronic keyboard. Joey has said that learning music came naturally for him, thanks to listening to songs from his father's personal jazz collection. "My dad played a little bit of piano and guitar, but not that professionally," Joey said in an early interview, about falling in love with the piano. "I saw him play and I said, 'I want to play. I want to try this instrument.'" The young musician considers Harry Connick, Jr. and Herbie Hancock among his main musical influences, and also admires Clifford Brown and Miles Davis. There could be something in the blood because he is also the nephew of Indonesian rock singer Nafa Urbach. Renowned Jazz trumpeter Wynton Marsalis, discovered Joey after seeing him perform in a YouTube video in 2014. Praising the young pianist on Facebook, he then invited him to play at the Jazz at Lincoln Center's gala, making him him an "overnight sensation". Joey went on to make his US debut, performing at several Jazz festivals. Joey's debut album titled, "My Favourite Things" was released on 12 May, 2015. He was 11 years old at the time of its release. He  became the first Indonesian act to crack the US Billboard album charts, debuting at number 174. The record re-entered the charts and peaked at number 59 in January 2016.	He may be only 11, but he delivered a performance that brought the audience at the 2016 Grammy awards to their feet in a standing ovation.
The Scottish champions fielded a makeshift side in the 4-0 reverse and Rodgers was delighted with the 21-year-old he signed from Manchester City. "For Ollie it's about fitness - you see how he moves in the game today," the Celtic manager said. "He has the qualities to play at the very highest level." Ntcham, a French international youth player, spent the past two seasons on loan at Genoa in Italy. He played for just over an hour of Saturday's friendly and Rodgers reckons that was enough to show how vital he will be. "His range of passing, it makes the game look very simple," Rodgers added. "He can play short, play long, he can dribble and shoot. "He has everything to be a top, top level number eight. It's just timing really, that's his first game so 65 minutes was enough for him. He'll just build up his fitness over the next few weeks and when he's ready he'll be a big player for us." Another player to have recently signed a four-year deal with Celtic, Kundai Benyu, has also made a big impression on his new boss. He played more than 70 minutes on Saturday and Rodgers admitted the 19-year-old, signed from Ipswich, has forced his way into contention. "Young Kundai did really well," he said. "He's surprised me to be honest. I knew he was a good player, you can see what we're trying to build here in terms of players who are technically gifted, but they have to have good mobility and good physicality, and he has that. He's come in and played with a nice little edge, he's competitive and he's got confidence. "How he receives the ball is very good, he's an attacking player, he wants to get goals and he's actually quite exciting. "Initially the plan was to have him in, thinking he would maybe get an idea of how we work and then go on loan, but I've sort of changed my mind on him after watching him. I think it's going to be good for him to have at least six months with us, see how we train, see how we work, get an education on our footballing idea then review it again in January and see where he's at. "He's certainly a boy who can contribute for us and he's done very well." Second-half goals from Maxwel Cornet, Myziane Maolida Nabil Fekir and Amine Gouiri won the friendly for Lyon, who finished fourth in the French top flight last season. But Rodgers was happy with how the match went. "I really enjoyed it," he said. "Up until the first hour it was a real good game. I have a responsibility to try to get as many of my players as fit as we can for the beginning of the season and for throughout the season. "First half we were very good, some of our combination play, the speed in our game was excellent and we should have went in in front at that time. "Once we make the changes into the second half it becomes a little bit broken, and the level in our quality changes. For the senior players it was great to get game time."	Brendan Rodgers says Celtic new boy Olivier Ntcham proved he has the ability to play at the very top level in Saturday's friendly defeat to Lyon.
The world's biggest clothing retailer posted net earnings of €1.26bn (£1.1bn) in the six months to 31 July - up 8% on the same period last year. Sales jumped from €9.4bn to €10.5bn, an increase of 11%. The group's clothes can now be bought online in around 40 countries, it said. Inditex operates eight brands in 90 countries including Pull&Bear, Massimo Dutti and Bershka. How Zara's founder became the richest man in the world - for two days Chairman and chief executive Pablo Isla emphasised the firm's investment in technology, saying the firm had expanded its online stores to 11 new countries in the period. It also launched mobile phone payment in all its Spanish stores, with the objective of "extending the service to other countries". This will encompass online apps for all of its brands and a specific app for the whole group called InWallet. Mr Isla said: "Both our online and bricks-and-mortar stores are seamlessly connected, driven by platforms such as mobile payment, and other technological initiatives that we will continue to develop." Tom Gadsby, an analyst at Liberum, said the firm's "online drive" was important. "I expect over the years they may find they don't have to open as many stores to maintain their strong growth rate as the online channel will become increasingly important," he said. "And while Zara is available in many of the territories in which they operate [online], most of their other brands aren't readily available outside Europe online. "So there is a big opportunity there for them to expand online into new territories." The company also said it had benefited from steady economic growth in Spain, where Inditex gets about a fifth of its sales. That country's clothing market grew at an average of 3% in the three-months to the end of July, according to the Spanish statistics agency. All of the group's brands increased their international presence during the period, with 83 new stores opened in 38 countries. In a call with analysts, it said it would open 6-8% of new store space over course of the year. The firm's strong performance sets it apart from European rivals H&M and Next, which have blamed unseasonal weather for below-forecast results this year.	Profit jumped at Zara owner Inditex in the first half of the year as the firm opened new stores and invested in online.
The 26-year-old England tight-head prop, who was sent off, pleaded guilty at a disciplinary hearing on Tuesday. Brookes will miss Saints' Premiership game at Leicester on Saturday and their Champions Cup game with Leinster. Newcastle lock Calum Green, 26, has also been banned for a week after admitting striking with his arm. Green, who will miss Falcons' home game with Harlequins on Sunday, struck Brookes with his forearm during the same game and was cited by the citing commissioner after the incident was missed by referee Andrew Jackson. Brookes was dismissed in the 38th minute of Saints' 22-16 defeat when he charged into the ruck and struck the head of Newcastle hooker Scott Lawson with his shoulder.	Northampton's Kieran Brookes has been banned for two weeks after admitting charging into a ruck without using his arms in Friday's loss to Newcastle.
Joe Acquaro was shot dead in Melbourne in the early hours of Tuesday. Investigators believe underworld bosses may have put a price on his head. The lawyer was well-known in the city's Italian community and his body was found outside a cafe he owned. Clients included crime bosses accused of extortion, drugs and arms offences. A vicious gangland feud that claimed at least 28 lives in Melbourne ended more than a decade ago, but detectives say that underworld tensions still fester in Australia's second biggest city.	Police in Australia believe a lawyer who represented some of the country's most notorious organised crime figures was the victim of a contract killing.
Bohn, ranked world number 71, had chest pains following the second round and called for a medic. "He was taken by ambulance to Palm Beach Gardens Medical Center, where tests revealed a mild heart attack," a PGA Tour statement said. "Jason is resting comfortably and in good spirits," his agent added. "He is scheduled to have more tests this weekend," Justin Richmond said. "We know he appreciates the concern from so many people in the PGA Tour family who have reached out." The PGA Tour statement added Bohn's wife was at "home in Atlanta but his in-laws joined him at the hospital, as did fellow player George McNeill, who said Bohn was in good spirits". Bohn carded 72 in the second round, which would have seen him make the cut at the PGA National. Saturday's third round proceeded without Bohn, and finished with Spain's Sergio Garcia and Australia's Adam Scott sharing a commanding four-shot lead over America's Blayne Barber. Northern Ireland's Rory McIlroy missed the cut for a second year.	American two-time PGA Tour winner Jason Bohn has suffered a heart attack at the age of 42 during the Honda Classic in Florida.
The protest by the Gorkha Janamukti Morcha party is demanding a separate state for Nepali-speaking Gorkhas. A large number of paramilitary troops and police have been deployed to maintain peace in the hill region. Tourism and tea production will be worst hit by the strike, locals say. The strike began at 06:00 India time (00:30GMT) on Monday and reports say there is little traffic on the highway that connects Darjeeling with the town of Siliguri in the plains of north Bengal. About a dozen supporters of the Gorkha Janamukti Morcha (GJM) were held after they set a motorcycle and a car on fire in the Rambi area, the Press Trust of India news agency said. Supporters also blocked roads in the region. Darjeeling town was largely deserted with tourists staying away from the hills. Reports said 1,000 GJM supporters were protesting at Chowkbazar with party flags, while large gatherings were also reported from Jorbungalow, Mirik and Sukhiapokhri. Roads were also barricaded by the GJM in Kalimpong and Kurseong towns. The GJM has written to PM Manmohan Singh urging him to accept their demand for a separate state they want named Gorkhaland. "Our demand for Gorkhaland is an old one and generations of our people have fought for it. Now we want it because we see no future for us in West Bengal," said GJM general secretary Roshan Giri. Mr Giri said as the Congress-led government in Delhi was "considering" creating a new state of Telangana to be carved out of the southern state of Andhra Pradesh, "it was about time they concede Gorkhaland". "Our demand for a separate state is as old, as justified and meaningful as that of a separate Telangana," he added. In June 2011, the GJM signed a deal with the Indian government and the government of West Bengal state for greater autonomy. The deal paved the way for the setting up of a Gorkhaland Territorial Administration (GTA), an elected body for the Darjeeling hills. It is not clear whether the GJM will now relinquish its responsibility of running the GTA. West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerji has said she is upset with the revived agitation and warned that it will be "tackled in a tough way if it turned violent". The Gorkha campaign for a separate state started in the early 1980s. But a settlement that gave them considerable autonomy brought the movement to an end in 1988. However, five years ago, the movement was resumed by Gorkha hardliners who say the autonomy arrangement has not worked.	A 72-hour strike called by the main Gorkha ethnic group in India's West Bengal state has brought life to a standstill in the tea-producing Darjeeling hills.
Tara Hudson, 26, from Bath, was jailed at the all-male HMP Bristol for 12 weeks after admitting assault. Her supporters claim it has placed her in danger of sexual violence and more than 110,000 people have signed a petition calling for her to be moved. Her appeal will be heard on Friday. Hudson's mother said she was being sexually harassed by other prisoners. Jackie Brooklyn said her daughter was "constantly" having sexual taunts shouted at her in the jail. Hudson has had reconstructive surgery and lived as a woman all her adult life but is still legally a man. The Prison Service said it was a longstanding policy to place offenders according to their legally recognised gender. "There are strict rules in place to ensure transsexual prisoners are managed safely and in accordance with the law," a spokesperson said on Tuesday. The appeal against the custodial sentence is scheduled to be heard at Bristol Crown Court on Friday.	A transgender woman placed in a men's prison, sparking a wave of criticism, is to appeal against her sentence.
The 22-year-old spent last season on loan at Southend and Luton, scoring nine goals in a combined 43 matches in League One and League Two respectively. The striker also scored for the Shrimpers in the fourth-tier play-off final victory over Wycombe while on loan at Roots Hall in 2014-15. He only made two league starts for Charlton before being let go in May. Find all the latest football transfers on our dedicated page.	Cambridge United have signed forward Joe Pigott on a one-year deal following his release by Charlton Athletic.
The 29-year-old finished 11th in the -94kg class for Armenia, where he was born, but has since switched to represent the United States. A retest of his 2012 sample revealed the presence of a steroid. A total of 43 weightlifters have now failed retests from the 2008 and 2012 Olympic Games. Six more competitors from Vardanian's event at the London Olympics are already facing disqualification after retests found steroids. Vardanian was previously banned for six months in 2009 after testing positive for cannabis.	American weightlifter Norik Vardanian has tested positive for a banned substance in a sample he gave while competing for Armenia at London 2012.
Christopher Adjei, 29, of Riversdale Road, Ramsgate, pleaded guilty to assault with intent to commit a sexual offence and battery. Kent Police said he grabbed the woman, tried to cover her mouth with his hand, and forced her to the ground in the early hours in Church Lane. Adjei fled the scene when the woman asked what he wanted. Officers traced Adjei after his DNA was found on the victim's coat and were able to piece together his whereabouts on 14 June 2014, the night of the attack, based on his bank details and a train ticket to Canterbury. Det Sgt Daniel Aylett said Adjei put the victim through a terrifying experience. A warrant was issued for Adjei's arrest after he walked out of a Canterbury Crown Court hearing in August. He was arrested the following month in the Thanet area. Adjei was also ordered to spend two years on extended licence after his release from jail as part of his sentence.	A man has been jailed for four years for attacking a woman in her 20s in the street in Canterbury.
After EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation), the club recorded a loss of £142,659. "It is very pleasing to report continued improvement in our results," chief executive Jamie Clifford said. "The club has seen just short of £1m improvement in EBITDA since 2009 - an objective that was at the heart of our strategic planning." Kent have also reported a strengthened balance sheet, with a net asset value of £7.7m - an improvement of just under £1.4m over the year. The club also sold land at the Old Dover Road side of the St Lawrence Ground to property developers shortly after the end of the financial year, after being granted planning permission. "This marks a key moment in the club's history. We can expect the construction of high-quality retirement apartments to commence in the coming months," Clifford added.	Kent have announced an improved pre-tax profit of £345,784 for the financial year to November 2015.
British and Irish Lion North, 23, has signed a new contract with Northampton Saints in England's Premiership. The 23-year-old's previous deal was due to expire next summer and he had been linked with a return to Wales. "We'd all want to see our best players playing in Wales," Davies said. "Why would we want it any different?" Davies was Scarlets chief executive when North left them for Saints in 2013, and moved to the Pro Rugby Wales role in September 2014. He would like to see players such as North back in Wales to offer a "return on investment to the regions that have developed them" as well as to reward fans and to inspire younger players. Davies added: "From the national squad's point of view, the coaches are very clear that they fundamentally believe that it is a better environment in terms of player management for the players to be playing in Wales. "They can manage them better in conjunction with the regions." North, capped 55 times by Wales and also a 2013 Lions tourist in Australia, has appeared 42 times for Saints. There was speculation he might emulate Wales team-mate and former regional colleague Jonathan Davies, who will return to Scarlets from Clermont Auvergne on a Welsh Rugby Union dual contract next season. Former Wales centre Tom Shanklin is also disappointed North will remain in England. "It's probably good for him personally because he's at a very good club and in a very good league," Shanklin told Scrum V Radio. "But I want to see all the Welsh players back. That's going to strengthen our league and strengthen our product on the field. "We had some great news Jon Davies is coming back so it's a bit of a shame."	Wales wing George North's decision not to return to a Welsh region is a disappointment, says Rugby Wales chief executive Mark Davies.
The Poland international was injured following a late challenge on his left knee by defender Antony Kay in Tuesday's 2-1 away win at MK Dons. Following an initial scan, the 23-year-old forward is now facing surgery. "If he gets back in under a year, he'll have done well," Wolves head of medical Phil Hayward told BBC WM. "He's really looking at a full year and maybe more than that. "He has suffered damage to both the cruciate and lateral knee ligaments, as well as other structural damage. There is a small fracture on the inside of the knee, indicative of the amount of force involved in the challenge. "He will see a consultant this week and undergo surgery once the swelling has subsided at some point in the next two weeks. The timeframe will become more apparent following surgery. But he is expected to be out for a considerable time." MK Dons defender Kay was yellow carded for the challenge by match referee Mark Heywood. Zyro is the third Wolves player to suffer a serious knee injury this season. Striker Nouha Dicko has been sidelined since August, while winger Jordan Graham was then himself ruled out for up to nine months in January. Wolves have also lost winger Razak Boukari and defender Ethan Ebanks-Landell for the season, while centre-half Mike Williamson (thigh injury) has not figured since returning to the club from Newcastle United in January. Since Christmas, they have also spent long spells without Zyro, who missed two months with a calf injury, James Henry, Dave Edwards and Jed Wallace. Henry made his first start since February in midweek, while Wales international Edwards made a late appearance from the bench. Wolves head coach Kenny Jackett has cleared up confusion over midfielder Kevin McDonald's whereabouts. It was reported that the 27-year-old Scot had been told to "train with the kids" after being left out of Jackett's matchday squad of 18 at MK Dons. But McDonald actually voluntarily chose to keep fit with Wolves' Under-18 side. They were the only ones in training, because the Under-21 team also had a game on Tuesday. McDonald, Wolves' player of the year in 2013-14 when they won the League One title, has not made the starting line-up since 8 March and has been linked with an end-of-season move to Scottish Championship winners Rangers. Wolves boss Kenny Jackett and head of medical Phil Hayward were speaking to BBC WM's Rob Gurney.	Injury-hit Wolves have suffered a new blow with the loss of Michal Zyro for potentially more than a year with multiple knee ligament damage.
She replaces Jo Stevens, who resigned last month in protest at an instruction that Labour MPs should back the bill to trigger Brexit. Ms Rees is the fifth appointment to the role since the 2015 general election. Mr Corbyn said his team's strength would "develop Labour's alternative plan to rebuild and transform Britain". In other appointments, Rebecca Long-Bailey becomes shadow business secretary, Sue Hayman takes the environment, food and rural affairs brief, and the new shadow chief secretary to the Treasury is Peter Dowd. Ms Rees was a shadow justice minister in January 2016 but resigned after the EU referendum, only to return to the job in October 2016. She backed Andy Burnham for the Labour leadership in 2015 and Owen Smith in 2016. A former Welsh squash international who won more than 100 caps, the new shadow Welsh secretary was preceded by Ms Stevens, Paul Flynn, Nia Griffith and Mr Smith. Ms Rees was previously married to former Labour Welsh Secretary Ron Davies. Christina Rees is the fourth MP to hold the shadow Welsh secretary's job under Jeremy Corbyn - and the fifth since the general election less than two years ago when she entered parliament. She supported Owen Smith's challenge to Mr Corbyn's leadership last year but voted with the Labour leader to trigger Brexit this week. Eight Welsh Labour MPs rebelled in that vote, including Shadow Arts Minister Kevin Brennan. Unusually, the Cardiff West MP and other frontbench rebels are likely to keep their jobs, a sign of Mr Corbyn's limited authority as leader.	Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has named Neath MP Christina Rees as the new shadow Welsh secretary.
Mr Trump pointed to the fact that during the caucus the Cruz campaign told voters rival Ben Carson planned to quit the race, which was not true. The Cruz campaign apologised to Carson's camp, saying it was a misunderstanding. Mr Trump also cited Cruz leaflets that accused Iowans of "voting violations". Paul Pate, the top election official in Iowa, condemned the mailers on Saturday, saying the state does not track or grade individual voters. Mr Pate said Mr Cruz's mailers "misrepresent Iowa election law" and that they were "not in keeping in the spirit of the Iowa Caucuses," but he stopped short of any official action. "Ted Cruz didn't win Iowa, he stole it. That is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated. Bad!" Mr Trump said. Earlier, he wrote on Twitter that Mr Cruz "illegally" won the caucus, but later deleted the tweet. The reaction contrasts with his concession speech on Monday night, which was seen as a humble departure from his usual bombastic style. Mr Trump placed second in Monday's contest, which he called "a long-shot great finish" in an earlier tweet. Mr Cruz's camp is not taking the accusations too seriously. "Reality just hit the reality star - he lost Iowa and now nobody is talking about him, so he's popping off on Twitter," Mr Cruz's communications director Rick Tyler told Politico in an email. "There are support groups for Twitter addiction, perhaps he should find his local chapter." There is no precedent for re-doing a caucus. The remaining candidates are now in New Hampshire, the next state to hold a primary vote, where Mr Trump is leading in the polls. Rand Paul, a Republican who represents the Libertarian wing on the party, dropped out of the race on Wednesday after finishing fifth in Iowa.	Presidential candidate Donald Trump has called for a new election in Iowa, accusing the Republican winner, Ted Cruz, of fraud.
Media playback is not supported on this device The 28-year-old, who won Olympic bronze in 2012, cleared 2.33m to finish second behind Italian Gianmarco Tamberi. Team captain Asha Philip was fifth in the women's 60m but Dina Asher-Smith suffered a minor hamstring injury in her semi-final and missed the final. And Lynsey Sharp and Adelle Tracey both failed to reach the 800m final. Sharp, the European and Commonwealth silver medallist, finished second in her heat, but her time of two minutes, 02.75 seconds was not quick enough to progress as a fastest loser. "Even though it may not look like it was a success, to me it was because I've learned a lot," said the Scot. In May 2014, Grabarz questioned his future in the sport after a knee operation left him jumping, in his words, "like a 16-year-old girl" and that failing to clear 1.80m on his return to training was "the most depressing day of his life". However, a first-time clearance of 2.33m saw him beat Erik Kynard, the man who won silver at the London Olympics, on countback. "I'm ecstatic, I just can't quite believe it," he said after winning Britain's third medal of the Championships. "If someone said I'd get that result two years ago I wouldn't have believed it, I would have bitten their hand off." Media playback is not supported on this device American Barbara Pierre won the women's 60m title in 7.02secs - 0.02 ahead of Dutch favourite Dafne Schippers. Philip crossed the line in 7.14 seconds to miss out on a medal. "I'm gutted," she said. "I came here for a medal, I wanted a medal. I came fifth and I didn't run a personal best or a season's best." Asher-Smith's withdrawal from the final was a precautionary move, given the Rio Olympics are only five months away. American Ashton Eaton won his third successive heptathlon title to add to the pentathlon title won by his Canadian wife Brianne Theisen-Eaton the day before. It makes them the first married couple to win gold medals at the same world championships. "I was thinking it doesn't matter what happens to me," said Eaton, who was born and lives in Portland. "Brianne is the one that stole the show. I am really happy about that and proud of her," he added of his wife, who finally ended a frustrating run of second-place finishes at major championships. Eaton's winning total of 6,470 points in the seven-event competition was 188 clear of nearest rival Oleksiy Kasyanov of Ukraine. Meanwhile, in a meeting in Slovakia, Tom Bosworth broke the 20km walk British record, finishing in one hour 20 minutes and 41 seconds. The 26-year-old Briton took one minute 22 seconds off the previous best, set by Ian McCombie in 1988.	Robbie Grabarz won high jump silver on another otherwise disappointing day for British athletes at the World Indoor Championships in Portland.
He is accused of fraud by cheating while riding for the publicly funded US Postal Service team. The lawsuit was filed by Armstrong's former team-mate Floyd Landis before being joined by the government in 2013. Armstrong was stripped of his seven Tour de France titles and banned for life in August 2012. The 45-year-old won the seven titles between 1999 and 2005. The US Postal Service sponsored the team between 1996 and 2004. Armstrong admitted to using drugs in all seven of his Tour wins in January 2013 while Landis was stripped of his 2006 Tour de France title for failing a doping test. The government wants Armstrong to pay back money the US Postal Service paid his team for sponsorship, plus triple damages. Landis could collect up to 25% of any damages awarded.	Banned cyclist Lance Armstrong's fight against a $100m (£79m) lawsuit by the US government has been set for a trial starting in Washington on 6 November.
An ultra low emission zone in London for the most polluting cars will come into force in April 2019 and reports say other cities will follow suit. The government will also produce a new air quality plan by the end of April. But Theresa May has said she will "take into account" drivers encouraged to buy diesel cars by previous governments. Former Labour Chancellor Gordon Brown introduced a lower vehicle tax in 2001 to encourage people to buy diesel cars, as they were more economical and thought to be less harmful in terms of carbon dioxide emissions. But there has been increasing concern from experts that the vehicles emit dangerous levels of nitrogen dioxide, which is thought to have caused thousands of premature deaths in the UK. The government has to produce a new air quality plan after receiving a "final warning" from the European Commission about breaches of legal air quality levels in the UK. It also lost two court cases in 2015 and 2016 over pollution levels brought by environmental lawyers ClientEarth. To tackle the issue, a so-called "toxin tax" is expected to be rolled out across several cities, charging drivers of diesel cars up to Â£20 per day to come into urban areas. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan announced on Tuesday that such a scheme - creating an the ultra low emission zone in the capital - would come into force in two years' time, with a charge of Â£12.50 for petrol cars that do not meet Euro 4 standards and diesel vehicles that do not meet Euro 6 standards. But motoring organisations have said diesel car drivers are being "punished" for following a previous government's policy. Mrs May has now hinted there will be schemes to help drivers who were told that diesel vehicles were the right purchase. Speaking on her trip to Jordan and Saudi Arabia, she said: "Decisions will be taken when we produce that [air quality] plan. "But I'm very conscious of the fact that past governments have encouraged people to buy diesel cars and we need to take that into account when we look at what we do in the future. " She did not set out any specific plans, but there have been reports of a scrappage scheme that could pay people to get rid of their diesel vehicles.	Diesel car owners could get some help from the government if cities adopt new charges to tackle pollution, the prime minister has suggested.
Competitors aged 14 to 19 are hiking distances of up to 55 miles (89 km) visiting 10 nominated tors over two days. The 56th event started at 07:00 BST, with 2,400 teenagers - many from school and youth groups from across the South West - taking part. The first teams are expected to cross the finish line on Sunday morning. Source: BBC/Ten Tors The teenagers left Okehampton Camp, where Dartmoor National Park head ranger Rob Steemson said it was an "enormous challenge". The event is organised by the Army and assisted by the Royal Navy, the Royal Air Force and the Dartmoor Rescue Group. Each team has a GPS tracker, so safety teams can find out where each group of teenagers is. The tracker also has an emergency button if help is needed.	Thousands of teenagers are trekking across Dartmoor in the famous Ten Tors challenge.
The former Manchester United captain wants to build the futuristic four-bedroom property on greenbelt moorland between Bolton and Bury. The partially-underground house was labelled a "Teletubbies" home because of its petal-shaped design. The planning committee approved the development by 12 votes to nine. The application will now be referred to the Government Office for the North West for consideration. The 36-year-old plans to have the kitchen in the flower's stigma, with its petals being bedrooms, bathrooms, a garage, a children's play area and a swimming pool. The planning application was turned down when it went before the planning committee last June. Officers from Bolton Council recommended its approval because of "its exceptionally high quality of design" and "sensitive relationship with the surrounding landscape". But committee members ignored the report's advice and voted 14-6 to refuse the application. The application was re-submitted with the height of a wind turbine lowered. A council spokeswoman said: "The committee has approved the plans and the application will now be referred to the Government Office for the North West (GONW) for consideration. "Should GONW consider it justified the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government has the power to intervene, and call in the application for him to consider. "However, if the scheme is approved by GONW and the scheme is not called in for review, then the application will be referred back to the council. The Director of Development and Regeneration will then ratify the decision, under delegated powers."	Footballer Gary Neville's controversial plans for an eco-friendly "Teletubbies" house have been given the go ahead by Bolton Council.
Margaret Gleeson, 70, died two days after a hernia operation at Wigan's Royal Albert Edward Infirmary in October 2015. Concluding an inquest into her death, Simon Jones ruled out neglect and said she died due to a rare complication. But he said he wanted to highlight concerns raised during the hearing. Mr Jones said he would write to both the hospital and the Department of Health about the issue of patient safety at weekends. However, Wrightington, Wigan and Leigh NHS Trust said it did not believe weekend staffing levels were to blame. "The trust does not believe that Mrs Gleeson's death was the result of any difference between the resources available and services provided at the weekend and those provided on weekdays," a spokesman said. "The trust already complies with national guidelines in relation to weekend working and is actively involved in an ongoing pilot scheme investigating the possible benefits which might be derived from seven day working." The trust said its own investigation had revealed shortcomings in "some aspects" of Mrs Gleeson's care, for which it offered its "sincere apologies". The inquest, sitting at Bolton Coroner's Court, heard medics believed Mrs Gleeson's operation had been a success, but it was later discovered that internal tissue had been torn during the procedure. Her condition then deteriorated. When questioned about weekend staffing during the hearing, the trust's Dr Sadasivam Loganathan agreed it was "a major concern". He said: "You don't give the same attention as the patient deserves." Mrs Gleeson's son, Peter Gleeson, said: "I think if she'd had the operation on a Monday or any other time in the week it would have possibly been a different outcome." Her daughter Julie Barnes added: "The surgeon himself said if she'd have been reviewed and it had been picked up on the Saturday, it would have been a totally different outcome." Stephen Jones, of Leigh Day solicitors, said the family were "disappointed" the coroner did not find neglect had been a factor. "Whether the different weekend working practice within the trust had any affect in Mrs Gleeson's case we don't really know," he said. "But what we can say is that sufficient concern was expressed by the clinicians at Wigan to cause patient concern."	A coroner has vowed to raise concerns about weekend staffing levels at a hospital where a grandmother died after a routine operation.
Wurz, 41, retired as a racing driver this week and has been asked by owner Stephen Fitzpatrick to run the team. The Austrian said: "I was approached. I would have preferred it not be out in public but I can't deny it." Wurz would not say whether he would accept the role, which would be senior to the new one created for Ryan. Manor team boss John Booth and sporting director Graeme Lowdon have resigned and their last race with the team will be the season finale in Abu Dhabi later this month. Neither has said why they have chosen to quit but it seems they have lost confidence in the management of Fitzpatrick. Ryan spent 34 years at McLaren before being forced to resign following the 'lie-gate' scandal in 2009, when he and Lewis Hamilton were found to have misled race stewards at the Australian Grand Prix. It is widely believed in F1 that Ryan was not responsible for the incident, but was forced to take public responsibility. He received a substantial redundancy payment from McLaren and has recently been running a team of McLaren cars in sportscar racing. Ryan, 61, said: "I'm very excited to be joining the Manor Marussia F1 Team at a pivotal time in their development. Media playback is not supported on this device "Having spent time with Stephen, and understood his vision for the future, it is clear he has ensured there is a strong platform from which the team can make big steps forward in the seasons ahead. "Manor has all the hallmarks of a fiercely competitive racing team, but having grown up in a much more contemporary Formula 1 era, it is a very lean operation with a collaborative culture, which leaves it well placed to contend with the sport's future direction. "There is clearly a big challenge ahead and a lot of work to do, but I can't wait to meet the wider team and get down to business." Full qualifying results Brazilian GP coverage details	Manor want former grand prix driver Alexander Wurz to be their team principal and have named ex-McLaren man Dave Ryan as racing director.
In the first World Series game at Wrigley Field since 1945, Coco Crisp was the Indians' match-winner. The 36-year-old outfielder came off the bench for a pinch-hit single that scored Michael Martinez from third base in the seventh inning. The fourth game in the best-of-seven series takes place in Chicago on Saturday. The Indians are seeking their first World Series title since 1948, while the Cubs are trying to win their first crown since 1908 to end America's record longest sports title drought. "It feels good," said Crisp, whose sister nicknamed him "Coco" after a cereal box character. "You want to do something that can help the team. Fortunately enough for me it was the hit."	The Cleveland Indians edged 2-1 ahead in the World Series with a 1-0 victory at Chicago.
James, 29, who presents the drive-time show, studied drama and had a number of shows on the students' union radio station before rising to fame. The DJ, who is covering Radio 1's Big Weekend in Norwich this bank holiday, said he was "completely honoured". Father Ted co-writer Graham Linehan and broadcaster Dame Jenni Murray are also receiving degrees. James said: "My affair with UEA continues - it really is wonderful and I'm completely honoured to be given this. "I spent a very happy three years there and it's the place where I fell in love with drama and radio, so it's very special to me. "As soon as the ceremony is over, I'll set about officially changing my name on all credit cards, mortgage documents and, most importantly, the Radio 1 website." James and Linehan will receive an Honorary Doctorate of Letters at a ceremony in Norwich in July, with BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour presenter Murray being given an Honorary Doctorate of Civil Law. Other names being recognised for their distinguished careers include comedian Arthur Smith, author Erica Wagner, actor Samuel West and the Bishop of Norwich, the Rt Rev Graham James.	BBC Radio 1 DJ Greg James is to receive an honorary doctorate from the University of East Anglia (UEA).
Warner, 26, was also fined £7,000 (AU $11,500) after the incident, which took place in Birmingham on Sunday morning. "A kid from the back blocks with a strong personality, Warner is outgoing, likes talking to people and always has an opinion. He is popular with his team-mates and respected in the dressing room. He has that lively and nocturnal side to his personality. But he is 26 now, and off the field he needs to change." He will now miss the remainder of his country's Champions Trophy campaign. Warner will also be absent for tour matches against Somerset and Worcestershire, but can play in the first Ashes Test on 10 July. England and Australia players were in the Walkabout pub in the early hours of Sunday when opening batsman Warner is alleged to have struck England batsman Root. BBC Radio 5 live's Pat Murphy said: "I believe it happened around 02:00 (BST) at the bar in the centre of Birmingham. "There was a private VIP area and some of the Australia players were in there. The three England players, Joe Root, Stuart Broad and Chris Woakes, were some way away and were larking around - wearing silly wigs and that. "I understand Warner took umbrage and went over to Root and glanced him on the chin. "Broad put his arm around Root as soon as it happened and said 'time to go back to the hotel' and I am also told that they were not worse for wear." Warner, who has played in 19 Test matches for his country, was dropped for Australia's Champions Trophy game against New Zealand on Wednesday as a punishment. He could have been sent home from the tour after pleading guilty to a charge of "unbecoming behaviour". Media playback is not supported on this device His suspension means he will not be allowed to play until the five-Test Ashes series begins at Trent Bridge. But Warner is in a poor run of form, with seven single-figure scores in his last nine innings while playing for Delhi Daredevils in the Indian Premier League and one-day internationals for Australia. Cricket Australia's behaviour commissioner, The Hon Justice Gordon Lewis, heard the disciplinary case in Melbourne via a teleconference. In a statement, the England and Wales Cricket Board cleared their players of any blame. "Following a full investigation, the England team management has concluded that the England player was in no way responsible for, nor retaliated to, the attack," said the ECB statement. England bowler Broad told Sky Sports: "We were within our rights to be out, and we did nothing wrong. We are obviously on show as England cricketers and we need to be aware of that." This incident is not the first time Warner has been in trouble with Cricket Australia and last month he was fined £3,700 for a foul-mouthed Twitter exchange with two Australian journalists.	Australia batsman David Warner has been suspended until the first Ashes Test match for an alleged attack on England batsman Joe Root in a bar.
The Royal Cornwall Hospital Trust said it was overwhelmed over Easter and is struggling to discharge patients. A ward closed at Truro's hospital on Monday because of an outbreak of Norovirus. People are being urged to avoid A&E unless absolutely necessary. In February, the trust declared a "black alert" for about a week. A black alert is the highest level of alert and means hospital services are unable to cope with demand. Dr Andy Virr from the trust said there were some issues with the NHS 111 phone system during the weekend which prevented calls getting through to the Cornwall GP service, which caused delays. That "led to people voting with their feet and coming to A&E" which meant some patients remained on trolleys for 10 or 11 hours and operations were cancelled, he said. Debbie Pritchard, from patient group Healthwatch Cornwall, was not surprised the alert was declared. "There is still a lot of confusion around what services people should access out of hours," she said. The county's Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG), NHS Kernow, is now asking people to consider the most appropriate place to go for treatment when unwell. Peter Stokes, deputy director of operations at the CCG, requested "relatives and friends be available to pick up people who have been inpatients and are ready to be discharged to free up beds".	A hospital trust in Cornwall has declared a "black alert" for the second time this year due to "extreme" pressure on its services.
Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 21, is charged with 30 counts related to the bombings, which killed three people and wounded more than 260 in April 2013. As part of the prosecution's summing up, medical examiners gave graphic details of the injuries suffered by those who died in the attack. Mr Tsarnaev could face the death penalty if found guilty. Massachusetts Chief Medical Examiner Henry Nields testified that the youngest victim of the attacks, eight-year-old Martin Richard, received injuries to every part of his body. The testimony was illustrated by autopsy photos and the child's bloody, torn clothing. Mr Nields said one piece of shrapnel appeared to have gone straight through Richard's body. "It would be difficult to say the precise location due to the size of the openings in the abdomen," he testified, according to Reuters. The defence began calling its own witnesses later on Monday. Earlier in the trial, the defence made the surprise admission that Mr Tsarnaev had participated in the attacks. But defence lawyers argue that his 26-year-old brother, Tamerlan, had been the driving force behind the attacks. By doing so they hope to spare their client the death penalty. Mr Tsarnaev is charged with 30 counts related to the bombings. The brothers set off a pair of homemade pressure-cooker bombs at the race's crowded finish line. Mr Tsarnaev is also accused of fatally shooting a police officer three days later. The prosecution says Mr Tsarnaev, who emigrated with his family from Chechnya, had extremist views and wanted to hit back at the US in revenge for military action in Muslim countries.	The prosecution has rested its case in the trial of a man accused of carrying out the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings.
The 34-year-old has been absent from the club since a training-ground row after the 5-1 Scottish Premiership loss at Celtic on 10 September. Alongside agent Eddy Jennings, he attended a meeting with club officials last week. Barton, who joined from Burnley in May, has repeatedly said he wants to return and fight for his Rangers place. "Joey Barton has been told he will return to full-time training following the conclusion of a disciplinary procedure," read a statement on Rangers' website. "The Auchenhowie [training base] management team will inform the player of appropriate training arrangements to which he must adhere for as long as he remains a Rangers player. "Neither the club, nor the player, will comment further." Barton is also facing Scottish FA charges for breaching betting rules. He was charged with placing 44 bets on games between 1 July and 15 September. The former Manchester City, Newcastle United and QPR player, who has one England cap, left Burnley under freedom of contract at the end of last season, signing a two-year contract at Ibrox. He has made eight appearances for Mark Warburton's side, who are second in the Premiership. Barton was not available for comment but said earlier on Wednesday on Twitter that it was "a lovely day for a @Iceman_Hof session and a run!" in reference to Dutch ice bath training guru Wim Hof. BBC Scotland's Richard Wilson The fact that Joey Barton is returning to full-time training does not necessarily mean the resumption of his Rangers career. Under Fifa rules, a player under contract at a club must be provided with training facilities. The fact that the player was suspended reflects the view of the management team about the serious nature of a training-ground row in September. Any return to the first-team squad would need to be handled in such a way as to not disrupt the mood and unity among the players. Rangers' statement does not say that Barton is returning to the first-team squad, or will be available for selection, and only the management team at their Auchinhowie training base is mentioned, rather than first-team manager Mark Warburton. Either the player does eventually return to the first-team squad, or his Rangers career effectively remains over and what happens in the January transfer window will be significant.	Rangers say midfielder Joey Barton "will return to full-time training" following a club-imposed suspension.
Webb had been linked with the role in 2015, with Blatter suggesting at a conference in the Caribbean on Monday that he could be replaced by Webb "in the near future". But Cayman Islands native Webb said: "No, definitely not. That is not my intention or my objectives at this time." Blatter, who has led Fifa since 1998, was speaking off the cuff before a speech to mark the opening of a Concacaf sport summit. The Swiss was introduced incorrectly to an audience of regional political leaders and confederation delegates as "Fifa's vice-president" by a local media officer. Total number of presidents: 8 Current president: Sepp Blatter, since 1998 Previous president: Joao Havelange from 1974 to 1998 Longest time spent in office: Jules Rimet - 33 years from 1921 to 1954 Number of English presidents: 3 - Daniel Burley Woolfall (1906-1918), Arthur Drewry (1955-1961), Stanley Rous (1961-1974) Blatter, 77, stepped up to the lectern and replied to the mistake by telling the media officer and assembled guests: "I think you're a prophet." He then added that there may be a new Fifa president in "the near future" and the next president "could be Jeffrey Webb". After receiving applause, he added: "This would not mean I would be vice-president. Once you have been a horse you don't go back to the stable." Sources close to Fifa have told BBC Sport that the comments should not be taken as a decision by Blatter that he will not stand as a candidate in the next election, scheduled for May 2015, and that all options are still open to him. Blatter told Uefa delegates in 2011 that this would be his final term of office but has this year given strong indications that he may seek a fresh mandate. The comments are the clearest indication so far that Uefa president Michel Platini - considered by many observers to be his most likely successor - is not the man Blatter wishes to see in power after he has left the role. Platini has yet to decide if he will stand in the 2015 election saying recently that he wanted more time to consider the matter. Webb, 49, was elected president of Concacaf in May 2012 following the acrimonious departures of former president Jack Warner and general secretary Chuck Blazer. Now one of seven Fifa vice-presidents, Webb started his time in football governance as president of the Cayman Islands Football Association in 1991.	Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football leader Jeffrey Webb says he has "no intention" of replacing Sepp Blatter as Fifa president.
Kiel Hauley, 33, Jonas Marcius, 23, and Adrian Morley, 33, deny assaulting and murdering Craig Grant, of Inverurie, outside the Galleria shopping centre in August last year. Witness Shaun Wheeldon said he saw Mr Grant being held on the pavement. He said he was "shocked" to see Mr Grant's face was light grey. Mr Wheeldon told the High Court in Aberdeen he could see two men restraining Mr Grant on the ground outside Tonik and stopped to speak to a bouncer. He said:  "He just said he had been in the club and he was highly drunk." Mr Wheeldon said there was "quite a commotion" outside the bar with a lot of people standing outside. Advocate depute James Keegan QC asked: "How did you react when you saw his face?" He replied: "I was shocked at the colour of him. He was light grey." Mr Keegan asked: "When you saw the colour of him what did you think?" He replied: "That he was in a bad way." He said Mr Grant's friends were trying to intervene when police arrived at the scene because he had shown no response on the ground. He told the court police took over and tried to sit him up. He said: "They sat him up like a teddy bear. It wasn't a recovery position." Mr Keegan asked: "When you say a teddy bear what do you mean by that?" He replied: "Because he was limp." The trial continues.	A man was limp "like a teddy bear" after he was restrained by bouncers on the ground outside an Aberdeen bar, a murder trial has heard.

Parts of Cardiff University's main building will remain closed on Wednesday after a fire.
Tom Stilwell fell from his neighbour's balcony in his apartment block in Auckland at 02:00 local time on Sunday (14:00 GMT on Saturday), reports said. He was trying to lower himself onto his balcony, which was directly below his neighbour's, when he fell, police said. His friends said that he had bone fractures and internal injuries, but was "fine" and "a very lucky man". He was awake and laughing on Monday, but had no recollection of what happened, his friends told New Zealand newsgroup Fairfax Media. "He looks alright," his flatmate, Beth Goodwin, said. "It's more internal injuries. He's broken some bones in his ribs and neck but they're not important bones." "The odds may be against it, but others have lived after even more dramatic plummets. "Juliane Koepcke, 17, was flying over the Peruvian rainforest with her mother when her plane was hit by lightning. But she survived a two-mile (3.2km) fall. "In January 1972, 22-year-old Yugoslav flight attendant Vesna Vulovic's plane exploded following a suspected terrorist bomb. The Guinness Book of Records recorded that Ms Vulovic plummeted 33,000ft (10,160m) before landing in snow." Read more In a statement, New Zealand police said: "It appears that the man was locked out of his 14th floor apartment. He fell while attempting to climb down the outside of the building from a 15th floor apartment directly above his, in an effort to gain access via his balcony." There were "no suspicious circumstances surrounding the fall", the statement added. The 20-year-old is said to be in New Zealand on a working holiday. Mr Stilwell discovered he was locked out of his flat early on Sunday, and asked a neighbour if he could climb down from her balcony into his flat, his friends said. The neighbour, Geraldine Bautista, told the New Zealand Herald that Mr Stilwell was "a little tipsy" but polite. "I wasn't scared of him - he just requested 'Can you please let me jump off from the balcony? I will not bother you, just let me use your balcony.'" "I never thought he would really do that. In my mind I thought 'Okay, I'll just let you see that it's really impossible. I didn't think he'd jump, because it's really scary." However, he quickly pulled himself over the balcony railing before she could stop him, she said. "I thought I was dreaming... it happened within seconds," she said. "I couldn't even scream for help." Mr Stilwell's fall was broken by the roof of an adjacent building, reportedly some 13 floors below. He was taken to hospital in a critical condition, but was in a satisfactory condition by Monday, a hospital spokesperson said. Dr Tony Smith, a medical director at St John, an emergency healthcare organisation, told the New Zealand Herald that a person's chances of survival were increased if they were able to break their fall on something. However, "survival from falls of that height are extraordinarily unusual", he said. In December 2007, New York window cleaner Alcides Moreno plummeted 47 floors when cables holding the platform he and his brother were working on failed. His brother died but Mr Moreno made a full recovery, something doctors attributed in part to his escaping major head injuries. In June 2010 a four-year-old boy escaped with minor injuries after falling from the 17th floor of a hotel in Miami. Joey Williams, who bounced off palm trees as he fell to the 10th-floor pool area, was sitting up in bed by the next day.	A British man has survived a fall from the 15th floor of a building in New Zealand, local media report.
However, observers inside the court said the prosecution evidence was difficult to follow or to understand. Correspondents said the most prominent video clip was by another al-Jazeera journalist who is not on trial. The three, including ex-BBC reporter Peter Greste, deny spreading false news and helping the Muslim Brotherhood. They appeared in the Cairo court on Tuesday along with other Egyptian students and activists being tried with them. Defence lawyers complained they were unable to understand some of the recordings being played because of poor technical quality. While the recordings were played, defendants talked among themselves in the caged dock. The trial was later adjourned until 3 May and bail for the defendants was denied, reports from the court said. Peter Greste, producer Baher Mohamed and al-Jazeera English's Canadian-Egyptian bureau chief Mohamed Fadel Fahmy have been held since December. A fourth al-Jazeera reporter, Abdullah Elshamy, who works for the network's Arabic channel, has been detained since August but not charged. Egyptian authorities accuse the journalists of aiding the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood, which has been banned as a terrorist group.	A court in Egypt has been shown video and audio evidence in the trial of three al-Jazeera journalists accused of terrorism-related offences.

His firm, Hong Kong-based Hutchison Whampoa, already owns the Three mobile network, and combining it with O2 would create the UK's biggest mobile group. However, the move could face tough scrutiny from competition regulators. It would reduce the number of major operators in the UK from four to three, which might not benefit consumers. Further consolidation within the telecommunications industry is already on the cards, with BT Group in talks to buy rival operator EE. If a deal is agreed it would have to be approved by competition regulators in Brussels. Currently the UK mobile market is dominated by O2, EE, Vodafone and Three. However, Hutchison Whampoa group finance director, Frank Sixt, pointed to deals in other countries, including Ireland, which were given the green light and which also reduced the number of competitors in the market from four to three. "The European Commission has taken a positive view of four-to-three consolidations of mobile in three cases now...and we believe that the precedents that they have set in those transactions will apply for this transaction," he said. Mark Newman, chief research officer at telecoms consultancy, Ovum, thinks there may still be grounds for concern. "The big question we should be asking ourselves is whether the consolidation will result in prices going up," he said. "It's worth looking at the Austrian market which has gone from five operators a few years ago to three today. It appears as though prices have gone up in the Austrian market." O2 said in a statement: "Three is known for campaigning on behalf of its customers, much like O2. "We are confident that an agreement will mutually benefit the customers of both companies, as well as drive better value, quality and investment in one of the most digitally competitive countries in the world." These are turbulent times for the UK mobile phone industry - and for its customers. Just a few years back, there were five operators - Orange, T-Mobile, Vodafone, O2 and the scrappy outsider, Three.  Now Three owner Li-Ka Shing's move for O2  means it is likely there will be three giants in charge of our phones and the prices we pay to use them. BT's move on EE, the merger of Orange and T-Mobile, appeared to raise few competition concerns because it won't cut the number of choices for consumers. Hutchison's plans are a different matter. Three has been a small player making a big impact by bold pricing moves such as offering free international roaming and unlimited data deals.  But combined with O2 it would be the biggest operator, and might be keen to raise prices. The competition authorities in Brussels and in London seem certain to want to have a look at the deal, though some might argue that consolidation in Europe's most competitive mobile market is inevitable and will lead to more investment in better networks. One company which might be cheering the regulators on is Vodafone. It was already unhappy about the implications of any  BT/EE deal - now what was the UK's global telecoms powerhouse faces being an also-ran in its home market. Hutchison said in a statement that the exclusive negotiations with Telefonica will take a period of several weeks. "Shareholders and potential investors of the company should note that such negotiations may or may not result in any transaction, and accordingly are advised to exercise caution when dealing in the shares of the company," it said in a filing to the Hong Kong stock exchange. Hutchison shares jumped 4% on the announcement after they resumed trading in Hong Kong. They had been suspended on Friday morning pending the statement. Mr Li has spent more than £20bn on overseas acquisitions in recent years. Earlier this week, he agreed to buy the UK's Eversholt Rail Group for £1.1bn. The 86-year old is also undertaking a major reorganisation of his business empire, which has interests in property, energy, ports and telecoms. The conglomerates Cheung Kong Holdings and Hutchison Whampoa are both controlled by Mr Li.

Cesare Prandelli resigned as Azzurri coach after they were knocked out in the World Cup group stage. Former Italy midfielder Conte, 45, quit as Juventus boss last month, having won the Serie A title in each of his three seasons in charge. He has also managed Bari and Siena to promotion from Serie B, as well as having spells at Arezzo and Atalanta. The Italian Football Federation said in addition to his salary, Conte would receive a bonus for qualifying for Euro 2016, an added bonus for climbing at least five places in the Fifa rankings - Italy are currently 14th - and a third bonus if they reach the final of Euro 2016. Conte is the second big appointment by the Italian Football Federation this week. Carlo Tavecchio, who made a racist comment during his election campaign, was named as its new president.	Italy have appointed former Juventus boss Antonio Conte as their new coach until 2016.
For the past 31 years, the European Union has had quotas, or limits, on how much milk farmers can produce. The rules were put in place so farmers wouldn't make too much but would also get a fair price. But now those quotas have been lifted so with no limits farmers are being allowed to produce as much milk as they want. Four farmers got in touch with Newsbeat to tell us how they'll be affected by the changes. "We've all known this has been coming for some time. We've been trying to put our businesses in the best possible position - to produce milk as cheaply as possible. "This means keeping as many cows and pushing out as much milk as we can for every worker, as well as producing as much milk as possible from grass - the cheapest feed available on our farm. "It's likely that this will lead to a flood of milk and probably pull down the price even further. "It's not an easy game and it never will be. I suppose, really and truly, the most efficient farms will survive the test of milk quota removal. "It'll be a survival of the fittest." "I'm from a family farm and we've mixed feelings about the end of the quotas as it leaves the dairy industry in an unknown area. "You don't know how the markets are going to evolve with the access to more products from Europe and also allowing farmers within the UK to expand. "Usually in the spring time, that's when the cows get [put] to grass, and you get an increase in milk production. "So if you're lifting the quotas at the same time, you're going to have a lot of milk in the country and not necessarily be getting a very good price for it." "I think pretty much everyone is aware that milk prices aren't great, which means farmers are losing money. "It's heartbreaking when you see people leaving the industry. It sounds silly, but cows become a part of your family and to face the prospect of walking into an empty farmyard is something none of us want. "The removing of quotas is potentially a great opportunity for famers to move into the global market. It's all down to how you see it, do you view it an opportunity? Or do you see it as a time to quit? Some people see it that way, but I hope that doesn't put young farmers off." "The milk price at the minute is devastating small farmers like myself, simply because you physically can't afford to carry on really. "It's going to get to the point where there's only going to be these so-called super farms left, with 1,000-2,000 cows or in some cases even more. "My parents are just barely scraping by to keep the household going. "Dairy farming's hard - you're doing 12-13 hours days every day. It's not a job, it's a way of life and we love it. "It's a valuable part of the English countryside and it just seems to be fading away. "It just seems sad that it might come to the point where we might have to give it up."

But many people will be asking this weekend if the 28-year-old is really worth all that money? To answer that you need to separate his value to United right now from how some might view his broader value in the transfer market. For all the income they generate, United are a club going through a difficult transition. They are way off the pace in the Premier League and struggling to qualify for the Champions League next season. The financial impact of failure this season will not dent the money making machine that is Old Trafford, but long term decline? That's a very different proposition. All of this has placed huge pressure on the club's new manager David Moyes and executive vice chairman Ed Woodward to show the club is still a force to be reckoned with despite the retirement of the formidable Sir Alex Ferguson. The record signing of Juan Mata from Chelsea in the January transfer window was the first part of what Woodward and Moyes hope will be a three-step strategy back to the top. Rooney's new deal is part two while the summer is phase three. That's when we will really be able to judge how serious the club's American owners, the Glazer family, are about rebuilding United's under-powered squad. Mata's arrival and Rooney's decision to stay - having been courted first by Manchester City and more recently Chelsea - will surely help the club attract top talent before the start of next season. The other thing to consider is that Rooney had just 18 months remaining on his previous deal. United knew they faced the possibility of him leaving for nothing. By signing him up for five and-a-half years, they have protected the value of arguably their most valuable and recognisable playing asset. So while the £85m agreement up to 2019 looks exorbitant, it's probably cheaper than United having to find a replacement in the transfer market and pay his wages. The total cost would have probably been much higher. It leaves United free to spend their money elsewhere - with midfield and defence arguably a greater priority. The deal Rooney has signed is, I am told, worth around £250,000 a week in basic salary. What makes the new contract potentially much more lucrative to the England striker is an agreement with the club to market and exploit his individual commercial rights around the world. This obviously has benefits for both the club and the player but there is no doubting United's hugely successful commercial operation could help take Rooney to a new financial level and certainly on a par with Barcelona's Lionel Messi and Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo. In playing terms it would be hard to argue Rooney is in the same league as those two. But as things stand he is United's most marketable brand and that is ultimately why the club couldn't afford to let him go.	With projected revenues of £420m this year, there is no question Manchester United can afford to make Wayne Rooney the best paid player in the Premier League.
Bristol Crown Court heard Christopher Daldorph, 45, spent up to two hours a day over 14 years viewing the material. Officers from the National Crime Agency (NCA) found 20 devices at his home in West Wick, Weston-super-Mare, when he was arrested in April. One hard drive alone contained more than 150,000 images and videos. Daldorph admitted nine counts of making indecent photographs and one count of possessing extreme pornographic images between November 2010 and April this year. Passing sentence, Judge Geoffrey Mercer QC, said: "For over 14 years, as you admit, you have regularly set time aside to scour the darkest corners of the internet to find some of the more disturbing representations of child abuse available. "This is in my judgment an extreme case of downloading indecent photographs of children, because of the volume of the material which you downloaded over a substantial time." Christian Hall of the NCA said: "Daldorph was responsible for amassing hundreds of thousands of indecent images, some of them the most extreme possible involving very young children. "Each of those involved a child being abused in some of the worst ways imaginable." Daldorph, who had worked for the NHS for 17 years, was dismissed from his job after he was arrested.	A hospital radiographer, who downloaded more than a million indecent images and videos of children, has been jailed for two years and four months.

Last month, the board of crofting's regulatory body apologised for its handling of the dispute with crofters. It also asked convener Colin Kennedy to resign. But Mr Kennedy told BBC Scotland's Sunday Politics Scotland he was staying in the post. The dispute relates to the running of common grazings, including at Mangersta and Upper Coll on Lewis. Mr Kennedy said: "I have no intention of resigning. "As matters stand, I believe the commission have acted wholly within the law at all times and until such times as we have legal advice to the contrary, I will maintain my position." Last week, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said Scottish government ministers had the power to intervene in the affairs of the troubled commission. She said ministers would not ordinarily get involved in the internal operations of the commission. However, during First Minister's Questions in Holyrood on Thursday, she said legislation did give them the power to intervene if required.	The convener of Scotland's Crofting Commission has reiterated he will not stand down amid a heated public dispute over common grazings - unless he is forced to by the Scottish government.
The public car park is just off the Upper Newtownards Road, one of the main routes into the city. Thousands of wooden pallets are now piled up where previously there were parked cars. The bonfire makers are involved in a dispute with the city council over the storing of pallets. They say the council collected pallets from the area earlier this year, agreed to store them and return them this month but failed to do so. Bonfire builder Macauley McKinney, 21, said: "We had an agreement with the council that they were going to store the pallets in a safe place, and now because the agreement was broken, they've let us down." Belfast City Council is not commenting in detail on the issue, as an investigation has been called into the storing of pallets. A spokesperson said: "It was agreed at a meeting of Belfast City Council's Strategic Policy and Resources Committee on Friday that an investigation and full review, led by the chief executive with independent input, would be carried out into the issue of collection and storage of bonfire material, and the future approach of bonfires across the city." The committee's decision needs to be approved at a full council meeting next week. Traditionally, bonfires are lit in many loyalist areas of Northern Ireland on the "eleventh night" - the eve of the Twelfth of July, an annual celebration to mark William of Orange's victory over King James II at the Battle of the Boyne in 1690.	A car park in east Belfast has been closed to the public by young men building bonfires.
The next public consultation in the Greater Manchester Spatial Framework (GMSF) scheme was due in September but may not be published until summer 2018. Regional mayor Andy Burnham promised to revise the plans following protests from affected communities. The revised plans will be announced "in due course", the mayor's office said. The GMSF scheme identifies sites for housing developments that may be built over the next 20 years. The area's combined authority, which brings together 10 councils, published a joint plan last October to allocate land for development. Due to the scale of development required to meet expected population growth, it outlined plans to make swathes of protected greenbelt land available for new homes. The authority received more than 25,000 responses to the consultation while community groups protested against the plans. Mr Burnham, who was elected as metropolitan mayor in May, promised to "radically re-write" the plans, calling them "unfair and disproportionate". The BBC understands council leaders are not expecting the next consultation to take place until next year due to the work involved. Matthew Collinge from the Save our Slattocks group, which is opposed to homes being built on greenbelt land between Middleton and Royton, said the delay was "disappointing". He said: "It stretches out the fear of the unknown and us. It's very easy for people to lose interest and we've been working towards this September deadline. "We now have to keep people aware of what's happening for longer and that makes it harder for a small community group like ours." Matthew Good, a spokesman for the House Builder's Federation said: "It's important for everybody that we have some certainty on this. "Councils need to invest in infrastructure. They need to know where those developments are going to happen. "Without a plan it's going to be a lot more piecemeal because investors will have to take chances on where they can get development and the councils may not be in control of that." A spokesman for Mr Burnham said the mayor had appointed Salford City Mayor Paul Dennett to lead a "radical" rewrite of the plans. He added: "This re-write is currently underway and details on the next round of consultation will be announced in due course."	A plan earmarking sites for 225,000 new homes in Greater Manchester is set to be delayed amid a "radical rewrite" to help protect green belt land.
He said new forests would slow flooding by trapping water with their roots. The idea of "rewilding" the uplands is catching on fast as parts of Britain face repeated flooding, with more rainfall on the way. Environment Secretary Owen Paterson said he would seriously consider innovative solutions like rewilding. The government has been criticised for being slow to capitalise on the benefits of capturing rain where it falls. Lord Rooker, a Labour peer, said too much emphasis had been attached to the look of the countryside rather than practical considerations like trapping water. "We pay the farmers to grub up the trees and hedges; we pay them to plant the hills with pretty grass and sheep to maintain the chocolate box image, and then wonder why we've got floods," he said. The idea of reintroducing forests into catchments has been strongly supported by several leading scientists. The government is sponsoring a handful of catchment trials to assess the potential of the upstream areas to catch water and send it slowly downhill. A research paper for the Environment Agency shows that some of the schemes, like partly damming streams with felled trees to cause local flooding, are highly unpredictable when employed on their own. If they divert rainfall on to surrounding fields that can actually make flooding downstream worse if the water then flows off the fields, bypassing bends in the river. But the study, which is not yet peer-reviewed, suggests that reintroducing flood forests to upland areas can be highly effective - and potentially much cheaper than conventional flood defences. The author, Simon Dixon, said: "Complex forested floodplains dramatically slow water moving over them as they have an irregular surface covered by tree roots, upright tree trunks and dead wood." He explains the process this way: "As a simple analogy during a flood many 'packets' of water are delivered to the main trunk river from all its tributaries. "If the delivery of a single large 'packet' of water can be significantly delayed it will then arrive at the main river after the peak of the flood, and thus the main flood peak height has less 'packets' of water in it and is lower." The best results come, he says, when rivers are partly dammed and a forest is allowed to grow on the floodplain. "This shows substantial and predictable responses in downstream flood height," he said. This is exactly what would have happened if farmers had not been encouraged by government to maximise food production by felling forests to graze sheep on the uplands. Lord Rooker got the idea of reintroducing forests from an article by the green journalist George Monbiot, who complained that farmers are subsidised to keep sheep even though the grazing animals actually make flooding worse by compacting the earth. "Instead of a steady flow sustained around the year by trees in the hills, by sensitive farming methods, by rivers which are allowed to find their own course and their own level, to filter and hold back their waters through bends and braiding and obstructions, we get a cycle of flood and drought. We get filthy water and empty aquifers and huge insurance premiums and ruined carpets. And all of it at public expense," Mr Monbiot wrote earlier this month. The idea of catching water upstream is strongly supported by the water and environment professional body, the Chartered Institution of Water and Environmental Management (CIWEM). Its spokesman Katherine Pygott has previously told BBC News: "Flooding is getting worse with changing weather patterns, but these schemes are taking a very long time and a lot of energy. "Projects working with nature to reduce flood risk are needed right across the country - but it is complicated, with many different organisations involved, and it will need political leadership from the highest level to make it happen. So far we haven't seen that leadership." Environment Secretary Owen Paterson told me he would give serious consideration to innovative solutions to flooding, like rewilding. The government could theoretically encourage farmers to rewild key parts of their catchments using grants under the Common Agricultural Policy, but CIWEM say that at the moment it is much easier for farmers to get grants for wildlife protection than flood protection. Mr Paterson had hoped to divert more cash into a fund that could be used for these sort of measures but was overruled by the prime minister after a campaign by farmers demanding to keep the maximum amount of their grants into direct payments for farming - in effect, for owning land.

That steady stream of stories has led to the launch of a major public inquiry into their activities. The breadth and nature of what is being alleged is almost too big to grasp, but it fundamentally comes down to a simple question of whether elements of the police were out of control. So, here are seven key themes and allegations that lie in the road ahead - and some of the real practical and legal problems the inquiry faces. Some police officers had relationships with women whom they met within the protest movements they had been deployed to infiltrate. Last year, the Metropolitan Police paid one woman who had a child with an officer Â£425,000 in compensation. There are approximately a dozen civil claims for damages before the courts amid allegations that officers were expected to have relationships as part of their cover identity. But how many did so and under what circumstances? This is a huge challenge for the inquiry. How will it find out and inform the public if the undercover officer involved remains unknown, there are no records and, crucially, the partner never had any suspicions? During the 40-year history of the Special Demonstration Squad (SDS) - the police unit at the heart of many of the allegations - officers used 106 "covert identities". According to a published police review, some 42 of them were almost certainly taken from children who had died - and the parents did not know about it. In 2013, a senior officer said the practice wasn't sanctioned by Scotland Yard - yet it seemed to have gone on for years. How many names were used? Who authorised it? Should the parents have known? If the names of the dead children are revealed, will that identify the officers the police want to protect? The undercover affair has so far led to more than 50 convictions being quashed after a failure to disclose that officers had infiltrated protest groups later accused of criminality. The two largest cases relate to environmental protests at power stations, both of which involved Mark Kennedy, an officer with the National Public Order Intelligence Unit. He would drive protesters around, effectively facilitating demonstrations later found to have broken the law. A review for the Home Office said there could be a possible further 83 miscarriages of justice - although its author, Mark Ellison QC, couldn't be sure there were not more. So will the inquiry look at allegations that officers lied in court? John Jordan was convicted over his role in a protest in 1996 - but was cleared on appeal in 2013 after it emerged that his co-defendant was Jim Boyling, an undercover officer. The officer even gave evidence in character. Jordan has been taking legal action for a full explanation of what happened. Peter Francis, the only former SDS officer speaking publicly, says that Scotland Yard kept intelligence files on MPs during the 1990s. During his time in Special Branch, he says he saw files on 10 Labour MPs which he and others would regularly update. So what did that monitoring amount to? Was the information on MPs incidental, gathered as part of watching campaign groups? Or did some Scotland Yard chiefs want deeper intelligence on the MPs? Separate allegations have emerged that undercover officers also gathered information on some trade union activists. The most toxic allegation so far has been that Scotland Yard had a "spy" in the Lawrence family camp. He later had a meeting with a senior officer helping to prepare Scotland Yard for the public inquiry into the London teenager's murder. The exact nature of what information was gathered, why it was gathered and how it was used remains unclear. The then Metropolitan Police Commissioner and now peer, Lord Condon, has said that had he known of the existence of such undercover action in relation to the Lawrences, he would have stopped it. Peter Francis spent four years deep undercover and he eventually became mentally ill, suffering post-traumatic stress disorder. Today, he says some of what he was asked to do was wrong - and he wants senior officers to account for the way they deployed officers like him. He is not the only officer to have had concerns about the ethics of their work. Phase two of the inquiry is expected to look at the "operational governance and oversight" of undercover operations, including how officers are selected, trained, managed and cared for. The most important acronym in this inquiry stands for Neither Confirm Nor Deny. It's a legal position adopted by the police and other security agencies in cases involving protection of undercover officers or sensitive sources. The first potential legal battle will come if police will refuse to admit whether or not they had officers deployed in specific circumstances. Official reports have already revealed the existence of some of these undercover officers - such as the one who was in a campaign group close to the Lawrence family - but they remain anonymous. If officers remain in the shadows because, quite simply, they were incredibly good at their job, police chiefs will almost certainly argue that the public interest lies in protecting their anonymity because of their legal duty of care.	The allegations of wrongdoing by undercover police officers that have emerged since 2011 have been extraordinary.
The militants do not meet in such large numbers in "one spot" because of the threat of an attack, a spokesman said. He did not give details of casualties. A resident said that al-Shabab had arrested several people from the remote central Somali village of Raso, after the US bombed its training camp in a nearby forested area on Saturday. The US said the strike,  by both drones and manned aircraft, was aimed at preventing a "large-scale attack" by the al-Qaeda-linked militants. The resident told the BBC Somali service that al-Shabab recruits from around Somalia had been converging on the camp, about 195km (120 miles) north of the capital, Mogadishu, since last week. The US strike appeared to have led to heavy casualties, with al-Shabab reinforcements arriving to collect the dead, the resident added. Fighters who survived the assault had now left the area, he said. A spokesman for al-Shabab, Sheikh Abdiasis Abu Musab, confirmed to Reuters news agency that the US had bombed an area controlled by the militants. However, the US had exaggerated the number of casualties, he said. "We never gather 100 fighters in one spot for security reasons. We know the sky is full of planes," the spokesman added. On Tuesday, Pentagon spokesman Capt Jeff Davis said that initial assessments were that more than 150 fighters had been killed at the training facility. The camp had been under surveillance for some time, Capt Davis said. "We know they were going to be departing the camp and they posed an imminent threat to US and [African Union] forces," he added. A Somali official said their intelligence service cooperated with the US ahead of the air strikes, the Associated Press news agency reports. The US has a huge military base in neighbouring Djibouti. In a 2008 strike, it killed al-Shabab leader Adan Hashi Ayro. His successor Ahmed Godane was killed in a 2014 strike. 28 February - on a restaurant and busy junction in Baidoa killing at least 30 people 26 February - on Mogadishu's SYL hotel killing nine people 21 January - on a restaurant at Mogadishu's Lido beach killing 20 people 15 January - on a Kenyan base in el-Ade that Somalia's president said killed at least 180 soldiers	Militant Islamist group al-Shabab has dismissed as exaggerated US claims that more than 150 of its fighters were killed in an air strike in Somalia.
The Kings, who play in Port Elizabeth, and the Bloemfontein-based Cheetahs are expected to join the league after losing their Super Rugby status. The Pro12 comprises teams from Scotland, Wales, Ireland and Italy. "A lot of the players at South African teams would prefer playing in the Pro12," van Rooyen told BBC Scotland. "Most of the guys are really excited to play in the northern hemisphere - it's a new challenge, a new type of game, playing new opposition that you don't know at all." Van Rooyen, 25, says the players have not been informed of their immediate future after the Kings' exit from Super Rugby was confirmed by the national governing body on Friday. He hopes a berth in the Pro12 would create opportunities for him to impress Springboks selectors - and carve out a more lucrative career path in Europe. "Most of the South Africans want to earn their pounds or their Euros and I think playing in Europe, playing against Munster or Ulster, the big teams from Ireland or Scotland or Wales can certainly put your foot in the door a bit," Van Rooyen said. "The only way people in Europe can see you play is clips and games that you send them, but once you start playing against them week in, week out, they can know more about you as a person and how you play. "I've got only about four, five, six years left - you have to make your pounds or your Euros. Playing against the European teams week in, week out, should hopefully make a way for us to get overseas just by playing against the teams there. "We're going to play more of a kicking game against the northern hemisphere teams because it is wet most of the time - maybe that's what the Springboks selectors want for certain games. "So I think it can really help us to become Boks or to get that big contract in Europe to help you get financial stability for after rugby. "It can be a huge door to be opened for South Africans wanting to make a few bucks before their time runs out with rugby." An ankle injury limited Van Rooyen to two Super Rugby appearances this season, with the Kings' campaign coming to a close against the Cheetahs on 14 July. They have won six of their 14 matches and sit bottom of the Africa 2 conference. Deon Davids' side are expected to join the Pro12 for the coming season, which should begin in September, and their scrum-half believes that, with a deeper player pool, his team can be very competitive. "The bodies have taken a few shots now, but the type of game is totally different," he said. "It's a slower game, so you can manage the bodies a bit better. You just have to get the right squad, with enough guys in specific positions for depth, because it is such a long competition. "But I think the excitement of the new competition could really boost that. Tiring bodies is one thing, but if you know you can tour Ireland or Scotland, that's a big motivator. "The first season might get a bit long, but our depth was tested in Super Rugby and we did exceptionally well. "We've shown this year we're a great running side - I think we can bring something new to the Pro12, more running than kicking, and I think that will be good for the Pro12. "Talent-wise we've really stepped up and I think we can be a threat. I don't see why we'd have to stand back for big teams like Munster. "I really think we can make our stamp in the first year and build on that. I think, if you just get through the first year and see how things work, you can build on that. I think we can really be contenders growing into the Pro12." Van Rooyen insists "there will be big crowds" for Pro12 opposition at the Kings' Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium and admits playing against Munster at Thomond Park would be "a dream come true". "I watch European rugby week in, week out, and I think a lot of players here do," he added. "For me, the Pro12 is an awesome competition and it's a long competition, so you need a big group. "The Pro12 has good talent - it's not a watered-down competition, it's very fierce and competitive and that's exactly what you want. I'd love to be part of it."	South African players are excited by the prospect of competing in the Pro12, according to Southern Kings scrum-half Rudi van Rooyen.
Coventry University's Scarborough campus has been built on the town's former Weaponness Park and Ride site. About 200 students have begun courses at the site, though it is expected to eventually be home to more than 2,000 students. The building, which includes engineering and science labs, a mock law court and a library, is part of a £50m sports and education facility. Professor Craig Gaskell said: "Launching our new state-of-the-art building is a huge milestone for us and demonstrates our commitment to Scarborough and the Yorkshire coast area." A new University Technical College has been built nearby and Scarborough Athletic FC's new 2,000-seater stadium is also under construction on the site. Coventry University also has a campus near London's Liverpool Street Station and recently announced it will open a campus in Dagenham in September 2017.	A new £14m university campus has opened in Scarborough.
The interim review of Liverpool's green and open spaces, commissioned by Mayor Joe Anderson, suggests an extra Â£4.50 contribution is needed per person. The proposal to increase council tax is one of 31 recommendations made in green activist Simon O'Brien's report. He warned that Liverpool was "heading to a brick wall" when it comes to maintaining open spaces in the city. Mr Anderson explained: "Sadly, the 58% cut to our budget by central government has left us grappling with the challenge of finding new ways to fund non-essential services, including maintenance of and investment in our green and open spaces." Former Brookside actor Mr O'Brien said: "As central government is cutting money left, right and centre, non-statutory provision is the first thing that goes. "I've suggested other things like tourist levies, which you can only set up nationally unfortunately. I think if we charge everyone who comes to stay in the city Â£1 a head, this problem goes away but we're not allowed to do that yet. "If I can see a way that maybe you could commercialise a park - perhaps you could put a cafÃ© or a health centre in and bring in revenue - that's good." He called for residents to give their feedback before a final report is produced.	A city's parks could be funded by an increase in council tax, a report has recommended.

Nashat Melhem was tracked down to a mosque in his home town of Arara and killed in a gun battle, police said. The attacks sparked a huge hunt and security alert across the country. Police said Melhem, 29, was the gunman who killed two Israelis at a bar, then the Israeli Arab driver of a taxi who picked him up after the attack. Security camera footage showed a suspect taking an automatic rifle out of his backpack and then firing at least 15 shots at people in the street before fleeing the scene. Alon Bakal, 26, who was a manager at the bar, and Shimon Ruimi, 30, were killed. Taxi driver Amin Shaban died after being found critically injured in the north of the city shortly after the shootings. Melhem's father, Mohammed, identified his son as the suspect and reported him to the police. Mohammed Melhem and several relatives have been arrested in connection with the case. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu congratulated security forces, who he said had "worked tirelessly, methodically and professionally to locate and eliminate the terrorist". Police spokeswoman Luba Samri said Melhem was shot dead after opening fire. A witness, Hakim Younis, told Israel's Channel 10 TV he saw a fierce gun battle, the Associated Press news agency reported "I was sitting on my balcony with my cousin... when suddenly shooting began, hundreds of bullets, like in a war," he said. Police have not yet established a motive for the Tel Aviv killings. Israel was already on high alert amid a wave of attacks on Israelis by Palestinians and some Israeli Arabs which have killed 22 Israelis since the beginning of October. During that time 149 Palestinians - more than half said by Israel to be attackers - have been shot dead by security forces or their victims. Others have been killed in clashes with Israeli forces. One Israeli Arab was also shot dead after carrying out an attack at a bus station in southern Israel in October in which an Israeli soldier was killed.	An Israeli Arab wanted for shooting dead three people in Tel Aviv on 1 January has been killed by security forces in northern Israel.

The 34th America's Cup, to be held in San Francisco in September 2013, will come too early for the Briton. "I've had some America's Cup experience in the past and I would really love to be part of a winning team in the future," said Ainslie. "As a kid my main two goals were the Olympics and the America's Cup." He will sail a catamaran under his Ben Ainslie Racing (BAR) banner, with JP Morgan announced as the main sponsor for the team, and will enter the upcoming America's Cup World Series, which starts in San Francisco on 21 August. "We started a new team, JP Morgan BAR, which will take part in the America's Cup World Series," he said. "It will take part in this coming series and the one after, which is really a great opportunity for us to build this team up. "The next America's Cup is in 2013 and we want to try and build this team up for the World Series so we can be a proper challenger for the America's Cup post-2013." Ainslie won his fourth Olympic gold in a row by coming home first in the Finn class at Weymouth, a victory that makes him the most decorated Olympic sailor in history.	Olympic hero Ben Ainslie has outlined his plans to win the America's Cup.
The incident, in a village in western Bengkulu province, sparked a rare debate in Indonesia about sexual violence. The maximum penalty would have been 15 years each, but the judge said he took into account the boys' youth. The girl, Yuyun, went missing on 2 April on her way back from school. Her body was found in undergrowth two days later by villagers, bruised, beaten and with her hands tied. The case was not widely covered by Indonesian media until it was picked up by activists online several weeks later. That led to protests in the capital, Jakarta, and prompted the Minister for Child Protection Yohana Yembise to call for rapists to face the death penalty. Five men are also facing trial in connection with the case, and police say two more suspects are still on the run.	Seven boys below the age of 18 have been sentenced to 10 years in jail each in Indonesia for the gang rape and murder of a 14-year-old girl.
Mitchell won the women's 5,000m title as she clocked 16:27.08 to finish over eight seconds ahead of Letterkenny's Annmarie McGlynn. Queen's athlete Mitchell has achieved Commonwealth Games consideration standards in the 5,000m and 10,000m. Derry Track Club's Kirk-Smith won the men's 3,000m steeplechase in 8:55.72. Kirk-Smith has also bettered the steeplechase Commonwealth Games consideration standard. His winning time left him over 22 seconds ahead of runner-up Clonliffe's Jayme Rossiter. Ciara Mageean eased into Sunday's 800m final with a dominant heat performance. World Championships-bound Mageean clocked 2:11.92 which left her ahead of City of Lisburn's Kelly Neely, who ran 2:13.13 to also progress. Letterkenny man Mark English won his 800m heat in 1:53.35 to qualify for the men's decider. Raheny's Kevin Dooney won the men's 10,000m title in 29:30.16 as he finished over five seconds ahead of marathon specialist Mick Clohisey. Cork athlete Phil Healy won the women's 200m title in 23.56 seconds while Carrick-on-Shannon's Eanna Madden was just outside 21 seconds as he took the men's title in 21.07 with Clonliffe's Jeremy Phillips second in 21.14. Marcus Lawler was an absentee from the men's event because of injury with Amy Foster skipping the women's 200m to concentrate on Sunday's 100m. In-form Brian Gregan led the qualifiers for Sunday's 400m final where Ballymena & Antrim's Craig Newell will also be in action. Sunday will be the main day of finals action at the Santry meeting with Thomas Barr and Kerry O'Flaherty, Ben Reynolds and Adam McMullan among the athletes who will compete, while Mitchell will aim to complete a double in the women's 1500m final.	Commonwealth Games hopefuls Emma Mitchell and Adam Kirk-Smith both clinched gold medals on the opening day of the Irish Championships at Santry.
It is certainly the most quotable, and without question the most revelatory: inside a previously hidden world, showing sport as raw and brutal and beautiful and comic, aped many times but never quite matched. Living With Lions, the fly-on-the-kitbag story of the 1997 British and Irish Lions tour of South Africa, is 20 years old. It came to both define that epic trip, and give it an eternal youth. Two decades on, a special BBC Radio 5 Live programme has brought together the men who made it and those who became its unwitting stars. This is the inside story of the ultimate inside story. Cameraman and director Duncan Humphries (DH): "My mate Fred and I had been making commercials about mops and buckets. We were looking for something more fun to do, so we went to the pub at midday. By 3.30pm we had this blinding idea: why not do a film about the Lions?" Director Fred Rees (FR): "We went to tour manager Fran Cotton. He said: 'Sounds like a good idea, it'll cost you thirty grand.' "My father and I, who ran a production company, decided we'd take the risk, because we were told by Fran and everyone else that once we had the rights then BBC or ITV would come on board and give us the money to actually make it. So we paid the £30,000, and went to the BBC and ITV, and instead they all said: 'You're mad, the Lions are never going to win, no-one's going to want to watch this film, we won't give you any money.' "We were terrified. What do we do now? We're on the edge of a cliff. Either we've lost all this money, or we have to find a whole load more to make the film. So, in great stupidity or wisdom, we remortgaged my house." Winger John Bentley (JB): "These two may have had a conversation with Fran, but [coaches] Ian McGeechan and Jim Telfer actually objected to their presence. They didn't want a circus. They decided to ignore these guys. "On the first Friday, all the players went for a drink. These boys were there. They explained they wanted to do it fly-on-the-wall. I told them they wouldn't get it, and they needed a player to help them." DH: "We all got full Lions training kit. So every day we filmed with them we were wearing the same kit as them. Straight away we started blending into the background. "It had never been agreed that we could put microphones on Telfer and McGeechan. But we just did it, every day. And they assumed it must have been in the contract. Which it wasn't." FR: "We lived in a limbo. We weren't the journalists, and we weren't the team. We lived in a place in between. We were ignored most of the time, which was great for the film. You don't want people conscious you are filming them." JB: "If it's any consolation, Martin Johnson ignored all the players too." Minutes before the opening tour match, against Eastern Province, captain Jason Leonard gathered his team-mates around him in a tight circle. His speech - set against the sound of clattering studs, nervous retching and wild exhortations ("Squeeze the arms! Squeeze!") - was Churchill meets Barking via several broken noses ("What more do you want to achieve? It's there for us…"). We nearly never knew it happened. DH: "Before he called the lads together, Jason threw us out. So Fred and I had a conflab, and we thought, if we don't get in the first dressing room, by the time the Tests come round we won't have a chance. We had to get in there. "So we went to see Fran. 'Fran, we shook hands on this.' 'Leave it to me.' Fran walked in, tapped Jason on the shoulder with his big hand, and that was it - we were in." JB: "The camera had never been in a Lions dressing room. Neither had I. But we didn't even notice they were there." FR: "There was a lot of swearing. We had one 20-second section with Keith Wood where he dropped 13 f-bombs. "We phoned him up afterwards and told him. He said: 'Yeah, that sounds a bit much. I might have to open a supermarket or something.' So we halved the swearing, and when we played it back to him, he said: 'That really doesn't sound like me - you better put it all back in.' JB: The phantom puker was Neil Jenkins. And sometimes Keith Wood too." The hand-held camera Bentley asked for was passed on to team-mate Rob Wainwright and then his fellow Scot Doddie Weir. While Weir's first attempt at self-filming did not go well ("Take two, because in part one I had a wee swear…") the next few weeks revealed just how strong a bond a Lions tour can forge - and what it's like when that bond is forcibly broken. In the tour match against Mpumalanga, Weir's knee was wrecked by a brutal stamp at a ruck. When he was told in the dressing room by doctor James Robson that his tour was over, Humphries' camera was there to capture his reaction. Media playback is not supported on this device Doddie Weir (DW): "You say it breaks your heart to watch it. It broke mine too. "I tried to look cheerful for the boys. It's the way I've always been, to show a positive side. But I was going home, and it had been a wonderful trip and a wonderful tour. "The rugby was pretty special, yet the biggest wrench for me was leaving the 35 players. Bentos [John Bentley] was pretty special. He was my new mate. Leaving that was the biggest thing. The video picked that up, and our camaraderie." DH: "It was close to feeling like I was intruding on private grief. Bentos and Rob and Doddie had been so brilliant and open to us, and so you'd developed more of a relationship with them. "Witnessing Doddie - who had been playing so well on that tour - there was a moment when you wondered about turning the camera off. But you stay, and if someone says 'sod off', you sod off slightly slower. "When I stopped filming, I said: 'Doddie, I'm really sorry.' It wasn't a nice thing to film, but it shows Doddie as the person he is." DW: "I was a shy boy. Meeting John Bentley, who was the main social convenor, really opened my eyes." JB: "There were some lonely days. My wife had the tour itinerary, and she would send letters and photos of the kids. My daughter was six months old when I left, and she was changing in front of my eyes. It was a big ask for me. "After I went to see Doddie to say goodbye, I went back to my room and cried my eyes out. I didn't want to be there then. And Doddie was the nicest man in the world. I love you Doddie, I really do." DW: "You're pretty special, Bentos. You're my favourite." JB: "I really love you. This is a wonderful opportunity to tell everyone you love me. Tell me you love me. Please." DW: "I'll text you." Media playback is not supported on this device After beating Western Province, the squad retired to Cantina Tequila in Cape Town for a few beers. And then several more. With champagne. And tequila. And a lot of singing - even from Martin Johnson. FR: "The Lions weren't holding back, so we didn't think they minded filming it. We just rocked up." DH: "I went in the car with Jonno and Geech [Ian McGeechan]. By then we were part of the trip." JB: "We had a great night. It finished some time on Monday. That's the real side of touring. "People ask why Wonderwall became such a big song for us. We were in the bar that night, and it just came on. We didn't choose it. We hadn't played it in the dressing room.  Rugby tours are all about singing, but that just came on and we all sang it. "The words just worked. 'I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do, about you now…'" DH: "We wish you'd chosen another song, because it cost us a fortune in rights to use it." Media playback is not supported on this device Forwards coach Telfer was a man possessed on that tour. Convinced - correctly - the Test series would be won or lost up front, he hammered his forwards on the training pitch, then stirred their souls afterwards. The lines have lost little of their power over the past two decades. "There are two types of rugby players boys - honest ones, and the rest…" "This is your (bleep) Everest, boys. Very few ever get a chance in rugby terms to get for the top of Everest. You have the chance today. "They don't think (bleep) all of us. Nothing. We're here just to make up the (bleep) numbers… "You have to find your own solace - your own drive, your ambition, your own inner strength. Because the moment's arrived for the greatest game of your (bleep) life." DH: "We used to call Jim 'Grandad', although not to his face. He was this gentle, grey-haired man. And then he would turn up for training, and this monster would appear." FR: "It's one of the magic things, that we managed to capture Jim and Ian making these amazing speeches. They have no ego, those two. "It wasn't about them, and them feeling they were achieving. It was all about the players. Jim's words, and his delivery, are gold." DH: "You would hear Jim rehearsing, all grumbling and mumbling. And then he would deliver it perfectly, and you would think, 'Where did that come from?'" JB: "We talk about groundbreaking footage for the viewers. I'd never seen those speeches. None of the backs had. They were made to the forwards. None of the forwards had mentioned it. I watched it, and thought, 'Wow!'" Ian McGeechan (IM): "It's the happiest I've ever seen Jim. That was him coming out. It was brilliant." JB: "It was magical footage. You couldn't script it. That wasn't pantomime; that wasn't done for the camera. They were just lucky to have caught it." DH: "I was a table away when I filmed it, but I don't think they even knew we were there. They were so, so focused. "I remember the build-up to the Everest one. The sound man said: 'Jim's off on one…' He was grumbling, he was mumbling, doing the rehearsals in his own mind. I thought, 'Don't muck this zoom up.'" Three hours before the second Test, with the Lions 80 minutes away from a historic series win, McGeechan sat his players down in the team hotel. His speech would be different in tone to those of Telfer, but its impact was just as significant: "On that field sometimes today, all it will be between you is a look. No words, just a look. That will say everything. And the biggest thing it will say is 'you are special'." JB: "That Geech speech smashes me." FR: "There's so much heart in there. There is something very beautiful about that speech." JB: "I was sat there crying. Crying, and scared to lift my hand to my face because of the crying. "Because he spoke about the things that were outside the room, like your family. I missed mine so badly. I hadn't seen them for seven weeks. All of us did. Geech understood." DH: "We had two Churchillian speakers. A few years later, the speeches on behind-the-scenes films felt too rehearsed. But there were times when I was filming when you could feel the hairs on the back of your neck rising." Tour over, series won, Fred sat down to edit the hundreds of hours of footage down to just under three hours. DH: "The blokes who ran the four Home Unions were shocked, when they came to watch it, by all the swearing." FR: "We played them the final sequence. When Jerry Guscott drops the winning drop-goal in the second Test, [chairman of the Lions committee] Ray Williams leapt to his feet and shouted: 'Yes!' They were OK with the swearing after that." JB: "When we had the tour reunion, Fred and Duncan came to it. They became like friends." FR: "The film is two hours 50 minutes long. The Lions win the Test series in the last five minutes. If they'd lost the series, it would still have been the same film. "We knew we'd made something pretty magical. We released it as a VHS, and it quite quickly became the most successful rugby video there had been. You can never know how the world will react, but we knew we had something special." DH: "In 2005 I was filming an advert with Jonno and Brian O'Driscoll. Brian was asked what got him into rugby. He replied that the Living With Lions film had been one of the big reasons. "Jonno started laughing. 'This bloke made it.' Brian took my hand, shook it and said: 'Thank you very much.'" JB: "Everyone around me said it should have been called 'Living With John Bentley'. "I heard from the tour press officer when the film had been put together, and was told that I should have a look before it came out. So I went into the garden, and shared the news with my wife of what I'd been doing. "She went ballistic. 'You were supposed to be playing rugby! What the hell were you doing? Why are you having to look at it?' "A week or so later, I was away playing with Newcastle. I phoned home to see how the kids were. My wife told me a package had arrived for me. "'Oh really?' 'Yes, it's a video from your trip to South Africa.' "'Oh God…' "'Well I've watched it, John, and it's just you being an idiot. As usual.'" IM: "My wife tells me that when she's feeling depressed, Living With Lions is one of the videos she puts on. For that moment in time, it was the watershed moment. The Lions were here to stay."	It might just be the greatest sports documentary to ever come out of Britain.
The Cherries went down 2-1 at Sunderland on Saturday, becoming the first team to lose to the Black Cats in the Premier League this season. Dan Gosling's goal, which gave them the lead, was their first for three games. "It shouldn't be down to a lack of confidence," Howe told BBC Radio Solent. "We scored six goals against Hull prior to these two games." He continued: "A couple of weeks later, if you were to put the chances we've created together into a clip sequence, the fact that we haven't even scored one goal is difficult to take." Bournemouth were stunned by goals for Sunderland from Victor Anichebe and a Jermain Defoe penalty and they were unable to find an equaliser, even against 10 men following Steven Pienaar's dismissal. "We've had enough chances to win three games today," Howe added. "Sometimes football pans out that way and you have to accept it. It's how you move on from that which is key."	Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe admits his side's sudden lack of confidence in front of goal is "baffling".
The 29-year-old, from Cornwall, started his career at Penryn and has played for Exeter Chiefs and Rotherham, as well as spending time playing in Spain. "He's impressed us - he is renowned for his work-rate, physicality and passion," said coach Gavin Cattle. Alex O'Meara and Alex Day have agreed new one-year contracts, with hooker Tom Channon signing for two more seasons. Wing O'Meara, 24, has spent two years at the Mennaye, while scrum-half Day has played 52 games in his time at the club. Channon joined from Bristol in 2013 and is three games short of making 100 appearances. Pirates are sixth in the Championship with two games to go, and now have 19 players confirmed for next term.	Cornish Pirates have agreed to sign lock Toby Freeman from Nottingham on a two-year deal, starting next season.
An ISI official told the BBC the compound in Abbottabad where Bin Laden was killed by US forces on Sunday had been raided several years ago. But the compound "was not on our radar" since then, the official said. The government of Pakistan has categorically denied any knowledge of the raid before it took place. No base within Pakistan was used by US forces, the ministry of foreign affairs said in a statement. It went on: "US helicopters entered Pakistani airspace making use of blind spots in the radar coverage due to hilly terrain." However, the ministry defended the ISI, saying: "As far as the target compound is concerned, ISI had been sharing information with CIA and other friendly intelligence agencies since 2009." Bin Laden, 54, was the founder and leader of al-Qaeda. He is believed to have ordered the attacks on New York and Washington on 11 September 2001, as well as a number of other deadly bombings. The ISI official gave new details of the raid, saying Bin Laden's young daughter had said she saw her father shot. He told the BBC's Owen Bennett-Jones in Islamabad that the compound in Abbottabad, just 100km (62 miles) from the capital, was raided when under construction in 2003. It was believed an al-Qaeda operative, Abu Faraj al-Libi, was there. But since then, "the compound was not on our radar, it is an embarrassment for the ISI", the official said. "We're good, but we're not God." He added: "This one failure should not make us look totally incompetent. Look at our track record. For the last 10 years, we have captured Taliban and al-Qaeda in their hundreds - more than any other countries put together." The compound is about a kilometre from the Pakistan Military Academy - the country's equivalent of West Point or Sandhurst. The ISI official also gave new or differing accounts of some of the events of Sunday's raid. They included: The official said it was thought the Americans wanted to take away the surviving women and children but had to abandon the plan when one of the helicopters malfunctioned. By Owen Bennett-JonesBBC News, Islamabad Clearly there were people helping Bin Laden in this location... were they state employees, were they simply from Taliban-related groups, were they from the intelligence agencies? For all Americans may ask the questions, I doubt they will get any answers. There will be ambiguity about this and the Pakistanis will deny they had any knowledge whatsoever. The establishment here is made up of army leadership, intelligence agency leadership and some senior civil servants, and they have always run Pakistan, whether democratic governments or military governments, and those people do have connections with jihadis. The difficulty the West has is in appreciating there are more than 20 different types of jihadi organisations, and al-Qaeda is just one of them. The state has different policies towards different types of group and that subtlety is often lost on Western policy-makers. The helicopter was destroyed by the special forces unit. The US has not commented on anyone it captured or had planned to capture, other than saying it had taken Bin Laden's body. The ISI official said the organisation had recovered some documents from the compound. The CIA is already said to be going through a large number of hard drives and storage devices seized in the raid. The White House has not disclosed whether anyone has claimed the $25m (Â£15m) reward for leading the US to Bin Laden. White House counter-terrorism adviser John Brennan said there had been concern Pakistani forces would deploy to counter the US Navy Seal team conducting the raid but it had avoided any confrontation. The ISI official said: "We were totally caught by surprise. They were in and out before we could react." Our correspondent says residents near the compound in Abbottabad reported that Pakistani soldiers had asked them to switch off their lights an hour before the attack, but the ISI official said this was not true and that it had no advance knowledge of the raid. Earlier, in an opinion piece in the Washington Post, President Asif Ali Zardari admitted Bin Laden "was not anywhere we had anticipated he would be". But he denied the killing suggested Pakistan was failing in its efforts to tackle terrorism. Mr Zardari said Pakistan had "never been and never will be the hotbed of fanaticism that is often described by the media". "Such baseless speculation may make exciting cable news, but it doesn't reflect fact," he said. "Pakistan had as much reason to despise al-Qaeda as any nation. The war on terrorism is as much Pakistan's war as it is America's." Mr Brennan had said it was "inconceivable that Bin Laden did not have a support system" in Pakistan. He estimated Bin Laden had been living in the compound in Abbottabad for five or six years. Pakistani Foreign Secretary Salman Bashir tried to draw a line under the matter, saying: "Who did what is beside the point... This issue of Osama Bin Laden is history." Bin Laden was America's most wanted man but had eluded capture for more than a decade. US officials say that after DNA tests they are "99.9%" sure that the man they shot and killed and later buried at sea was Bin Laden. US President Barack Obama watched the entire operation in real time in the White House with his national security team. Mr Brennan said: "The minutes passed like days." CIA director Leon Panetta narrated via a video screen from a separate Washington office, with Bin Laden given the code name Geronimo. Mr Panetta's narration lasted several minutes. "They've reached the target... We have a visual on Geronimo... Geronimo EKIA (enemy killed in action)." Mr Obama said: "We got him." Bin Laden, his son Khalid, trusted personal courier Sheikh Abu Ahmed and the courier's brother were all killed, along with an unidentified woman. Bin Laden was shot above his left eye, blowing away a section of his skull, and was also shot in the chest. The BBC's Andrew North in Washington says the White House is still discussing whether to release a video that was made of Bin Laden's burial from an aircraft carrier in the Arabian Sea, which some Islamic scholars have said did not conform with tradition. Our correspondent says many people will want proof that Bin Laden is dead but the White House will be concerned about the reaction if the video, and still photographs of the body, are released.	Pakistan's main intelligence agency, the ISI, has said it is embarrassed by its failures on al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden.
Lagavulin is launching a single cask edition of 522 bottles of its single malt to raise funds for local projects. Sales of the £1,494 bottles are set to see £310,000 donated to Islay Heritage to help build a story of the island's past based on its archaeological sites. The Finlaggan Trust, which maintains the historical home of the Lord of the Isles, should also receive £60,000. The Lagavulin 200 Legacy is set to make further contributions to the local swimming pool, cyber cafe and arts and festival organisations, as well as a new partnership with the RSPB to restore and conserve peatlands on the island. Nick Morgan, of Lagavulin's owners Diageo, said: "We have had a fantastic year celebrating the 200th anniversary of Lagavulin, both on Islay and with the hundreds of thousands of people around the world who adore the whisky. "Islay and its remarkable local community are at the heart of Lagavulin. "That's why we were determined there should be a legacy from the anniversary which would directly benefit the island and its people. "We believe that our contribution to Islay Heritage is not only of great significance to the island itself but is an important contribution to conserving and promoting the history and heritage of Scotland." Bottles of the Lagavulin 1991 Single Malt Scotch Whisky cask can only be purchased through an online ballot on The Whisky Exchange. The first bottle will be auctioned separately to raise more charitable funds, and one bottle will be donated to the Diageo Archive and the Whisky Exchange. Steven Mithen, trustee of Islay Heritage and professor of archaeology, said: "Islay Heritage is hugely grateful to the Lagavulin 200 Legacy for the support it is providing to further our knowledge about the archaeological sites and monuments on Islay. "This investment in our heritage will greatly benefit both the local community and visitors to the island. "While some of Islay's sites and monuments are very well known and accessible, others are virtually unknown, difficult to find and rarely visited. "There are no doubt many more waiting to be discovered which will help tell us more about not only Islay's story but that of Scotland, Europe and the path of human culture as a whole. "We are delighted that Lagavulin shares our vision to reveal Islay's past so that it can be explored and enjoyed by everyone."	A whisky distillery plans to invest £580,000 in community projects to mark its 200 years on the island of Islay.
The Iridis4 has state of the art coprocessors which can each perform a trillion calculations per second - a measurement known as a "teraflop". The university said the new machine would allow academics to work on more projects at faster speeds. Iridis4 will be used for subjects such as engineering, archaeology and medicine, as well as computer science. Pro vice-chancellor Prof Philip Nelson said: "Staying ahead of the game in high performance computing [HPC] is vital to help the university stay competitive. "Simulation and computation enabled by HPC are recognised globally as the third pillar of modern research and this investment will ensure we remain world leaders in this field." Iridis4 will be used for a range of research, including engineering, archaeology and medicine, as well as computer science. The world's most powerful computer is China's Tianhe-2, which can perform 33,860 trillion calculations per second. The university said its new computer ranked among the top 10 in the UK. The most powerful is at the Science and Technology Facilities Council in Warrington. Others are based at the University of Edinburgh, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts and the United Kingdom Meteorological Office.	A £3.2m supercomputer, one of the most powerful in the UK, has been installed at the University of Southampton.
Across the UK there were 96,910 residential transactions in June, on a seasonally-adjusted basis. That is a fall of 3.3% on May's number, and the lowest total since October 2016. The figures, from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC), represent a small annual rise, up 1% in comparison with June 2016. However, last summer's sales were depressed by the introduction of additional stamp duty rates in April. It is also the first time this year that the number of transactions has fallen below 100,000 a month. Property experts think the figures give a more accurate indication of the health of the market than house prices. "These figures are disappointing as we would have expected them to be much higher bearing in mind the turmoil in the market this time last year following the introduction of the stamp duty surcharge," said Jeremy Leaf, a north London estate agent. Where can I afford to live?	The number of homes being bought and sold has fallen for the third month in a row, according to government figures.
Diamond, 47, says some internationals could join Sale at the AJ Bell Stadium in time for next season. "We're in talks with four or five international players to join us," he told BBC Radio Manchester. "We're well on the way to bringing some real experienced quality players to the club next year." Diamond said there is no urgency to bring in players and that he was happy with the way the club plans to bring in recruitments. "I don't need to rush into signing players. We've got a good protocol with how we find our players and it's not let us down yet in five years," he said. "There's offers gone and there's offers been accepted, we've just got to tie the details up. "There's one or two people who have decided to come to Sale for less money than they're being offered. "They've got mates who are here and they've asked the question. How do they run it? What's it like? "One or two of these are leaving big clubs to come here which will be a statement when we announce them."	Sale Sharks director of rugby Steve Diamond says the club will not rush into making signings and insists they will bring in "quality" talent.
It was a "good opportunity" and "a chance to work together," a top Western Sahara official told the BBC. Morocco controls two-thirds of Western Sahara and sees it as part of its historic territory. However some, including the UN, see Western Sahara as Africa's last colony. Africa Live: More on this and other stories Find out more about Western Sahara A referendum was promised in 1991 but never carried out due to wrangling over who was eligible to vote. Thousands of Sahrawi refugees still live in refugee camps in Algeria - some have been there for 40 years. It is not clear what happens next but Western Sahara is hopeful that a committee set up by the AU will address the issues that both sides have raised. Some AU delegates said that it would be easier to resolve the issue with Morocco inside the AU. Sidi Mohammed, a Western Sahara official, told the BBC that Morocco's return to the AU means that it would now be expected to put "in practice decisions taken by the AU with regard to a referendum in Western Sahara". Mr Mohammed dismissed the suggestion that Morocco would now seek to get the AU to change its position, saying that the no country could unilaterally change the AU fundamental agreement, saying it opposed colonisation. In his speech at the AU summit, King Mohammed VI of Morocco said the readmission was not meant to divide the continental body. No. Algeria has always been a big supporter of Western Sahara's Polisario Front and it had wanted Morocco to accept independence of the territory as a condition for readmission. Zimbabwe and South Africa were also supportive of this stance but they were outnumbered by those who wanted Morocco back in the fold. There is no specific provision in the AU charter that bars any country from joining it. Morocco simply applied and the request was accepted by more than two-thirds of the 53 members. Morocco has been involved in intense lobbying and applied in July last year to rejoin the continental body. King Mohammed toured various African countries seeking support for the bid. No. While culturally the country's identity aligns with Arab states, its economic interests increasingly lie in Africa. This is a strategic move to continue exploring its interests in mining, construction, medical, insurance and banking sectors on the continent. Moroccan troops went into Western Sahara after Spain withdrew in 1975.

Devon and Cornwall Chief Constable Shaun Sawyer told PCC Tony Hogg in a 2014 letter that moving his office to the force headquarters "sends the wrong signal" financially. He added it could threaten Mr Hogg's impartiality in overseeing the police. The commissioner said he would remain impartial and the cost would be repaid in four to five years. Read more on this story as it develops throughout the day on our Local Live pages. The disagreement emerged in an exchange of letters in 2014 seen by the BBC after a freedom of information request to Devon and Cornwall Police. The force confirmed that the chief constable remains concerned about the move, the cost of which has been estimated by the crime commissioner. Mr Hogg currently rents office space at Pynes Hill Business Park in Exeter, which costs about £100,000 a year. The lease runs out this year, and the commissioner plans to move less than a mile to the Middlemoor complex, where the chief constable and senior officers are based. Almost four years on from their creation, the initial term of office of the first police and crime commissioners is almost complete. In that time, the public, and senior police officers, have become more used to the powerful officials. But, as this row demonstrates, commissioners are no less controversial. And that should make for interesting times as we approach the elections for the new commissioners, in May. A letter seen by the BBC from Mr Sawyer to Mr Hogg in May 2014 said: "I am not convinced this adds up strategically, operationally or financially. "I cannot think of a worse time for the OPCC (Office of Police and Crime Commissioner) or the Force to divert time or energy from the job in hand." He added: "I fear the public would see this as not the best use of your time or their money." The commissioner replied that the plan was part of a review of the number of buildings Devon and Cornwall Police own or lease, and designed to bring about "short, medium and long term savings". Andrew White, chief executive of the Office of the Police and Crime Commissioner, said in a statement: "The building doesn't decide if the commissioner is impartial or not. "I think it will mean an improvement for the public because we'll be spending less money on our estate... so more money will go to policing and that's the most important thing about this change." Mr Hogg is expected to decide on whether to go ahead with the move later this year. Mr Sawyer declined to comment.	A chief constable and police crime commissioner are locked in a row over a £500,000 office move.
Yet in this election, it is way down the list of priorities for most political parties. Philip Hammond, himself a former defence secretary, has been reported as saying recently that "there are no votes in defence". He does not recognise the quote, but the sentiment is largely borne out by the opinion polls which show defence just scrapes into the top 10 of electorate concerns, way behind the economy, the NHS and immigration. UK military interventions in Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya may have also contributed to a sense of combat fatigue among the public and a reticence by politicians to focus on the subject. James de Waal, a senior fellow at independent think tank Chatham House, says in this campaign, politicians have been "on the defensive on defence". This election issue includes foreign policy and the role of UK’s defence forces at home and abroad. Policy guide: Where the parties stand To find out Labour and Conservative policies on the subject you will have to persevere to page 77 of both their manifestos. Even then they are pretty short on detail and do not really address the difficult decisions the next government is likely to face. So to help, here is a guide to some of the more sensitive issues being left out. Most analysts, and politicians, agree the world is becoming more dangerous and unstable, whether that is shown by thousands of migrants fleeing so-called failed states, the threat from Islamic extremism, or a more belligerent Russia. Yet at the same time, most European nations, including the UK, have been making significant cuts to their armed forces. The size of the UK's regular Army is being reduced from 102,000 to 82,000. You could fit that number in Wembley Stadium and still have seats to spare. The Royal Navy now has a fleet of just 19 warships, while the RAF has been left with eight - soon to be seven - front-line fast jet squadrons. There are some things the UK military can no longer do - so-called capability gaps. The UK has no Maritime Patrol Aircraft. It has to rely on its Nato allies to hunt for Russian submarines near or in its waters. At the start of the last parliament, David Cameron could boast that the UK was the fourth biggest spender on defence in the world. Now, according to the Stockholm International Research Institute, the UK has fallen to sixth place, behind the US, China, Russia, Saudi Arabia and France. A commitment to spend 2% of the nation's wealth, or GDP, on defence is conspicuous by its absence. Only two smaller parties - UKIP and the Democratic Unionist Party - say they would continue to meet that goal. But all the indications suggest the UK will soon fall below the Nato threshold. Malcolm Chalmers, of the defence think tank Royal United Services Institute, says on current projections, UK defence spending will fall to 1.7% by the end of the decade. If there are more cuts it could fall to 1.5%. He calculates that defence would require another £25bn over the next five years to stay above 2%. The military top brass know that is not going to happen. Their planning assumptions are based on flat spending plus an annual increase of 1% in the equipment budget. Spending 2% is not mandatory to Nato membership. Few states do, but it is totemic. The US will inevitably think less of a key ally that no longer lives up to that commitment, especially when David Cameron recently lectured others on the need to increase defence spending at the Nato summit in Wales. In US eyes, the UK's credibility will inevitably suffer if, as seems likely, it fails to meet the 2% target. It is more than likely that any future government will have to make more cuts in defence. The question is by how much? Over the lifetime of the last parliament, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) cut its budget by about 8%. With the Conservatives, Labour, and the Lib Dems promising to bring down the budget deficit, there will have to be more savings in public spending. None of these three parties say they would ring-fence or protect defence, like the NHS or overseas aid. The MoD has reason to be nervous - it has the second largest non-protected budget, after welfare, of £34bn a year. Another Conservative-led government plans to make savings of around £12bn a year. Shared across the board that could mean the MoD losing at least another  £2bn-£3bn of its annual budget. But Michael Clark, director of defence think tank Rusi, says most of the political parties appear to be backing away from further big cuts, in part because UKIP has made defence an issue during the campaign. The Conservatives also appear to have limited their options. They are promising to replace Trident, to increase the defence equipment budget by 1% a year, and to make no further cuts to the size of the regular army. Mr Clark says those commitments will make it hard to find "significant savings" in defence. But without raiding the MoD's coffers, he says, the Conservatives' entire fiscal plans would "go out of the window". Labour has been careful to avoid making similar commitments. Military chiefs, though, are still worried. Gen Sir Richard Shirreff, who was the second most senior military commander at Nato, says: " I fear it's almost certain that there will be more cuts." The Conservatives and UKIP are committed to renewing Britain's nuclear deterrent with a like-for-like replacement. That means building four new submarines at an estimated cost of at least £20bn. According to the MoD's own figures, about one quarter of committed defence equipment spending over the next decade will be on the successor submarines and deterrent systems. So it is an obvious area to look for savings. Labour say they would continue the round-the-clock patrols, known as Continuous At Sea Deterrent (CASD), but will look at whether that can be done with three rather than four submarines. The Liberal Democrats say they would retain a nuclear deterrent, but end CASD - what has been dubbed a "part-time deterrent". The SNP and the Greens would scrap it altogether. There is no political consensus. James de Waal, who worked in the MoD on the last Strategic Defence Review says: "Trident might be up for grabs." It is worth remembering the Tories went into the last election committed to renewing Trident, but as part of the coalition deal with the Liberal Democrats, postponed the decision. What is to prevent another review and another delay, especially if a party like the SNP holds the balance of power? Paul Ingram, who heads the British American Security Information Council, says the nuclear programme will have to be included in the next Strategic Defence Review, due after the election. Not least because he says the US will find it hard to stomach a key ally spending all that money on the nuclear programme, if it means contemplating further cuts to the UK's conventional forces. By the end of this decade, after a gap of 10 years, the UK will have two new operational aircraft carriers. The Queen Elizabeth and the Prince of Wales will be the largest warships ever built for the Royal Navy. They should be a symbol of power and of global ambition. But there is a danger that they will be more like the emperor's new clothes. On current manning levels, the Royal Navy will struggle to crew both carriers, even if as planned only one of them is operational at any given time. Plans to equip them with the new F-35 jet, have already had to be scaled down. There is space on board for 36 F-35s, but current plans are to sail with just 12. The current chief of the defence staff, Gen Sir Nicholas Houghton, has already warned of the dangers of a "hollow force" with "exquisite equipment" but not enough people. Politicians have long boasted that in military terms Britain can punch above its weight on the world stage. But it's becoming harder to live up to that rhetoric.	Defence of the realm is often cited as the first duty of government.
At one point in his final round of 67, Ramsay looked like he might take his challenge to the wire, closing to within a single shot of the eventual champion, Alex Noren, following a run of four straight birdies  in his opening six holes. He said he stood on the 10th tee believing for the first time in his life that he could win a title that he says would mean almost as much to him as a major championship. Not enough putts dropped on the back nine - he gave himself multiple opportunities - and he had to settle for the consolation prize of a slot in The Open. Ramsay asked about Andy Murray in the aftermath and called the now two-time Wimbledon champion an inspiration. "Watching Andy play at Wimbledon this week, watching Jamie play, those guys are huge inspirations for Scottish people," he said. "To win Wimbledon is a massive achievement and I think sometimes we take that for granted, we forget how good he is. "It's great watching him, because he's Scottish and because he's got that grit and fire. I love that attitude. For me, every week is about trying to be the best I can be. "When I'm 60, I want to sit in my chair watching the golf and be able to say that I won X number of tour titles and that I couldn't squeeze any more out of the talent I had. Talent is great, but if you don't have that hard work ethic, you're not to get anywhere." Ramsay has won three times on tour, the most recent of them being the Trophee Hassan in March last year. He's played in The Open five times, missing the cut on three occasions. His best finish was 58th at Muirfield in 2013. He was tied for 68th at St Andrews last year. His performance here rather came out of the blue. Ramsay finished sixth in China in May, but his form since then has been poor, his best finish a 43rd. His season had been a grind up until Castle Stuart. "I just loved it out there," he said. "I didn't come out with a tentative attitude, which has sometimes been my fault in the past. I hit some great shots. "I knew, standing on that 10th tee, that I could win the tournament and that's a great feeling. I just have to take that into the next year and see if I can get this title in the bag one of these years. "From a confidence point of view, I will think to myself that I had a chance to win a huge tournament. You're halfway there when you believe you can do it. I know I have a lot more in the tank." Castle Stuart didn't get the champion it wanted, with due credit to the excellent Noren, but it was a terrific host venue. The troubling aspect - and it's reflective of golf's serious problem - was the size of the crowd on each of the four days. The total attendance for Thursday-Sunday was 41,809. The final round brought the smallest number of fans - 8,733 - of the week. There was a Murray effect there for sure. But it's a much wider issue than that. Last year at Gullane, the Scottish brought in a total crowd of 63,000, which was, in turn, less than the 65,833 that attended the year before at Royal Aberdeen. The small numbers this time are partly on account of geography but also to do with golf's diminishing attraction as a spectator sport. None of that bothered Noren, of course. Nor Ramsay. If there was a competition to find the widest smile at Castle Stuart last night, the two of them would have been locked in a dead heat.	Richie Ramsay didn't win the Scottish Open at Castle Stuart, but he wore a contented smile none the less having played himself into the top-six and securing himself a place in The Open Championship at Royal Troon later this week.
The Oil and Gas Technology Centre will partly fund the work while also acting as a bridge between small tech firms and the big oil producers. The industry said research projects have recently been neglected. It said this happened after many production platforms were sold by the big oil majors to much smaller firms. Oil supply company Mistras has been developing technology more commonly used to enable expectant mothers to see their babies. The ultrasound scanners, complete with cold jelly, are being used to detect corrosion in pipes. The Dyce-based company hopes the technology centre will help them get their product to new customers. Managing director Tim Walsh said: "What we are hoping and expecting from the technology centre is that it will allow us as an organisation that has solutions to particular problems that we know exist to get a better connection with end users and clients and get more traction. "We want them to allow us to take them out into the field, give us the opportunity to demonstrate to potential clients that the technology works and that the technology can actually allow them to do what we want them to do." The Oil and Gas Technology centre will invest in small firms with solid ideas and help pair some of those developers with the offshore operators that need them. Chief executive Colette Cohen said: "We have much more operators in the north sea now, I think it's about 60 operators whereas back in the 80s it was about five or six, so it is a hugely different world. "Those smaller operators don't have a technology organisation. They're not big enough and they can't support that, it wouldn't be economic. "So this is a time when we can provide that service to them." The new centre will build on the existing work being carried out by Aberdeen's two universities. At Robert Gordon University they have a drilling-rig simulator where they train students and refresh the skills of those in the industry. They will now be able to incorporate new technologies into their models to see if they work effectively. Prof Phil Hassard said: "They'll be able to get the results back from that... they can be tested here and are more cost effective than trying to do it on a real rig." The centre's conception stems from the principles of Sir Ian Wood's report into maximising economic recovery in the North Sea. The oil tycoon was one of the invited guests at the official opening.	A new research and development facility has opened in Aberdeen to help breathe new life into the struggling North Sea oil industry.
The Tories won 37 of 64 seats to claim a majority and wipe out Labour's 22-seat majority from 2013. Labour picked up 24 seats this time around, the Liberal Democrats won three and UKIP finished with none. Towns where seats turned from red to blue included Swadlincote, Matlock, Glossop, Buxton, Ripley, Belper and Ilkeston. Turnout was 38%. Election 2017: Full results from across England Conservative leader Barry Lewis described the result as "brilliant". "We didn't think at this point in the electoral cycle we'd be taking control of Derbyshire County Council," he said. "We fought a really good campaign on local issues and I think that's really helped. We got our manifesto out early and really hit the doorsteps." This was Labour's last stand - its last county council to be defended in England. And its defences have proven to be weak. The Conservatives have won across the south and centre of the county - in places like Heanor, Ilkeston and Ripley. They've also taken seats off the Lib Dems. And it was a bad night too for UKIP - their share of the vote in Derbyshire collapsed.	The Conservatives have taken control of Derbyshire County Council with a massive swing from Labour.
Firefighters spent several days at the site in Duncan Street following the blaze on 2 March, which reduced train services and caused travel delays. The Environment Agency (EA) suspended Recovered Fuels Shipping Limited from accepting waste after the fire. The firm was "broadly compliant" with fire safety law, the fire service said. Recovered Fuels Shipping Limited, whose site was run by Asset and Land Group, could not be contacted for a comment. It has until 7 August to appeal the decision. Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service (GMFRS) visited the premises nine times in the last 12 months. Geoff Harris, GMFRS area manager, said: "The site operators, Asset and Land, have been broadly compliant with fire safety legislation throughout that time." The fire service raised concerns to the EA in February over the impact a fire could have on nearby residents, transport and the environment. "The EA were very interested in our concerns, which resulted in our fire safety officers conducting joint visits to the site with EA staff, the EA decided to take enforcement action against the site operators," Mr Harris said. An EA spokesman said: "After consideration of all the facts relating to the company and the site, the EA has now decided to revoke the environmental permit. "Subject to any appeal, the revocation takes effect on 7 August, which means after that date the company will no longer be able to operate from that site. The company is still required to remove all the waste." The cause of the fire remains undetermined.	A company which runs a paper recycling plant in Salford where a major fire broke out has had its environmental permit revoked.
Govia Thameslink (GTR), parent company of Southern rail, paid £2,233,000 in 2015-16, which it said was about 50% more that in 2014-15. The company went on to face further disruption this year, with months of strikes in a row over guards' roles and high sickness levels on Southern. Compensation figures for 2016-17 have not yet been released. Last December, consumer group Which? lodged a "super complaint" amid claims the system for obtaining compensation for delayed journeys was too complicated. The rail regulator, the Office of Rail and Road (ORR), also made a number of recommendations to the industry - such as raising awareness of what compensation was available and making claim forms easier to understand. Independent watchdog Transport Focus has found the proportion of people claiming compensation has nearly trebled over three years, from 12% in 2013 to 35% this year. The ORR's deputy director for consumers, Stephanie Tobyn, called for continued progress and said: "More needs to be done." Rail minister Paul Maynard said: "Passengers need to know that they will be compensated fairly. "We have been working with partners in the rail industry to ensure passengers are aware of their right to recompense for disruption and, at the same time, we are making the claim process simpler and swifter so that it is easier and more attractive to apply." Data released by the government and Network Rail also showed GTR received more than £22m from Network Rail in compensation for disruption, but GTR said those payments had gone to the government. The Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operators, said Network Rail's payments were "entirely separate" from those made to passengers. The net payment received by the rail company from Network Rail was £22,444,616.71.	A troubled rail firm paid over £2m in compensation last year for disruption to passengers, figures have shown.
The display in Block 27 places the former camp in the broader context of Nazi Germany's systematic attempt to wipe out Europe's Jewish population. It is being overseen by Israel's Yad Vashem Holocaust institute. Earlier in Warsaw, Mr Netanyahu accused Iran, one of Israel's strongest foes, of planning a new Holocaust. By Adam EastonBBC News, Warsaw The new permanent Shoah exhibition has replaced the dilapidated one that was installed in 1960s communist-era Poland. It is an impressive, powerful exhibition. Upon entering a darkened room a prayer can be heard. The next room displays a panorama of slides and video of pre-war Jewish life in Europe. One room is devoted to Nazi ideology, showing video of speeches by Hitler and Goebbels. A map points out the numerous Jewish extermination sites across Europe. One of the most moving displays highlights the 1.5 million Jewish children murdered by the Nazis. An art installation reproduces their pencil drawings made during the Holocaust on stark white walls. There is also a Book of Names, running to 58 volumes, which aims to list all the names of the six million Holocaust victims. Finally, there is a room for visitors to sit and reflect upon the horrors they have just seen. On Thursday, he was taken around the exhibition at the former camp before making a speech at the opening ceremony, Yad Vashem reported on its Twitter account. The original Jewish exhibition at Auschwitz dated back to the 1960s and had fallen into neglect, prompting the Israeli government to decide recently on a revamp. An estimated one million Jews, together with some 100,000 people of other ethnicities and backgrounds, died in Auschwitz and the adjacent Birkenau camp, in gas chambers or from starvation, disease and forced labour. The new display features: Mr Netanyahu used a visit to the Polish capital on Wednesday to warn that Iran was now a major threat to the Jews. Iranians are going to the polls on Friday to elect a new president, with the hard-line incumbent, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, not eligible for a third term. Mr Netanyahu said the Iranian election on Friday would "change nothing" in the Islamic republic's alleged quest for nuclear weapons. "This is a regime that is building nuclear weapons with the expressed purpose to annihilate Israel's six million Jews," he said. "We will not allow this to happen. We will never allow another Holocaust." Tehran denies seeking to acquire nuclear weapons. Iran is viewed as a threat in Israel because of its aggressive rhetoric, its support for militant groups in the region, its arsenal of long-range missiles and its nuclear work. However, critics of the Israeli prime minister have accused him of citing the Holocaust too frequently in the context of Iran. Aluf Benn, editor of liberal Israeli newspaper Haaretz, wrote in an editorial last week: "Shoah [Holocaust] warnings have taken over the political and military discourse."	Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has opened a Holocaust exhibition at the Auschwitz Nazi death camp site in southern Poland.
The city council says 500 self-service bikes will be located across the city from April 2017. A previous pilot scheme, which saw 70 bikes installed at 10 locations, ended in 2011. Ramesh Patel, Cabinet Member for Transport, Planning and Sustainability, said: "The new scheme intends to be far larger that the initial pilot scheme. "The bikes will be based at a number of easily accessed sites including hire stations at district centres, universities and other strategic locations close to existing public transport facilities." The council wants to secure a provider to supply, maintain and operate the scheme, which it says, will be financed through sponsorship income and at no cost to the taxpayer. 'Boris bikes' were launched in London in 2010, with bikes being hired from any docking station using debit or credit cards. They can later be returned to any empty docking point. The scheme has since been rolled out to a number of cities across the country.	Cardiff is to get a public bicycle hire scheme based on London's "Boris bikes".
Dear Alison I am compelled to write and seek review of an historic case of rape. Unusually, and contrary to current practice and the ACPO/CPS Guidance on the Investigation and Prosecution of Rape Cases, the investigation into the serious allegations in this case was dropped before the suspect was interviewed. The elements of lack of freedom and capacity to consent - which may even have triggered the "no consent" legal presumption - make the decision highly irregular. This is shocking in itself. It further troubles me that the senior police officer who dropped the case revealed to the victim he apparently took a series of worthless stereotypes and other irrelevant points into consideration. He did this after apparently consulting with an unnamed CPS official. Most of these stereotypes have been blown out of the water in recent months. Or so I thought. There has been a sea change in the climate surrounding rape, historic cases in particular. Why is it that the tide has not reached this case? I am driven to the unpalatable conclusion that the identity of the alleged perpetrator - Leon Brittan - may in some way have influenced treatment of the case.  I hope I am wrong. But in my view the case demands your personal attention and an immediate review by the CPS Area Head of Sexual Offences. As you know, I have been working with the Metropolitan police on a number of cases involving sexual crimes over the last 18 months. I have been the recipient of a considerable amount of information from victims directly, much of which I have passed on to the police. You will know that some of this information has already led to arrests. I anticipate that, under your leadership, more work will follow. I enclose a contemporaneous note written by victim _________ of a rather blunt conversation she had with DCI Settle concerning his decision to drop the case. I invite you to note, in particular, that he told the victim - who had been locked in a flat and tried to escape from the bathroom window: "There is no evidence he asked you for sex, forced you to have sex, or asked you to take off your clothes, which you did voluntarily" This was apparently considered to be a fatal deficiency. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the victim has not has this confirmed in writing as promised. I asked _______ to share her thoughts after her experience of reporting a crime. These are her words: "My feelings are that I have been brutally misled having been encouraged by the DPP statements to come forward with my historical case following the Savile affair. All the public pronouncements after Savile suggested that these investigations would be treated sensitively, non-judgmentally and in a victim-centric way. I have been interviewed twice in long, harrowing video sessions first by ______ Police, then MPS [Metropolitan Police Service]. I have been encouraged by the MPS to believe that my evidence is both credible and corroborated. I have repeatedly had to relive the most harrowing night of my life, long pushed to the back of my mind. Then, when I had the temerity to question a police decision I have been turned on by a senior police officer, apparently with the support of the CPS. I have been implicitly accused of making an allegation against someone because 'it is all about who he is'. I have been implicitly accused of being a slut because I sat on a bed. These are attitudes that women of my generation associate with the police and prosecution authorities of the sixties and seventies, not an enlightened and publicly accountable twenty- first century service. It was these attitudes that made me think I would get nowhere if I proceeded with the case when the rape happened. It seems nothing has changed". I have found myself appalled at the conduct of this investigation. I would like to believe that it is not typical of the CPS and Metropolitan police as a whole. However the case raises some very serious questions which are likely to remain unanswered without your attention. In the light of this, please could you confirm to me that: Everyone is complicit in the failures of the past. But we have an opportunity now to put matters right. Any attempt to perpetuate a CPS in which a victim's acquiescence in or inability to escape rape is a barrier to prosecution would fail, with grievous consequences, and would be wrong. There is a strong public interest in getting this right. I have every confidence that your leadership, and personal intervention in this case, will take the CPS in an altogether better direction.	Below is the full letter that deputy Labour leader Tom Watson sent to the director public prosecutions Alison Saunders in April 2014 urging her to look again at the Lord Brittan allegations.
The eighteen-year-old lost his lower legs and spent nearly a month in hospital after the accident. It happened during a race at Donington Park, days before his birthday. When he was recovering from his accident, Billy said he really wanted to race again, despite his injuries, Now the Formula 4 racer is back behind the wheel - trying out a car specially designed to make it easy for him to drive. The controls for the Fun Cup endurance racer are attached to the steering wheel instead of being the floor of the car, where they'd normally be. The new racing car came from a group called Team BRIT. They help disabled people and people with injuries that would making driving difficult, to compete in motorsport. It's designed to look like a Volkswagen Beetle, and Billy's been giving it a test drive at Brands Hatch in Kent. Billy says it's been really good just to get back behind the wheel, but he still wants to perfect his technique and get used to driving the new car. While Billy still has some training and therapy to get through, he says that's all going well, and he's hoping to get back out on the track properly soon. He says his ambition is now to compete in the Le Mans 24 Hours, along with Frenchman Frederic Sausset, who lost both his arms and legs through an illness. The teenager also wants to thank his fans, saying he's been overwhelmed by the help they've given him. He says: "People keep saying I'm the inspiration but I think all these people coming together to support someone who has gone through an accident like this, they're the true inspiration."	Teenage racing driver Billy Monger has returned to the racing track, almost three months after he was badly hurt in a crash.
Mrs Dewani, 28, died after the car she was travelling in with her husband, Shrien, 31, was hijacked in Cape Town. The vigils were held on 13 November in Bristol, London, Cape Town and also Sweden where she was born. South African authorities have applied to have Mr Dewani extradited over claims he was involved in her murder. He denies the charges. Taxi driver Zola Tongo from Bothasig, Cape Town, has been jailed for 18 years for murder, kidnapping, robbery with aggravating circumstances and perverting the course of justice after agreeing a plea bargain. Mr Dewani, from Bristol, faces charges of murder, conspiracy to commit murder, robbery with aggravating circumstances and obstructing the administration of justice. Mr Dewani's extradition was backed by Home Secretary Theresa May after a judge approved the move in August. An appeal has been lodged with the High Court. Mrs Dewani's uncle, Manoj Panchmatia, who helped organise the vigils, said it had been "a very difficult year for the family". "We are all looking for some form of closure," he added. Mr Panchmatia said the idea had come from users of Facebook who wanted to do "something special". He said the family had received hundreds of emails from people saying they planned to light a candle. The vigils, including one in Harrow, north London, where Mrs Dewani lived with relatives before getting married, were scheduled for 17:30 GMT. Two other men, Mziwamadoda Qwabe, 25, and Xolile Mngeni, 23, are also charged with murder, as well as kidnapping and robbery with aggravating circumstances and will go on trial at the Western Cape High Court next year. Mrs Dewani was shot after a cab the couple were travelling in was hijacked in the Gugulethu township. Mr Dewani was released unharmed but Mrs Dewani's body was later found in the abandoned car.	Candlelit vigils have been held a year on from the shooting of Anni Dewani during her honeymoon in South Africa.
Media playback is not supported on this device The British rivals meet in Group B at Euro 2016 on Thursday (14:00 BST). Last week, 26-year-old Bale said the Welsh had more passion and pride than England, who "big themselves up before they've done anything". "I've been in the game sufficiently long to know every opponent has got an opinion," said Hodgson. "The other day it was [Russia goalkeeper] Igor Akinfeev saying we were the worst seeded team and now it's Gareth Bale. "They can have those opinions but I don't have any doubts personally about our patriotism or desire and that's the important thing. "I would recommend anybody who does have any doubts about players in that respect to watch the game [against Russia] and come to me afterwards and show me where they've seen that lack of passion and lack of patriotism because I certainly didn't see it. "We know who we are, we know what we are. We don't have any doubts about ourselves in that respect." Media playback is not supported on this device England started their campaign with a 1-1 draw against Russia, while Wales beat Slovakia 2-1 in the their first game in a major tournament for 58 years. It was Bale who scored Wales' opener in Bordeaux, and England captain Wayne Rooney is aware of the threat posed by the Real Madrid forward. "I think he is a fantastic player, probably in the top five players in the world," said the Manchester United skipper. "He is the biggest threat for Wales, but I don't think we will go out and man-mark him. "I think we have to go out and play our game. They will have a lot to think about our team, too. I'm sure it will be a fascinating game." England were leading 1-0 against Russia thanks to an Eric Dier free-kick but they had to settle for a 1-1 draw after conceding an injury-time equaliser. The result means they have failed to win any of their last five matches at major tournaments, but striker Harry Kane insisted England fans should remain positive. "We have got great players, we ain't no mugs," said the Tottenham forward. "We are more than confident. We are not going to let this affect us. "On another day it could have been three or four nil. We limited Russia to very few chances and we had plenty. We have got to learn from it, take the positives and prepare for Thursday."	Manager Roy Hodgson says he does not doubt England's "patriotism or desire", in the wake of comments made by Wales striker Gareth Bale.
In 2007, the Icelandic economy appeared healthy. Its real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was 35% higher than it was in 2002, unemployment was 2.3% and government debt was a modest 27% of GDP. However, the assets of its three largest banks had grown to over nine times GDP, a size that made it impossible for the Icelandic central bank to act as an effective lender of last resort. Thus, regardless of the quality of the banks' assets, the predictable consequence was a bank run and the subsequent collapse of the Icelandic banking system. Following the demise of its banks, Iceland imposed capital controls to prevent massive outflows and a plunge in the value of its currency. Recapitalisation of its banking system and other crisis-related expenses caused government debt to rise to 95% of GDP by 2011. However, a successful International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme cushioned the impact: real GDP fell by a less-than-expected 6.6% in 2009 and 4.1% in 2010, before returning to growth. Icelandic authorities protected the holders of domestic deposits, who enjoyed uninterrupted access to their accounts; the UK and Dutch governments stepped in to protect deposit holders in UK and Dutch branches of Icelandic banks. In 2013, the European Free Trade Association (Efta) court ruled that Iceland did not breach its obligations, either by treating domestic deposits differently or by not accepting legal obligation for foreign branch deposits. Today, Iceland faces the difficult challenge of removing its capital controls in an orderly fashion but the IMF expects real GDP growth of 4.1% in 2015. In 2008, the Cypriot economy was more like that of an emerging market nation than a modern European one, but the country was enjoying an economic boom. Cypriot real GDP had grown by 27% between 2002 and 2008. The growth, however, had been fuelled by inflows of foreign bank deposits and foreign loans to banks. As a result, the assets of commercial banks with Cypriot parents expanded to over five times' Cypriot GDP. Unlike the Icelandic banks, the Cypriot banks had a credible lender of last resort: their central bank was a member of the Eurosystem. Unfortunately, they were heavily exposed to Greece. Cypriot banks were hit hard by the restructuring of Greek sovereign debt in 2012. In March 2013, the Cypriot authorities were in a desperate situation. Either they had to make a sizable contribution to a European Stability Mechanism/IMF rescue package or the emergency loans Cypriot banks had been receiving through its central bank would be cut off. Without the rescue package, saving the Cypriot banking system would be likely to require exiting from the euro area, adopting a new currency and recapitalising the banks by printing money. This would cause the value of the new currency to plummet, taking with it the real value of Cypriot pensions, wages and bank accounts. To avoid catastrophe, the Cypriot authorities looked to the one source of readily available funds: Cypriot bank deposits. Initially they planned to impose a levy on all deposits but ultimately insured depositors were spared. To stem a run, capital controls were imposed. Banks were closed for two weeks and when they were reopened there was a limit on daily withdrawals. Real GDP fell by 2.4% in 2012, 5.4% in 2013 and 2.3% in 2014. Unemployment rose to 16.2% in 2014 and government debt has climbed to 107% of GDP. Currently, the outlook for Cyprus is guarded. The country finally returned to economic growth this year and the capital controls were removed entirely in April. However, further economic reform is necessary to ensure sustainable growth. Greece currently faces a choice similar to the one faced by Cyprus in 2013. Its banking system depends for its survival on emergency lending controlled by the ECB. Bank runs have forced the imposition of capital controls, temporary bank closures and limits on deposit withdrawals. The consequences of leaving the Eurosystem are likely to be as dire for Greece as they would have been for Cyprus. Reaching an accommodation with its creditors is the preferred outcome. Real GDP has fallen by almost 30% in Greece since 2007, partly because of severe fiscal austerity. Unemployment was 26% in 2014 and there has been an exodus of skilled labour. As with Cyprus, and unlike with Iceland, any lasting recovery will require significant economic and fiscal reform. Greece ranks 61st in the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business Index, edging out Russia and Cyprus (at 64) but behind Tunisia; Iceland is 12th. Government debt was already a massive 113% of annual GDP in 2008 and now stands at 180%. Capital controls were necessary in Iceland and Cyprus, and in Greece today, but they come at a cost. Many view them as an assault on civil liberties; others see them as a chance to profit. Even in Iceland, a remote island nation, evasion and avoidance appear to have been widespread. Some say they promote disrespect for the law and the belief that once again the wealthy, sophisticated and corrupt are benefiting at the expense of the rest of society. Anne Sibert is a professor of Economics at Birkbeck, University of London, a fellow of the Centre for Economic Policy Research. She is a former member of the Monetary Policy Committee of the Central Bank of Iceland.	As people across cash-strapped Greece wait to vote in a referendum on Sunday on whether to accept proposals made by creditors, what can be learned by examining similar economic crises in Iceland and Cyprus?
Several decades later it had become, in the words of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, India's "greatest internal security challenge". Maoists are also known as "Naxalites" because of the violent left-wing uprising in 1967, which began in the West Bengal village of Naxalbari. Although this was eventually quashed by police, over the years India's Maoists have regrouped and asserted control over vast swathes of land in central and eastern India, establishing a so-called "red corridor". This spans the states of Jharkand, West Bengal, Orissa, Bihar, Chhattisgarh and Andhra Pradesh and also reaches into Uttar Pradesh, and Karnataka. The Maoists and affiliated groups are active in more than a third of India's 600-odd districts, the authorities say. And more than 6,000 people have died in the rebels' long fight for communist rule in these states. The Maoists' military leader is Koteshwar Rao, otherwise known as Kishenji. He reportedly suffered temporary paralysis in June 2010 when a police bullet hit him in the knee. Normally a regular communicator with the press, Kishenji was little heard of until January 2011 when he issued a statement saying he expected India to succumb to a Maoist revolution by 2025. Latest estimates suggest he commandes at least 20,000 armed fighters. They are said to get most of their weapons by raiding police bases. Analysts say the longevity of the Maoist rebellion is partly due to the local support they receive. The rebels say they are fighting for the rights of indigenous tribespeople and the rural poor who they say have been neglected by governments for decades. Maoists claim to represent local concerns over land ownership and equitable distribution of resources. Ultimately they say they want to establish a "communist society" by overthrowing India's "semi-colonial, semi-feudal" form of rule through armed struggle. The BBC's Subir Bhaumik in Calcutta says that while there is little prospect of them making any headway in urban areas - or indeed non-jungle rural areas - the rebels remain a force to be reckoned with in remote areas where the security forces are thin on the ground. Our correspondent says the key question now is whether to deploy the army against the rebels in the same way it has been used in Indian-administered Kashmir and some north-eastern states. Such a move would be highly controversial, because it would inevitably been seen by some critics as evidence that the rebels are making headway in what is seen by some as "mainland India". Over the years the Maoists have managed to launch a series of damaging attacks on Indian security forces. In 2009, rebels gained virtual control of Lalgarh district in West Bengal barely 250km (155 miles) from the state capital, Calcutta. For many months, rebels, supported by local villagers, held hundreds of paramilitary forces at bay. The Maoists declared it to be India's first "liberated zone" but Indian security forces finally overwhelmed the rebels. April 2010 saw rebels ambush paramilitary troops in the dense jungles of central Chhattisgarh state, killing at least 76 soldiers. Correspondents say it was the worst-ever Maoist attack on Indian security forces. In 2007, also in Chhattisgarh, Maoist rebels killed 55 policemen in an attack on a remote police outpost. Almost every week, Maoist rebels are blamed for minor skirmishes and incidents across India's north-east - common tactics include blowing up railway tracks and attacking police stations. In 2010, the Maoists faced India's biggest ever anti-Maoist offensive. Nearly 50,000 federal paramilitary troops and tens of thousands of policemen took part in the operation across several states. While the rebels were pushed back deep into their jungle strongholds, they have continued to carry out hit-and-run attacks and numerous high-profile kidnappings. India's government in turn has pledged to crack down even harder unless rebels renounce violence and enter peace talks. At the same time there have been differences not just within the central government over how to tackle the rebellion, but also between Delhi and various Indian states affected by the insurgency. Experts say that disagreements over whether to deploy the army against the rebels is a manifestation of these tensions. On one issue however the analysts remain united - the chances of any kind of meaningful dialogue with the rebels in the foreseeable future are slim.	India's bloody Maoist insurgency began in the remote forests of the state of West Bengal in the late 1960s.
A report to a UN ocean conference in New York points out that more than 60% of the ocean has no rules because it’s outside national jurisdiction. It says the open ocean is at risk from climate change, over-fishing, deep sea mining, farm pollution and plastics. The authors say one area – the Bay of Bengal - is at a tipping point which could impact on global fish stocks. The report was commissioned to inform delegates preparing a UN resolution on governance of the open ocean. Representatives in New York are preparing a text that could cover everything from establishing marine protected areas to distributing the benefits of valuable biotech products generated from the seas. One of the report’s authors, Prof Alex Rogers from Oxford University, told BBC News: “This is very, very important. A lot of states are looking towards developing industrial activities in the ocean – fishing, deep-sea mining, renewable energy… even aquaculture offshore. “It’s really vital that we come to some international agreement on how to protect or manage biodiversity on high seas in the face of all these pressures.” The UN is focusing discussion on three areas: Together they are categorised under a new UN acronym – BBNJ. That’s Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction. Prof Rogers’ report is a review of new science over the past five years. He says he realises how little is known about some essential ocean processes, and mentions the Bay of Bengal issue as a source of great concern. The issue there is nitrogen, which performs an positive role in fertilising algae at the bottom of the food chain, but can also have negative effects if there’s too much of it in the water. At the moment, nitrogen fertilisers in the Bay of Bengal are running off farmland and over-fertilising algae. This in turn encourages bacteria, which capture oxygen. Slowly marine life in the area disappears. But the Bay of Bengal is now on the verge of going one destructive stage more. The report says if oxygen levels decrease further as a result of run-off or increasing water temperatures, then the entire ocean basin may flip to a no-oxygen status. In one of Nature’s paradoxes, this would then lead to different bacteria actually removing nitrogen from the water. Prof Rogers said the de-nitrified water would then be carried away by ocean currents, and greatly reduce ocean productivity elsewhere. Dr Greg Cowie from Edinburgh University told BBC News that the growing dead zone in the Bay of Bengal would have enormous local consequences. “You have to remember there are 400 million people living round the rim of the bay. There are half a million fishers. If the situation gets much worse we are going to get a huge human problem,” he said. Christiana Figueres, a former chief climate negotiator, is joining a push at the UN for a formal treaty process to safeguard the high seas. She says a healthy ocean can buffer the planet against changing climate by continuing to soak up CO2 emissions from the air. She told BBC News: “As with the atmosphere, the high seas belong to everyone. But they have also been damaged by all.  What could be seen by some as the tragedy of the commons can also be recognized now as an opportunity for a radical recovery of the commons.” The deep sea is the biggest store of CO2 emissions from humanity, as ocean circulation pulls in carbon from the atmosphere and tiny marine plants called phytoplankton soak it up. These are then eaten by creatures called zooplankton and their bodies sink to the ocean floor. The Oxford scientists say as the seas warm, the abundance of phytoplankton may fall. This will impact the whole food web, including fish stocks and the rate at which CO2 is locked up on the sea bed. They also say raised sea temperatures have resulted in the rise of Vibriobacteria, which live in warm seas and have been associated with a global increase in illnesses like cholera, gastroenteritis, wound infections and septicaemia. They echo the many recent warnings about increasing quantities of plastics large and small, although they say the effects are as yet poorly understood. Their report says the effects of ocean mining must be carefully monitored, too. Meanwhile, a third UK pub group has announced it will stop using plastic straws is a small contribution to reducing ocean plastic waste. The Liberation Group, based in the West Country and the Channel Islands, is supporting Jersey’s Straws Suck campaign. It follows a BBC News story highlighting a plea for plastic straws to be taxed because  so many of them get blown into water courses.

Jean Say killed his son and daughter two years ago. The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said Southwark Sapphire unit in south London "encouraged" victims to withdraw allegations to boost detection rates. The Metropolitan Police said substantial changes had been made. The rape allegation against Say was dismissed by a detective sergeant based at Southwark, who said the circumstances did not constitute rape because the woman "consented". The report by the IPCC said: "There is no doubt from the evidence that the woman made an allegation of rape at Walworth police station which should have been believed and thoroughly investigated." The IPCC said the Southwark Sapphire squad's approach of "failing to believe victims" was "wholly inappropriate".  It also said it was "under-performing and over-stretched". Deputy chairwoman of the IPCC Deborah Glass said: "There's no doubt this was an incredibly serious, shocking incident. "We know with all the cases that we've dealt with that the consequences of not dealing with allegations of rape can be extremely serious. "This is yet another tragic illustration of that." Say, 62, a retired concierge, attacked his daughter Regina, eight, and son Rolls, 10, in their beds at his home in Southwark in 2011, while they were on a weekend access visit. The Old Bailey heard he killed them to spite his wife who had left him. He was given a 30-year minimum term. The case sparked a wider investigation into the work of the unit between July 2008 and September 2009, the results of which have now been published. The IPCC has carried out five previous inquiries into Southwark Sapphire command and it is the police watchdog's ninth investigation into the Met's response to victims of sexual violence. By Danny ShawHome affairs correspondent, BBC News No one will ever know if Jean Say's children would be alive today if he'd been arrested and investigated for rape three years before he stabbed them to death. But if police hadn't "no-crimed" the rape allegation, the chances are Say's threatening and violent behaviour would have been uncovered. The Say case is the most egregious example of the dysfunctional approach to rape investigations at the Southwark Sapphire unit; what we don't know is how many other sexual assault victims were wrongly disbelieved and the impact that's had on them and on others. Although Scotland Yard says the Sapphire units have changed for the better, the practice of no-crimeing is still a problem across other forces: in England and Wales reported rapes are three times as likely to be written off as other incidents are. Home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said three Metropolitan officers who had been facing possible dismissal over a previous bungled investigation into the serial sex offender Kirk Reid, were still with the force. Two of them, a superintendent and a detective inspector, have been promoted. A detective sergeant is facing disciplinary proceedings for alleged gross misconduct in connection with the allegations. In another case, Det Con Ryan Coleman-Farrow, who was based in Southwark, was jailed for 16 months in October last year for failing to investigate rape and sexual assault claims. A second officer, based in Islington, north London, is still under criminal investigation. In total 19 officers from across London have been disciplined, including three who have been sacked. A Met Police spokesman said: "We have for some time acknowledged that previous investigation of rape and serious sexual assault in the MPS was below standard. "The activities identified in this report came during that era and highlight specific issues within Southwark which resulted in unacceptable actions by local officers. "It is as a result of such failings that we have made substantial changes to the investigation of rape and serious sexual assault, both in terms of structure and revised working practices."	A police officer at a sex crime unit encouraged a woman to drop a rape claim against a man who went on to murder his two children, a report has said.
Mitch Rose had put the Stags ahead just four minutes into the second half. Matt Green wriggled between Easah Suliman and Dan Parslow on the left before setting up Rose from 12 yards with a square pass that he stroked home low first time. That looked likely to be enough as home goalkeeper Scott Shearer had little to do until he picked O'Shaughnessy's stunner out of his net. A tight first half saw the game fail to catch alight. But the Robins wasted the best chance after 22 minutes as Billy Waters crossed from the right and picked out an unmarked Harry Pell six yards from goal. However, Shearer saved his defenders' blushes with a great save low to his left. Green almost broke through in the 32nd minute only to see Russell Griffiths get down well to his right to turn away his low drive from 20 yards after winning a tussle for the ball.

The supporters claimed the London Legacy Development Corporation (LLDC) would subsidise rent, which it denied. The group made up of trusts from clubs including Arsenal said it was "disappointed" by the decision but had expected it. The government said the deal had been "scrutinised" and "upheld". The LLDC, which owns the stadium, said West Ham contributed £15m to the £272m conversion of the stadium and the development corporation would also pay for "facilities and services" such as pitch maintenance and for stewarding on match days, which can cost £2.5m annually. It is also understood the club will pay up to £2.5m a year in rent, although the LLDC said it would never reveal that information. In comparison, Manchester City, who moved into the former Commonwealth Games stadium, pay overheads on top of £4m rent. The coalition of supporters, made up of trusts from clubs including Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur, started an online petition which had gained more than 24,000 signatures in favour of a public inquiry. Mat Roper said the group remained concerned they were expected to see it as a "fabulous deal for the taxpayer" when they had not seen any figures to support the claim and one document they requested had been "completely redacted". He said: "We're no nearer the truth of what we think is in the rental agreement....until we know that then we're going to continue. "Whether it happens to be continuing with that petition, a new petition or... a new FOI request, it's certainly not dead in the water." The group said they remained concerned the deal would give the Hammers a competitive advantage. But the Department for Culture, Media and Sport said: "West Ham United has a concession at the stadium and their contributions reflect that status. "The contract, awarded after an open public competition, has been widely scrutinised and tested in court. "The stadium remains in public ownership and the profits from its multiple uses will flow to the taxpayer." While West Ham will host all of their home matches at the stadium, British Athletics will take control of the arena for one month every summer.	The government has rejected a request from a group of football supporters to investigate the rental of the Olympic Stadium to West Ham United.
Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the US would consider working with Russia in some areas but would stand up for its own interests. Meanwhile, US Defence Secretary James Mattis said Washington was not ready to collaborate militarily with Moscow. US President Donald Trump has called for improved ties with Moscow. But the new administration's diplomatic initiative comes as questions are raised about the Trump team's dealings with Russia dating back to last year's election campaign. US intelligence services have concluded that Moscow hacked into emails of President Donald Trump's Democratic opponents during the election. Rex Tillerson may be on a steep learning curve in the transition from oil executive to top diplomat. But the State Department press corps is also adjusting. We'd become accustomed to the garrulous John Kerry, now we have his opposite: The Quiet Man. So far Mr Tillerson has spared only a few words for us, a "Good Morning, y'all" as we boarded the plane in Washington. And he diligently refused to respond to questions shouted out during brief moments of press access at the beginning of his meetings in Bonn, Germany. So we gleaned what we could: he chatted about his flight with the Saudi foreign minister and about jetlag with the Turkish foreign minister. Boris Johnson, the British Foreign Secretary, made him laugh with a joke about the Commonwealth. "Good try," Mr Johnson muttered as we lobbed another question, prompting more laughter but no answer. We were heartened when Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov made opening remarks, and perplexed when we were ushered out just as Mr Tillerson began to respond. He did give us a 43-second statement on Russia afterwards. And eventually a few spontaneous words as the questions continued. All in a hard day's work And three of Mr Trump's aides have been forced out over allegations about their links with Russia, including National Security Adviser Mike Flynn earlier this week. Mr Tillerson met Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on the sidelines of a G20 meeting in Germany as part of his first foreign trip in his new job. He said the US was willing to co-operate with Russia if Moscow lived up to its commitments. "As I made clear at my Senate confirmation hearing, the United States will consider working with Russia when we can find areas of practical co-operation that will benefit the American people," he said. "Where we do not see eye to eye, the United States will stand up for the interests and values of America and her allies. The secretary of state added that he expected Russia to honour its commitment to the Minsk agreements aimed at ending the conflict in Ukraine, and to work to stabilise the region. Russia's role in backing separatists in the east of the country has soured relations with the West since the conflict began in 2014. Mr Lavrov said the two sides had agreed to co-operate in areas where their interests coincided, particularly in the fight against terrorism, over Syria and in other countries in the Middle East where "terrorism has put down roots". However, he said that they did not discuss US sanctions against Russia, first imposed when Moscow annexed Crimea from Ukraine nearly three years ago. Mr Tillerson, who as ExxonMobil CEO was perceived to be close to the Russian leadership, told his nomination hearing in the Senate that he would consider reviewing the sanctions. Mr Tillerson also met the UK's Boris Johnson and other foreign ministers from the G20, made up of developed economies and emerging nations including China, India, Indonesia, Mexico, South Africa and Brazil. At a Nato meeting in Brussels, Gen Mattis rejected calls by Russian Defence Minister Sergey Shoigu to "restore co-operation with the Pentagon". "We are not in a position right now to collaborate on a military level, but our political leaders will engage and try to find common ground or a way forward," he told reporters. The defence secretary said that Russia had to abide by international law, adding that there was "little doubt" that Moscow had interfered or attempted to interfere in several Western elections.	Senior US officials have been setting out their position on Russia, in some of the new administration's first diplomatic moves.
Fleetwood, who won at January's Abu Dhabi Championship, shot a superb nine-under 63 to make up eight shots on Austrian Wiesberger in China. But the 26-year-old drove into trouble on the extra hole and Wiesberger holed out from five feet for the win. England's Ross Fisher finished joint third after a bogey on the 18th. Fisher had seemed set to join Fleetwood and Wiesberger in the shoot-out but his error on the last left him tied with France's Gregor Bourdy on 15 under. English duo Jordan Smith and Matthew Southgate were the next highest-placed Britons, finishing another four shots back in joint 14th.	England's Tommy Fleetwood was denied a second 2017 European Tour title after losing a play-off to Bernd Wiesberger at the Shenzhen International.
The aid package, worth 500m euros (£365m), was announced at a meeting of EU farm ministers in Brussels. It is understood the bulk of the money will be used to support the dairy sector in the various member countries. But there will be no increase in the milk intervention price, a key demand of Northern Ireland's dairy industry. It is the price at which Europe buys milk and milk powders to shore up the market and currently stands at about 16 to 17p. The commission said raising the price was not the "appropriate policy" and would not solve the current market problem. It added that it would create an "artificial outlet" for EU dairy products, pushing market prices further down. The commission's aid package is intended to help farmers' cash flow problems and stabilise agricultural markets. However, DUP MEP Diane Dodds said it "falls well short" of what is needed. She called on EU Agriculture Commissioner Phil Hogan to rethink and do more, especially on the milk intervention price. Agriculture Minister Michelle O'Neill said:  "We have thousands of farmers on the streets of Brussels here today waiting for answers and waiting for a glimmer of hope in terms of what support they're going to achieve. "That information still isn't clear at this minute in time." During the talks, thousands of European farmers held protests near the EU headquarters over falling farm produce prices and many blocked streets with tractors. Representatives of Northern Ireland's farming industry were among those attending the demonstrations, 23 of them from the UFU. In the meeting, the commission said it would give member states the flexibility to advance up to 70% of direct subsidy payments to farmers and 85% of rural development payments from 16 October. They are normally paid in December. The commission said it would allow for flexibility about the checks normally done before payment. However, the UFU questioned whether, given the complexity of checks under the new Common Agricultural Policy payment system, farmers would get their money any earlier. The aid package includes new private storage schemes for dairy protein products and pigmeat; an attempt to remove trade barriers in non-EU countries and more missions to non-EU countries in an attempt to open new markets. Farmers have been under pressure for some time, due in part to a Russian ban on EU food imposed in response to EU sanctions over Ukraine. A slowdown in the Chinese economy and the shrinking of markets in some oil producing countries has also had an impact. Northern Ireland's farmers have the complication of a weak euro, making their exports to the Eurozone more expensive. In the dairy sector, 85% of milk produced in Northern Ireland is destined for the export market. Latest figures show that in July, farmers in Northern Ireland got 18.87p a litre for milk - about 10p a litre below production cost.	The Ulster Farmers' Union (UFU) has said it is "disappointed" by the aid package for European farmers announced by the European Commission.
Previously, trainee doctors had to wait up to four years to experience the consultation room. GP Live was developed by Aberdeen University and uses streaming software to enter the consultation room. Researchers hope it will encourage more students to join general practice and help ease a recruitment crisis. The software will stream consultations just moments after they happen in an effort to give students a flavour of life as a GP. The system utilises one of the University's Digitally Enhanced Learning Spaces (DELS), where students can engage in interactive learning with the aid of 55-inch display screens and state-of-the-art web conference tools. It was developed by Dr John McKeown, a senior clinical lecturer and GP at Cults Medical Group in Aberdeen. He said: "The biggest appeal for students is that they are seeing consultations that are almost live, and this adds a sense of immediacy that appeals to students who have grown up in an era where digitisation has made learning far more interactive. "We aim to make the sessions as engaging as possible by discussing the GP's approach while the consultation takes place - for example how they communicate, the direction that they take the consultation, and of course their recommended course of action." Dr McKeown said that one of the main benefits of the system was that students and lecturers would be able to discuss consultations that have taken place at a variety of practices, where the issues could be very different. He added: "This means that students get a real insight into the challenges facing GPs who might operate in less affluent areas, or in remote rural locations. "The system also allows us to work through a number of different consultations in succession, which very much mimics a typical morning for a GP. "This allows us to see the range of skills - interpersonal, diagnostic and otherwise - that they bring to a normal working day." Dr McKeown said that by the time current first year students graduated there would be a pressing need for new GPs in Scotland.	A new project has been developed to allow first-year medical student in Scotland to watch GP consultation for the first time.
Media playback is not supported on this device Key football officials met in Doha to discuss a number of options following fears a summer event would endanger the health of players and fans. Summer temperatures in Qatar can exceed 40C while those in November and December drop to around 25C. Tuesday's recommendation is expected to be ratified by Fifa's executive committee in Zurich on 19 and 20 March. Taskforce chief Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim Al-Khalifa also recommended that the 2022 tournament should be shortened by a few days. There has already been speculation that the tournament could start on 26 November and end on 23 December. However, Fifa has already said there are no plans to reduce the size of the tournament from 32 teams or 64 matches. The other dates under consideration were May and January-February. Fifa said a number of options had been discussed but felt that November-December was the best one because: Media playback is not supported on this device Fifa general secretary Jerome Valcke said there were "pros and cons" for all options but said the "one solution" was November and December. Sheikh Salman added: "We are very pleased that, after careful consideration of the various opinions and detailed discussions with all stakeholders, we have identified what we believe to be the best solution for the 2018-2024 international match calendar and football in general." Fifa vice-president Jim Boyce said moving the World Cup to the winter was "common sense" but that a final on 23 December would be too close to Christmas and Britain's traditional festive matches. "That's the only reservation I would have and I would like it a week earlier," said Boyce. "But I want to wait until the Fifa executive committee meeting to hear all the details about the dates." Football Association chairman Greg Dyke said he would do all it could to protect the traditional festive period for club matches. That stance was echoed by Richard Scudamore, chief executive of the English Premier League. "We've got to make sure we keep the Christmas and New year programme intact," he said. Not so much a shock, more "the day many in football had feared", according to BBC sports editor Dan Roan. "Despite rampant opposition, Fifa says this unprecedented break with tradition is in the interests of players and fans," he said. "But the ramifications are considerable, causing havoc for fixture calendars in an estimated 50 countries. "Here in Qatar, this feels like the moment when the build-up towards 2022 can really begin and many will welcome Fifa asserting their power over the top clubs in the interests of a first World Cup in the Middle East. "It also compounds the controversy that surrounded a host nation dogged by allegations of corruption and the abuse of migrant workers. The rifts that already divide the sport today feel wider than ever." BBC Radio 5 live's sports news correspondent Richard Conway said Europe's leading leagues and clubs would be disappointed after losing "this argument" but indicated the row over dates would rumble on. Richard Scudamore, chief executive of the English Premier League, indicated the matter was far from settled. "Clearly there is still time within the process to consider our position further, but first we will consult with our clubs, other stakeholders in English football and other leagues before deciding on what, if any, further action might be appropriate or worthwhile," he said. Dan Roan added: "The debate surrounding the timing of the 2022 World Cup set the world's richest leagues on a collision course with Fifa. Europe's clubs will now seek compensation for the disruption caused." Fifa vice-president Jim Boyce said a tournament in November and December would "cause a lot of disruption" but added: "It is eight years away and people should have enough time to make it work." However, Peter Coates, chairman of English Premier League side Stoke City, described the situation as a "disaster". He told BBC Radio 5 live: "The only saving grace is that we don't have to think about it for a long time. It couldn't be more disruptive." Greg Dyke said the best option would be to move the World Cup from Qatar but that November-December was "the best of the bad options". English football's Premier League strongly opposed a winter tournament given the disruption it would cause to the title run-in and the hole it would create in the schedules of its broadcast partners. A World Cup in November and December also affects the Football League, the FA Cup and League Cup. League and cup competitions in Scotland may also face disruption, regardless of whether the national team qualifies for the tournament with players being called up for other international teams. Domestic leagues in Wales and Northern Ireland are less likely to be affected with the vast majority of players non-internationals. Many of Europe's top leagues wanted an April-May solution to minimise disruption to their domestic programmes, not to mention the impact on the Champions League and Europa League. According to English Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore, European leagues and clubs will "suffer the most". Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, chairman of the European Club Association, added that European clubs and leagues cannot be expected to bear the costs for any rescheduling. "We expect the clubs to be compensated for the damage that a final decision would cause," said the German. And Frederic Thiriez, president of the French football league and the European Professional Football Leagues, described it as "probably the most terrible decision" for domestic competitions. Asked about a potential boycott from European leagues, Thiriez said: "I don't want to threaten or say we will do this or that. Let's wait for the final decision on 19 March. Then we will see what we'll do. Everybody's trying to find a solution. I'm trying to defend the interests of the leagues in Europe. "It is the national leagues in Europe who guarantee the life of football in Europe. It's not the World Cup, neither the Champions League. It is the domestic championships. This is the heart of football." However, Savo Milosevic, vice-president of the Serbian Football Association, said his country could benefit. "Switching it to November and December is a good decision in my opinion and one that would also play into Serbia's hands if we qualify because it would practically coincide with our winter break," he said. European governing body Uefa also backed the taskforce, insisting it "sees no major issues in rescheduling its competitions". African officials agree with the taskforce, even though they will almost certainly have to move the 2023 African Cup of Nations from its January-February slot. Confederation of African Football's director of communications Junior Binyam said it was backing the proposal "100%". Concacaf, the confederation responsible for football in North America, Central America and the Caribbean said it "fully supports" the recommendations. The US Major League Soccer season will be unaffected given it runs from March until October. It's likely to be a similar tale with the Asian Football Confederation, given Sheikh Salman is president of that particular body. The Football Supporters' Federation questioned Sheikh Salman's claim to have had "detailed discussions with all stakeholders", saying the process would "bring renewed focus on to Fifa's governance and decision-making". It said: "Once again this is a top-down decision from Fifa that has alienated both fans and clubs. "The FSF is affiliated to Football Supporters Europe and they weren't consulted, despite representing millions of fans across the continent." Media playback is not supported on this device Average temperatures in November are around 29C, dropping to around 25C by mid-December, slightly cooler than the 35C averages in May. In June and July, those numbers increase significantly, regularly exceeding 40C. BBC Weather's Nick Miller said it is not just the heat that is a concern but the humidity, too: "Together, they put a lot of pressure on the body, particularly with any physical activity," Organisers planned to use air-cooling technology they claim lowers temperatures within grounds to about 23C.	The 2022 World Cup in Qatar should take place in November and December, a Fifa taskforce has recommended.
Kevin McGuigan Sr was shot dead at his home at Comber Court in the Short Strand on Wednesday. Police believe two men shot him several times in the head and chest at point blank range before running off. The BBC understands the 53-year-old was one of a number of suspects in the murder of Gerard 'Jock' Davison in May. Sinn Féin has denied speculation that Provisional IRA may have been involved in his murder. The DUP said there will be "repercussions" if that is the case. Mr McGuigan, a father-of-nine, was taken to the Royal Victoria Hospital but died a short time later. BBC Northern Ireland home affairs correspondent Vincent Kearney said Mr McGuigan was killed by two masked men using semi-automatic weapons in a "professional, execution-style killing". Appealing for information, the officer leading the murder investigation said the gunmen were on foot and wearing dark clothing with their faces covered. "We need to hear from anyone who has information about the events of last night, about the movements of the gunmen both leading up to and immediately after the shooting," said Det Ch Insp John McVea. Mr McGuigan had been questioned by police after the murder of Jock Davison in the Markets area of Belfast three months ago. Mr Davison, 47, was a former IRA commander and a former friend of Mr McGuigan. The IRA pair were also founding members of the paramilitary group Direct Action Against Drugs (DAAD), which killed more than a dozen alleged drug dealers. They were later involved in a feud, and Mr McGuigan was shot several times in a so-called punishment attack. It was claimed that Mr Davison gave the order for that attack on his former friend. Det Ch Insp McVea said police were "aware of speculation around a possible motive" for the murder of Mr McGuigan. The detective said that in the investigation into the murder of Mr Davison, Mr McGuigan was questioned "as a potential witness, not a suspect", and this was still the police's position. "Speculation is not helpful and is potentially dangerous," he said. "People should allow the police investigation to take its course and provide any information they have to detectives." However, the police officer did not go as far as entirely ruling him out as a suspect. "I am saying the investigation team into the murder of Jock Davison would remain open minded as to who is responsible," he told a news conference. The detective also appealed for "those with influence in the community to use all their efforts to reduce tension and appeal for calm and restraint at this very difficult time". The victim's elderly mother, Margaret McGuigan, told the BBC that her son's killers would have to live with what they had done. She added there had been "too many murders" in the area and that she hoped her son's would be the last.	A former Provisional IRA member murdered in front of his wife was shot dead in a "ruthless and premeditated killing", police have said.
The adapted artwork for the Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band album is worth about ??70,000. It was created to celebrate the success of the record - released in June 1967 - for Christmas of that year. The artwork is one of five Beatles album sleeves to feature in the top 10, compiled by Record Collector magazine. Sir Peter Blake's original Sgt Pepper collage was doctored to replace the faces of The Beatles and other notable figures with those of executives from the band's US label Capitol. Only about 100 are thought to have been made. 'Main attraction' In second place, valued at ??7,000, are the first 10 numbered copies of the Beatles' self-titled 1968 record, which became known as The White Album because of its plain white cover. The band's name was embossed on the front of the sleeve, which was designed by pop artist Richard Hamilton, along with a unique stamped serial number. In third position was a pair of sleeves designed by Andy Warhol. Madrigals' 1953 work Magic Key To Spanish Volumes 1 and 2, and spoken word anti-crime lecture The Nation's Nightmare, from 1951, have been valued at ??3,500 and ??3,000 respectively. At number four was the bizarre US-released compilation album Jolly What! England's Greatest Recording Stars: The Beatles and Frank Ifield on Stage. The 1964 album, featuring the songs of both the Fab Four and crooner Ifield, is valued at ??3,000. The Beatles  were also in eighth place for the original album sleeve created for the US release of their Yesterday And Today record in 1966, which is valued at ??2,000. Known as "the butcher sleeve" because it featured the musicians posing with dismembered doll parts and slabs of meat, it was quickly withdrawn from the US market. List compiler Ian Shirley, editor of the Rare Record Price Guide 2012, said: "While pristine records and inserts are vital to securing a top price, the numbered sleeve is the main attraction. "The hunger to collect low numbers remains undiminished amongst Beatles fans."	A Beatles sleeve which features the faces of music executives in place of the Fab Four has been named the world's rarest album cover.
Derby City Council wanted to shut Moorways Pool from April in a bid to save about Â£350,000 a year. The Labour-led authority, which needs to save Â£79m over the next three years, said it had found the savings by making cuts in other areas. Campaigners who gathered more than 4,000 signatures on a petition said they were delighted at the news. Ranjit Banwait, leader of the authority, said the council had committed to keep it open for a year. He said the council had identified savings "in back-office areas" and a restructuring of management jobs, which had been "untouched" since 2010. However, he stressed if the authority failed to get a "fair deal" from central government in the future, the pool would still have to close. Campaigners had accepted the pool, which is 33m in length, was in need of repair. There are plans for a new 50m pool to be built by 2018 to replace it. However, closing it would have left only one other public pool in the city - the Queen's Leisure Centre, they said. Doug Whitlam, of the Derbyshire Amateur Swimming Association, said: "One of the main things for me would have been the loss of teaching. "Twelve hundred young people use this facility every week and that would be lost forever."	A Derby swimming pool threatened with closure is to remain open for another year, council bosses have confirmed.
Joshua knocked out Wladimir Klitschko to add the WBA world heavyweight title to his IBF crown at Wembley Stadium last weekend. Afterwards the Englishman was hailed as "the biggest sports star in Britain". "Nothing would make us happier than having a Joshua fight at some point," Phillips told BBC Radio Wales Sport. Phillips says the stadium's roof - the only one of its kind in the United Kingdom - ensures the home of Welsh rugby can be used at anytime. "The stadium is an asset that we want to use," he continued. "When we're not playing rugby on it, we want to use it as much as we can so we've sort of driven that quite hard this year with concerts." Speedway, rugby league, football and boxing have all taken centre stage there and Phillips says talks are continuing with NFL chiefs over the possibility of hosting American Football. Joshua's stunning win over Klitschko added to his appeal and Tyson Fury has accepted the prospect of an all-British title bout. Welsh boxing legend Joe Calzaghe beat Mikkel Kessler in front of an estimated 50,000 fans at what was then named Millennium Stadium in November, 2007 Phillips, the joint stadium and Welsh Rugby Union chief executive, added: "We're in conversations with various boxing promoters. Find out how to get into boxing with our special guide. "Obviously the roof - we are the only big stadium with a roof - and it's been done before, obviously, with Calzaghe and so on, previously. "So nothing would make us happier than having a Joshua fight at some point." Get all the latest boxing news sent straight to your device with notifications in the BBC Sport app. Find out more here.	Principality Stadium chief executive Martyn Phillips would relish the chance to host an Anthony Joshua bout at the 74,500 capacity Cardiff venue.
His widow Daphne phoned the PM's office on Saturday to "kindly decline" the offer, Mr Abbott said. The commentator himself had wished for "something very, very quiet and very, very private", he added. Benaud, 84, is said to have died peacefully in his sleep on Thursday. He will be remembered in a private funeral attended only by his immediate family, Australian media reported. Mr Abbott told reporters on Sunday: "I thought it was important that as a mark of the respect that we have long had for him that we should offer a state funeral. "But my understanding is that Richie's own wishes were for something very, very quiet, and something very, very private." A pioneering leg-spin bowler, Benaud played in 63 Tests, 28 as captain, before retiring in 1964 to pursue a career in journalism and broadcasting including a long association with the BBC. His final commentary in England came during the 2005 Ashes series, but he continued to work for Channel Nine in Australia until 2013. Cricket Australia chairman Wally Edwards described Benaud as "the iconic voice of our summer".	The family of the late former Australian cricket captain and legendary cricket commentator Richie Benaud has rejected Australian PM Tony Abbott's proposal for a state funeral.
Second-quarter gross domestic product grew faster than expected, up from 0.4% growth in the previous quarter, the Office for National Statistics said. Any uncertainty ahead of last month's referendum seemed "limited", ONS said. However, by far the strongest growth was in April, followed by a sharp easing off in May and June. On a yearly basis the economy grew by a healthy 2.2%. The pick-up in economic activity was boosted by the biggest upturn in industrial output since 1999, particularly from car factories and pharmaceutical firms. ONS chief economist Joe Grice said that as well as the industrial gains, there was also "strong growth across the services sector, particularly retailing". "Any uncertainties in the run-up to the referendum seem to have had a limited effect," he said. "Very few respondents to ONS surveys cited such uncertainties as negatively impacting their businesses." Economists, including those at the Bank of England, had estimated second-quarter growth would be about 0.5%. Chancellor Philip Hammond said the better-than-expected figures showed the fundamentals of the UK economy were "strong". "It is clear we enter our negotiations to leave the EU from a position of economic strength," Mr Hammond said. But he also told the BBC's economics editor Kamal Ahmed it was "far too early to say how the economy is responding" to the referendum result. John McDonnell, Labour's shadow chancellor, said the figures bore little relation to the economic position of workers. "Today's GDP figures provide a stark contrast with the grim news on real earnings which remain 10% below their 2007 level," he said. "The Tories' failed austerity policy has produced a lost decade for earnings with ordinary households experiencing the worst decline in living standards in living memory." Industrial output, including manufacturing, grew by 2.1% in the quarter. The services sector, the largest part of the UK economy, grew 0.5%, while construction and agriculture fell 0.4% and 1% respectively. In April industrial production jumped 2.1% month-on-month, but then dropped 0.5% in May and rose only 0.2% in June. Services also started the quarter strongly, rising 0.6% in April, before dropping 0.1% in May and growing by only 0.1% in June. Looking in the rear view mirror doesn't always tell you much about the road ahead. And that is essentially what today's second quarter economic growth figures are about - a health check on the road behind us, not a snap shot of the here and now. Care does need to be taken with these figures. Firstly, they are only an initial assessment, and the data towards the end of the quarter will only be firmed up once the "revisions" are published over the next few weeks. What estimates we do have suggest that activity did fall off through May and June as the referendum approached. Second, the figures do not contain much information on what has happened to the economy following the June 23 vote. And certainly some of the data published since then have been pretty gloomy. Read more of Kamal's blog here. Analysts and business groups warned against using the second-quarter figures - which only included estimates of one week following the 23 June referendum - to measure the impact of the Brexit result. It is "far too soon to draw firm conclusions" about the UK's future growth prospects, the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) warned. "The significant contribution made by the manufacturing sector is particularly encouraging, but the improvements were from a low base, and the UK economy remains reliant on the service sector to drive growth," the BCC said. Ben Brettell, a senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the GDP figures "can't be taken as evidence of the current climate". "However, what they do show is an absence of pre-Brexit concerns, meaning that if the forecast downturn does materialise, at least we start from a position of relative strength," he said. A snapshot of the economy in the weeks after the referendum - from the closely-watched Purchasing Managers Indexes (PMIs) - suggested there had been a sharp fall in economic activity following the Leave vote. The economy seems to be heading towards a "significant deterioration" in the second half of 2016, according to the National Institute of Economic and Social Research. Connor Campbell, an analyst at Spreadex, agreed, saying: "Just because predictions of a slowdown pre-referendum appear to have been false, last week's early glimpse at the Markit PMIs shows that the post-Brexit impact is in no way a bogeyman conjured by bitter Vote Remainers." A separate survey released on Wednesday suggested that retail - one of the growth sectors in the second quarter - has suffered following the referendum. Retail sales volumes have declined more rapidly in July than at an time in the last four years, according to a survey by the CBI.	The UK economy grew by 0.6% in the three months to the end of June, as economic growth accelerated in the run-up to the vote to leave the EU.
A controversial firmware change made earlier this month meant HP printer owners using unofficial, usually cheaper, cartridges discovered they would no longer work. A campaign calling on HP to reverse the move was launched, backed by rights group the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF). In a blog post, HP admitted it should have done a "better job of communicating” the change. An optional update that removes the restriction on unofficial cartridges will be available “within two weeks”. The firm added: “We are committed to transparency in all of our communications and when we fall short, we call ourselves out." But while making the apology for how it informed users, HP defended the move, saying it did so to protect users from counterfeit products. "When ink cartridges are cloned or counterfeited, the customer is exposed to quality and potential security risks, compromising the printing experience,” wrote Jon Flaxman, the company’s chief operating officer. However, campaigners argued HP’s motivation was less about security, and more about protecting the large profit margins it adds to official ink cartridges. As consumers took to online forums and social networks to express anger, the EFF came down hard, saying HP had betrayed the public's trust. "Customers should be able to buy an HP printer without fear that the company will later place artificial limits on the printer’s use,” the group said. "It would be a security nightmare for customers to avoid installing security updates for fear of unwanted and unannounced feature changes." It also called on HP to explain how it planned to tell customers who may have been affected about the revised update. "Right now,” the EFF said, “the vast majority of people who use the affected printers likely do not know why their printers lost functionality, nor do they know that it’s possible to restore it. "All of those customers should be able to use their printers free of artificial restrictions, not just the relatively few who have been closely following this story."

Hughes qualified on residency this summer and features for the first time under head coach Eddie Jones. Leicester hooker Tom Youngs, who was overlooked earlier in the year by Jones, is recalled to the set-up. But Northampton's Luther Burrell, Chris Ashton of Saracens and Wasps' Danny Cipriani are notable omissions. Leicester flanker Will Evans and Harlequins back Joe Marchant, part of the Under-20s team who won the Junior World Championship in June, are included, while Gloucester wing Jonny May is named after recovering from a serious knee injury. England play South Africa, Fiji, Argentina and Australia later in the year, with Jones confirming his final 45-man squad at the end of September. However, this squad gives a clear indication as to Jones' thinking. "This camp sets the scene for November," said Jones. "It's important to catch up with the players prior to the start of the season and continue to put our plans in place. "We've chosen a number of new faces to attend this camp on the form they have shown recently or the potential we see in them. "Naturally players not included in this pre-season camp will be disappointed, but consistent high-level performances can change that." Northampton centre Burrell was part of the victorious touring squad to Australia, but was replaced after half-an-hour of the first Test win in Brisbane in June, and he has been omitted from the camp. After missing out on the tour of Australia because of a hamstring problem, centre Manu Tuilagi will be part of the camp, as will flanker James Haskell, despite suffering a foot injury which is set to rule him out of the autumn series. Leicester forward Mike Williams, like Hughes, is named for the first time under Jones, but Gloucester flanker Matt Kvesic misses out. Following the series win in South African with England Saxons, Wasps scrum-half Dan Robson, Mike Haley of Sale and Charlie Ewels of Bath are all involved. Other players in the camp who are uncapped at senior level are Josh Beaumont, Kyle Sinckler and Ben Te'o, with the latter two part of the tour down under. Forwards: J Beaumont (Sale Sharks), D Cole (Leicester Tigers), L Cowan-Dickie (Exeter Chiefs), J Clifford (Harlequins), W Evans (Leicester Tigers), C Ewels (Bath Rugby), J George (Saracens), E Genge (Leicester Tigers), T Harrison (Northampton Saints), D Hartley (Northampton Saints), J Haskell (Wasps), P Hill (Northampton Saints), N Hughes (Wasps), M Itoje (Saracens), G Kruis (Saracens), J Launchbury (Wasps), C Lawes (Northampton Saints), J Marler (Harlequins), M Mullan (Wasps), C Robshaw (Harlequins), K Sinckler (Harlequins), B Vunipola (Saracens), M Vunipola (Saracens), M Williams (Leicester Tigers), T Youngs (Leicester Tigers). Backs: M Brown (Harlequins), D Care (Harlequins), E Daly (Wasps), O Farrell (Saracens), G Ford (Bath Rugby), A Goode (Saracens), M Haley (Sale Sharks), J Joseph (Bath Rugby), J Marchant (Harlequins), J May (Gloucester Rugby), J Nowell (Exeter Chiefs), D Robson (Wasps), S Rokoduguni (Bath Rugby), J Simpson (Wasps), H Slade (Exeter Chiefs), B Te'o (Worcester Warriors), M Tuilagi (Leicester Tigers), A Watson (Bath Rugby), M Yarde (Harlequins), B Youngs (Leicester Tigers).

Kim Wall, 30, was last seen on Thursday evening on board the vessel with the owner, 46-year-old Peter Madsen. The submarine later sank and Mr Madsen was rescued before being arrested and charged with manslaughter. The stricken vessel, the Nautilus, has been raised but no body was found and the search for Ms Wall goes on. Mr Madsen initially said that he dropped Ms Wall off before it sank but police say he has now changed his statement - although they have not said what to. Police gave no other information on why they thought the Nautilus was deliberately sunk, but it contradicts Mr Madsen's explanation that there was a technical fault. Mr Madsen has denied involvement in Ms Wall's death, and will be held in custody for 24 days while investigations continue. Ms Wall's boyfriend first reported her missing after she failed to return from what should have been a short trip on the submarine. She had been writing about Mr Madsen and his submarine, which at one stage was the largest privately-made vessel of its kind. Police are still appealing for witnesses who may have seen Ms Wall on Thursday evening. "We're still hoping that we'll find Kim Wall alive, but we are preparing  ourselves for the fact that she may not be," Copenhagen police homicide chief Jens Moller said.	Danish police believe that a submarine at the centre of an investigation into a missing Swedish journalist was deliberately sunk.
Avon and Somerset Police closed the Lower Bristol Road in Bath at Rackfield Place outside the First depot after the crash at 03:00 GMT. The A36 road closure, which was lifted at 14:00 GMT, had caused disruption and delays to commuters and bus services during rush hour. Investigations are under way into how the collision happened. Local Live has all the latest travel news First said that while parts of its services had resumed a normal schedule, it would take a few hours for all services to return to normal. Managing director James Freeman said: "We are hoping we will have a full service running in time for the evening commute. "We would like to thank the public for their support and understanding and staff for going beyond their call of duty to help manage the situation and recovery."	A woman has died after her car crashed outside a bus depot trapping 150 buses inside.
Head coach Stuart Lancaster's World Cup preparations suffered a blow as for the first 70 minutes a largely first-choice XV struggled to deal with French power. Two late tries flattered the visitors, who have one game left before launching their World Cup campaign against Fiji on 18 September. "We gave away penalties and our discipline was shocking," said Robshaw. "Whether it was rust, or nerves, it wasn't good enough. Credit to France, they put us under pressure and made us make mistakes. "We gave too many penalties away, but in the second half we came out and played well but couldn't quite get over the line in the end," he told Sky Sports. "We can't give teams like France and other quality sides head starts like we did. "We'll look long and hard at ourselves, because we let ourselves down in the first half. We played well in phases but you can't wait for 40 minutes to do that." Late tries from Danny Cipriani and Jonathan Joseph made it close on the scoreboard but Lancaster was left with much to ponder by a disappointing team display in the Stade de France. Media playback is not supported on this device The head coach, who must announce his final squad by 31 August, added: "We've got to get our discipline at the breakdown - we can't give France easy position like we did. We need to improve on that, because all the little mistakes add up. "The bench made a difference. It upped the energy levels and we scored some good tries. I won't gloss over what went on before that, because it was too little too late. "There are a few players who have given me food for thought, those guys who came on and gave us the energy we needed and made a difference. "I need to have a sleep on this game and think about my final squad. We're two weeks away from playing Ireland and four weeks away from Fiji in the World Cup and we'll expect a reaction next time." England host Ireland in their final World Cup warm-up game at Twickenham on 5 September. Fly-half Ford told Sky Sports: "I thought we might snatch that at the end but we had hardly any ball in the first half and gave away too many penalties. We played some good stuff in the second-half. "In the first half a lot of our undoing was down to ourselves. We just weren't good enough in that first half and there's no excuse for that. We let them build up the score and that made it hard for us. "It was frustrating and we had to think of ways to adapt and that was constantly going through our minds. We tried to get ourselves out of a hole. "We've got to turn up against Ireland now and make sure that we win. Our basics have got to be world class."	Captain Chris Robshaw blamed England's "shocking" first-half discipline for their 25-20 defeat by France in Paris.
On Thursday, the Bank stunned the markets by keeping interest rates on hold, following speculation that it would cut rates from 0.5% to 0.25%. By lunchtime on Friday, the FTSE 100 was down 19.66 points at 6,634.81. The pound was up 0.27% against the dollar at $1.3379. Against the euro, it was unmoved at â‚¬1.2006. Among individual shares, airlines bore the brunt in the wake of Thursday night's Bastille Day attack in the French resort of Nice. Easyjet and British Airways owner IAG were down 3.5% and 1.8% respectively. At the same time, High Street mainstays Morrisons and Marks and Spencer fell 2.2% and 2% respectively. Other European share indexes were also down, reflecting market gloom at the French terror attack. The Cac index in Paris was down by about 0.8%, while Frankfurt's Dax also dropped about 0.8%.	UK shares have dipped further, while the pound is steady, as investors continue to digest the Bank of England's latest pronouncement.
Denny Solomona crossed for Castleford, but Wigan led at half-time against the run of play through Lewis Tierney's try and Matty Smith's penalty kick. Grant Millington's try put the visitors back in front, before John Bateman went over to restore Wigan's two-point lead. Nick Gregson got his first senior try and Bateman crossed again late on as Warriors climbed to third in the table. Having suffered their heaviest defeat in Super League since 2005 with a 62-0 loss to Wakefield in their previous fixture, Wigan started slowly but were good value for their win after the break. The hosts failed to take advantage when Luke Gale was sent to the sin-bin for dissent with the scores level in the first half, but Bateman's return to the side after two games out sparked the comeback. Shaun Wane's team also welcomed back Dom Crosby, who made his first Super League appearance of the season having recovered from a hip injury. Solomona moved clear as Super League's leading try-scorer with his 13th of the season, but Tigers were frustrated by improved Wigan defence in the second period as they suffered their fourth defeat in a row at the DW Stadium. Wigan coach Shaun Wane: "I don't want to keep going on about it. But, if you knew what we had gone through this week, there's so much toughness showed in that game against a really good Cas team. "The admiration I have got for my players, the desire to grind out the win with the circumstances that nobody knows about is unbelievable. "There were quite a few good performances, they are a good team and are well coached who know how to defend. "We're not the biggest team, but I thought the way we defended was outstanding." Castleford coach Daryl Powell: "That last try gave the score a bit of an easier look than it was. It was tight all the way through. "We lacked a little bit of quality in our play. I thought we defended awesome, they came at us in the second half with a game plan that put us under pressure. "They made minimal errors and kicked well and we couldn't find a spark to get us out of yardage and into good field position. "They deserved to win the game, they had more ball than us in decent field position and we had to work really hard to keep them out and that drained our energy reserves." Wigan: Sarginson; Tierney, Bateman, Gildart, Charnley; Gregson, Smith; Mossop, Powell, Clubb, Tomkins, Isa, Sutton. Replacements: Crosby, Tautai, Burke, Bretherton.

Tshibola, 20, came through the Royals' academy system and signed his first professional contract last summer. He made his professional debut against Nottingham Forest in August. Bingham, 21, joined Mansfield from Wigan Athletic in the summer and has scored four goals in 20 games for the Stags in all competitions. Pools are awaiting clearance from the Football Association and the Football League for the duo to feature against Wycombe Wanderers on Saturday.	Hartlepool United have signed Reading midfielder Aaron Tshibola on a one-month loan deal and Mansfield striker Rakish Bingham on a season-long loan.
This includes stadium safety expert Paul Scott. The Cabinet Office report found relations behind the scenes were "broken", and it would be at least another year before another planning application could be submitted. However, the authors said that a new stadium was still "achievable". They said the overall business case "remains sound". The report was commissioned after Mr Scott told a Stormont committee in April that the emergency-exiting arrangements in the proposed 38,000-capacity stadium were flawed. However, the report has recommended that he be replaced as chair of the Safety Technical Group overseeing the Casement project. The report has called for other personnel changes: Sports Minister Carál Ní Chuilín has indicated she will implement all of the recommended changes. She said a key finding that the stadium is still achievable was welcome and provided clarity. The report stated: "Relationships between the key stakeholders are broken. "We believe the use of an independent mediator will be needed to reset working relationships." Work on the stadium was supposed to start this year but planning permission was overturned in December 2014. The report stated: "The Casement Park project is behind schedule and has to address two key issues before it can make progress. "It needs to find a way to resolve issues raised with the proposed emergency-exiting arrangements for the stadium. "It also needs to reapply for and achieve planning permission." The report also included a "delivery confidence assessment" that is based on traffic lights, with green being the highest rating. Casement is rated "amber/red". Although the report recommends that Mr Scott be replaced as chair of the safety technical group, that does not mean he cannot continue to sit on the group. The report says his replacement will need mediation and facilitation skills "rather than technical knowledge". The chairman of the Stormont committee which is investigating Mr Scott's allegations said the Cabinet Office report "is part of the resolution but only part". Democratic Unionist Party MLA Nelson McCausland said the minister and her officials had more questions to answer. "This coming week we'll be convening a special meeting of the committee at Stormont and we will be requesting that the minister and the permanent secretary appear before the committee to answer the questions that we will be putting to them," he said.	A report into the planned new stadium at Casement Park in Belfast has recommended the replacement of senior figures from key posts in the project.
Caroline Wootton-Thomas, 49, forged colleague's signatures on cheques and transferred cash to a bank account she set up in her mother's name. She used the council's Child Protection Unit petty cash fund for debts, expensive gifts and luxury holidays. A Cardiff Crown Court jury convicted Wootton-Thomas, of Newport, of theft and transferring criminal property. The court heard she had asked to be put in charge of the petty cash fund which was meant to be used to cover fuel and parking costs. The grandmother was caught after a bank statement was sent to the wrong department. She denied any wrongdoing and blamed her colleagues for stealing the money, which the jury rejected. Matthew Roberts, prosecuting, said Wootton-Thomas had shown an "arrogance" which culminated in her mother also being charged with money laundering, though she was cleared at trial. Judge Neil Bidder said: "You have manipulated your mother in the most unscrupulous way. You took out a loan in her name to pay off your debts. "I've observed fake tears and not a jot of remorse for casting suspicion against other members of your team. "I regard the fact this money was reserved for vulnerable children to be an aggravating factor." A hearing in May will set out how she will be able to pay back the money.	A Cardiff council worker who stole £35,000 from a children's fund has been jailed for two and a half years.
The 23-year-old made 116 as Tim Groenewald and Lewis Gregory rattled through the rest of the hosts line-up. Jennings, who hit 15 fours, finally fell top-edging Josh Davey to gully before Durham were bowled out for 256. Tom Abell and Davey fell lbw to Rushworth, then Onions bowled Marcus Trescothick as Somerset closed on 30-3. Durham batsmen Mark Stoneman and Scott Borthwick both fell cheaply as Somerset started brightly before Jack Burnham (33) helped repair the innings in a 79-run third-wicket partnership with Jennings. Burnham eventually fell when he was bowled by Davey. Gregory then claimed two wicket in two balls, including uprooting Paul Collingwood's middle stump first ball, as Somerset looked to gain some momentum. Rushworth became Gregory's fourth victim of the day, departing to an exceptional slip catch from Jim Allenby it left the visitors with 12 overs to face. And last year's Division One leading wicket-taker struck in his fourth when Abell was trapped playing across the line before nightwatchman Davey was caught out in the next over when the ball nipped back. Onions' inswinging yorker then dismissed the Somerset captain as the away side limped to the close, trailing by 226 runs.	Keaton Jennings' century and three quick wickets from opening pair Chris Rushworth and Graham Onions gave Durham the edge against Somerset on day one.
This will affect businesses that use the VAT Flat Rate Scheme but which spend very little on goods, including raw materials - such as firms providing services. The VAT Flat Rate Scheme simplifies businesses' record keeping, and makes it easy to work out the VAT they have to pay. The proposed changes are the most important element of the Autumn Statement for this type of business. Normally a business deducts the VAT on its inputs (what they buy) from the VAT charged on what they sell (outputs). Under the Flat Rate Scheme, that two stage process is simplified to one step. For example, the flat rate percentage for a clothes shop is 7.5% - so if the owner of that shop sells a dress for £120 including VAT of £20 he will pay a flat rate of £9 (£120 x 7.5%) to HMRC.  The flat rate percentage for a detective agency is 12%. Exactly which sales count can be complicated - the details can be found on the HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) website. The percentages for each type of business vary - there is a list here. The flat rate scheme is designed to give the government roughly the same amount of VAT, but should be much easier to work out. However, because it is an approximation, some businesses will pay more, and some less.  The government is concerned that some businesses are using the Flat Rate Scheme to pay less VAT than is appropriate In the Autumn Statement, Chancellor Philip Hammond announced changes which affect businesses which have a very low cost base. These businesses are now called "limited cost traders". Limited cost traders can still use the Flat Rate Scheme, but their percentage will be 16.5%.  So if they sell £120 of work, including £20 of VAT, the flat rate amount is £19.80 (£120 x 16.5%). A limited cost trader is defined as one that spends less than 2% of its sales on goods (not services) in an accounting period. When working out the amount spent on goods, it cannot include purchases of: A firm will also be a limited cost trader if it spends less than £1,000 a year, even if this is more than than 2% of the firm's turnover on goods. It will increase the VAT paid by labour-intensive businesses where very little is spent on goods. For example, this may affect IT contractors, consultants, hairdressers and accountancy firms. It will also affect construction workers who supply their labour, but where the raw materials are provided by the main contractor. Mike Cherry, national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said: "Many small businesses rely on the optional VAT flat rate scheme to simplify the management of their tax affairs. "We welcome the government's attempts to clamp down on any misuse of this scheme by a small minority of businesses that use it. However we would be concerned if any small businesses who play by the rules now end up having to pay more to remain within the scheme. "Following these reforms, it is important HMRC now produces clear guidance so that small firms understand whether or not to join the scheme." The new rules start on 1 April 2017, but may also affect invoices issued, and goods bought, from now on. There is more about these "anti-forestalling" rules at sections 8.2 and 9.7 of the newly updated HMRC leaflet on the Flat Rate Scheme. The scheme can be more complicated than expected, and this note is only an overview, so be sure to read the guidance carefully.	Significant changes have been announced for the amount of VAT that many small businesses will have to pay.
18 January 2016 Last updated at 20:09 GMT Ben Frost, 27, barricaded himself into his girlfriend's flat in Princetown on Dartmoor on 18 January. He was arrested two hours after breaking through the roof, Plymouth magistrates heard. Unemployed Frost of no fixed address admitted two charges of causing criminal damage and two of threatening behaviour.	A man who sparked a drug-fuelled roof-top siege after breaking up with his partner has been given a suspended prison sentence.
The 32-year-old made the last of his 63 Test appearances in the 16-12 victory over Italy in Turin last month. Hamilton made his Scotland debut against Romania in November 2006. "I have loved every single moment of wearing the thistle and feel extremely humble to have done it for nine years," the Saracens player said on Twitter. "Today is both a sad day and a day that I feel extremely proud to have had. "Thank you to the Scotland supporters for making it so special." Hamilton was one of 11 players to miss out when Cotter cut his 42-man training squad to his final selection on Tuesday. John Barclay, Blair Cowan, Adam Ashe, Hugh Blake, Chris Cusiter, Alex Dunbar, Rob Harley, Ruaridh Jackson, Duncan Taylor and Greig Tonks were also omitted. Scotland open their World Cup Pool B campaign against Japan in Gloucester on 23 September. They then face United States in Leeds before meeting South Africa and then Samoa in Newcastle.

Media playback is not supported on this device First-half tries from Vincent Clerc and Maxime Medard opened a lead of 16 unanswered points as England shipped penalties and made basic errors across the park. England struck back with a fine try from Ben Foden and closed to within seven points with three minutes left when Mark Cueto capitalised on a break from replacement Matt Banahan. But they ran out of time and inspiration as Les Bleus set up a deserved semi-final clash with Wales. France, so poor in their pool matches, were a side transformed as they took revenge for their World Cup defeats of 2007 and 2003. "England were blown away in the first half and probably got a proper telling off. They came out with a little more pace and precision but they made too many mistakes with knock-ons, penalites and turnovers. England were never going to score from 80m out. "Those who have watched England before could see they were not any different but whereas Scotland and Argentina couldn't last the distance and England won late on, France were a different outfit." The defeat will leave manager Martin Johnson under pressure after his gamble of pairing Jonny Wilkinson and Toby Flood at 10 and 12 failed to ignite the England back line, while his forwards were repeatedly second best at the set-piece and in the loose. Johnson's contract expires in November, and four weeks as memorable for scandals off the pitch as any achievements on it will do little to appease the notoriously twitchy committee-men at the Rugby Football Union. France were supposedly a team in pieces, beaten by Tonga just a week ago and with coach Marc Lievremont publicly berating his players, but so clear-cut was their victory that much of the atmosphere had been sucked from the contest long before the end. England had an early opportunity with a line-out deep in French territory after a clever grubber from Foden only for Lionel Nallet to burgle back possession, and they then tore into France again as Alexis Palisson was smashed backwards after taking a garryowen and Manu Tuilagi thundered into Morgan Parra. After spluttering sporadically for four games, England's Kiwi campaign ended as it probably deserved to: in defeat, to a team that was more dynamic, more clinical and far more composed when it mattered most. Read more from Tom's blog But it was the most fleeting of false dawns. Dmitri Yachvilli slotted a penalty from distance after Flood failed to release his man on the deck, and France took a grip they would never relinquish. Wilkinson was struggling, sending the re-start straight into touch and flinging a pass the same way, and France then went close to the first try of the contest as Clerc took a long pass out on the left and was just bundled into touch by the corner flag. Yachvilli made it 6-0 with a second sweet strike from 45 metres after Matt Stevens was penalised for collapsing a scrum, and then slid another penalty just wide from the same spot. England's players had talked of "blitzing" France in the first 20 minutes, but it was Lievremont's men with all the menace and danger. Another line-out was stolen, and when the ball was sent left Clerc stepped and spun through limp challenges from Wilkinson, Chris Ashton and Foden to dive over and make it 11-0. England were once again static in their few attacks, only Tuilagi's bullocking runs offering any threat, Flood reduced to aiming a long-range drop-goal pit which missed by a street. Louis Deacon shipped another sloppy penalty, allowing Yachvili to kick to the corner, and after thunderous drives from the forwards left wing Alexis Palisson and Medard combined out wide to put the full-back in for France's second try. England were in disarray, only Yachvili's failures with the conversions keeping them in the game, and when they finally created space for their wingers Cueto was dragged down metres from the line before another wayward pass from Wilkinson shut the door on Ashton wide out right. England had never before come back to win from a margin of more than 12 points, and the errors continued to come thick and fast as Tom Croft became the latest to cough up the ball. They grabbed an unlikely lifeline when Ben Youngs took a quick tap and go to release Foden, who jinked and dummied his way over to make it 16-5 with 23 minutes left on the clock, Wilkinson popping over the conversion for 16-7. Johnson threw on his replacements but England kept wasting what good field possession they could work. Flood popped out a careless off-load deep in the French 22 to allow a clearing kick to snuff out the danger, and when Nick Easter tried to rumble from deep within his own 22 his hospital pass to Tuilagi triggered another knock-on. France, led by man-of-the-match Imanol Harinordoquy, set up camp in front of the English posts, and when the ball was fed back to Trinh-Duc the replacement fly-half slotted the drop-goal to make it 19-7. Banahan's late charge allowed Cueto to touch down for a try at the death, but with Flood's conversion sliding wide England needed a converted try to force extra time - something they could neither conjure nor say their performance deserved. England: Foden, Ashton, Tuilagi, Flood, Cueto, Wilkinson, Youngs, Stevens, Thompson, Cole, Deacon, Palmer, Croft, Moody, Easter. Replacements: Wigglesworth for Wilkinson (65), Banahan for Youngs (65), Corbisiero for Stevens (49), Hartley for Thompson (56), Shaw for Deacon (49), Lawes for Croft (46), Haskell for Moody (63). France: Medard, Clerc, Rougerie, Mermoz, Palisson, Parra, Yachvili, Poux, Servat, Mas, Pape, Nallet, Dusautoir, Bonnaire, Harinordoquy. Replacements: Marty for Rougerie (68), Trinh-Duc for Yachvili (53), Barcella for Poux (56), Szarzewski for Servat (56), Pierre for Pape (65), Picamoles for Harinordoquy (72). Not Used: Heymans.	England's World Cup dreams fell apart under a French onslaught on a night when their shortcomings were brutally exposed at the quarter-final stage.
Their recent run is in contrast to the way they started the season with six victories from their first seven games. Since the end of March, the Vikings' only wins have been in the Challenge Cup against lower-league sides. "We've got the personnel and we've got the people to spark us back into life," Betts told BBC Radio Merseyside. "When we get rolling again I'm sure, or I'm positive, that we can really turn this year around for ourselves." Widnes lie eighth after their poor run and face Salford at Magic Weekend on Saturday. "The players are hurting and we've got to win," added England assistant coach Betts. "Whether it be pretty, whether it be the last second of the game, we've got to win. "It's alright being a good group and it's alright talking about team spirit and being in it together, but not winning really hurts. "We've got to find that win and we've got to find it some way and that's within the team and it's in those 80 minutes out there."	Widnes head coach Denis Betts is confident his squad will find their form after a seven-match losing streak in Super League.
The dead driver was not a member of ambulance staff, police said, and working out how he was in the ambulance would form part of their inquiries. The Coastliner bus driver was seriously injured in the crash on the A64 at Flaxton, near York, at about 20:30 BST. Five of the 16 passengers on the bus and one of two people in the Toyota Yaris car were also taken to hospital. Yorkshire Ambulance Service said they could not confirm who the private ambulance belonged to but said it was not an NHS vehicle. The driver was pronounced dead at the scene. Police said there was nobody else in the vehicle with him. The bus driver was taken to Leeds General Infirmary, with serious but not life-threatening leg and abdominal injuries. The emergency services said the passengers were taken to hospitals in York and Scarborough and their injuries were also not life-threatening. The ambulance service said it was thought other passengers may have gone to hospital without their assistance and about four people received attention for minor injuries at the scene. The A64 has been closed while collision investigators examine the scene and police said it would remain shut for some time. They asked motorists to avoid the A64 near York. North Yorkshire Police are asking anyone who witnessed the crash or saw either of the vehicles before the collision, to contact them.	A man driving a private ambulance has died in a crash with a double decker bus and a car in North Yorkshire.
Joao Santana was widely seen as the architect of Ms Rousseff's 2010 and 2014 election victories. He has denied receiving bribes in a scheme to divert funds from the state-run oil company Petrobras. About 50 Brazilian politicians, including the leader of the lower house of Congress, are under investigation in the Petrobras corruption scandal. Mr Santana is accused of receiving bribes from several large engineering conglomerates. Analysts say the charge against him is a further blow for President Rousseff who is facing impeachment proceedings. He was arrested in February after he returned from the Dominican Republic, where he was working on the re-election campaign of President Danilo Medina. Because of his proximity to her, the arrest is expected to damaged her standing further, even though impeachment proceedings against her are not related to the Petrobras corruption investigation. A former journalist, Mr Santana is well known for producing dramatic, big-budget campaign videos appealing to poorer voters. Mr Santana had called the accusations "unfounded".  And he had harsh words for the investigation, saying that Brazil was currently living in a "climate of persecution". If the investigating judge accepts the allegations against him, Mr Santana will be jailed. In Brasilia, a special Senate commission has begun hearings ahead of a vote on whether the whole Senate should take on impeachment proceedings against President Rousseff. A plenary Senate vote is widely expected to take place around 11 May. Across the country,  pro-government supporters blocked major roads in cities in nine Brazilian states during Thursday's morning rush-hour to call for the halt of impeachment proceedings against President Rousseff. In Sao Paulo, the city saw hundreds of kilometres of traffic jams which formed behind roadblocks of burning tyres.	Brazilian prosecutors have filed corruption charges against President Dilma Rousseff's electoral strategist.
Imran Khan, 33, is accused of taking the girl from Nairne Street in Burnley, Lancashire, at 16:00 GMT on Thursday. Khan, of Pendle Street, Accrington, has also been charged with breaching a sexual offences prevention order and inciting a girl under 13 to engage in sexual activity. He was remanded in custody by Burnley magistrates. He is due to face the charges at the town's crown court on 23 April.	A man has been charged with the abduction of a six-year-old girl who was taken in a car.
The preliminary Caixin manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) fell to 47 in September, below forecasts of 47.5 and down from 47.3 in August. A reading below 50 indicates contraction in the sector, while one above shows expansion. The Shanghai Composite dropped 2.2% to 3,115.89 on the disappointing data. The private survey also marked the seventh consecutive month of contraction in the sector. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index closed down 2.3% at 21,302.91. Japanese markets are closed for a three-day public holiday and will reopen on Thursday. In Australia, shares in mining companies were hit by falling commodity prices. Oil prices continued to decline after US crude fell 2% overnight on global growth concerns, while copper prices slipped further on slowing Chinese demand. Sydney's S&P/ASX 200 index closed down 2.1% at 4,998.10. In South Korea, the Kospi index ended 1.9% lower at 1,944.64 following the release of the data from China.	Asian markets headed lower after a survey of China's manufacturing sector indicated it is shrinking at the fastest pace for six-and-a-half years.

Wearing boxing wraps around their palms and seated on a bench inside a gym in the eastern Indian city of Calcutta, two players match moves while huddled over a chessboard. Caught between the mind and muscle, the recently-introduced game of chess boxing is seeing an early surge of interest in India. The game involves alternate rounds of chess and boxing. In less than two years of its launch, 10 state-level associations organising championships have come up, while seven more states have shown interest in the sport. While bigger states like Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh have formed state-level teams, smaller north-eastern states like Tripura and Manipur are also represented. Of about 300 registered chess boxers in India, 195 and 245 players participated in the two national-level tournaments held in 2013. The figures are indicative enough for Iepe Rubingh, president of the Berlin-based World Chess Boxing Organisation (WCBO), to report in an email to the Calcutta-based Chess Boxing Organisation of India (CBOI) on India's potential to become "one of the leading nations in chess boxing". Globally, 13 countries, including the US, Germany, Russia, the UK and France, play the game. Newer entrants like Iran, China and India have bolstered its profile further. Twenty-seven-year-old Shailesh Tripathi from Mumbai became the first-ever Indian participant at the World Chessboxing Championship held in Moscow on 28 November. He put up a good fight at the competition. Tripathi, who has been a boxer for a decade and a chess player since his college days, says "the limits of body and brain are assessed at a global arena". "It is this combination that attracted me to the sport. If promoted well, chess boxing can gain immense popularity in India," he adds. To popularise the sport in India is the job of CBOI and its founder, Montu Das. Having been involved as a player in high-combat games, including kick boxing, since his childhood, Das was introduced to chess boxing through an online video and subsequently, the WCBO website. He was captivated by a game where the 11 competing rounds are split between six alternating rounds of chess and five three-minute rounds of boxing. At any stage, a checkmate or a knockout can decide the winner, besides other criteria. As a sport, chess boxing is still in its infancy. First conceptualised in 1992 by French cartoonist Enki Bilal in a graphic novel, it was reformatted for "modern times" by Mr Rubingh who felt having shorter-timed alternating rounds of chess and boxing would make the game more appealing for spectators. Mr Rubingh himself was a participant in the first WCBO tournament at Amsterdam in 2003. Chess boxing, according to the current Indian national champion in the senior 75-80kg category, Anurag Mathur, is balanced wonderfully between the mind and body. A former engineering student from Calcutta's Jadavpur University, he believes it takes some of the "mindless machismo out of boxing and the staidness out of chess". Mathur trains at the south Calcutta gym owned by Das. The same address also doubles as the India headquarters of the game, where young hopefuls like 22-year-old Mousumi Bar, silver medallist in the women's category in the first national tournament, practice their punch and marshal their minds. She became a kick boxer against the wishes of her parents so chess boxing has been a happy compromise for all involved. "My parents are happy that it isn't an all-out combat game," says Bar. "As a kick boxer, they would worry that an injury might hamper my marriage prospects." About 30% of registered chess boxers in India are women, informs Das. Ever since Das introduced the sport in India, his native city and state - Calcutta and West Bengal respectively - have seen multiple neighbourhood chess boxing clubs open up which have contributed about a third of CBOI's total membership. While it is reported that WCBO is lobbying for the game to be included as an Olympic sport, Das, on his part, is canvassing for official recognition from the Indian government's ministry of youth affairs and sports. So far, he says he has spent 250,000 rupees ($4,000; Â£2,443) in organising tournaments and promoting the game. At his gym, young chess boxers are aspiring to make it big, even if it takes much more than the sweat carried from the boxing ring to drip onto chessboards. Shamik Bag is a Calcutta-based journalist	Chess boxing, a hybrid sport combining the mental workout of chess with the physical challenge of boxing, is catching on in India, reports Shamik Bag.
Len Richards has been named as the new chief executive of Cardiff and Vale University Health Board (CVUHB). Mr Richards, who moved from the UK to Australia in November 2013, is expected to start his new post in June. CVUHB chair Maria Battle said he brought "broad international" experience to the role. Mr Richards is currently the deputy chief executive for South Australia Health, a government department responsible for public health in Adelaide. He said there was a lot of hard work to do on the board's financial situation, which is forecasting a Â£31m deficit for the 2016-17 financial year.	A new boss for health services in south Wales has been appointed all the way from Australia.
Russia is fuming, in the words of BBC Moscow correspondent Steve Rosenberg, but US politicians have not minced their words either. Here is a taster of what's being said and shared. Tweet by Dmitry Medvedev, Russian prime minister "Sad that the Obama administration, which started its life with a reset, ends it in anti-Russian death throes." "The outgoing American administration led by Barack Obama, while accusing Russia of all deadly sins, trying to accuse us, among other things, of the failure of its foreign policy initiatives, as you know, without grounds, has brought forward additional accusations that the Russian side - at state level - was interfering with the US electoral campaign, as a result of which the Democratic candidate lost. Yesterday the US administration, without presenting any facts, any evidence, announced a new wave of sanctions against Russia." Maria Zakharova, Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman, in a post on Facebook headlined 'Obama's Coming Out' "The people who have lived eight years in the White House are not an administration but a group of vindictive, unimaginative, foreign policy failures. Today [US President Barack] Obama admitted this officially. "Most surprising of all is that after failing to record any achievements in the international arena in the history of his presidency, the Nobel laureate has managed to sign off not with a flourish, but a blot... "Today America, the American people, has been humiliated by its own president. Not by international terrorists, not by enemy troops. This time it's Washington's chief delivering the slap in the face, ramping up the workload for the incoming team..." Zakharova says Jews backed Trump "Such actions of the administration in Washington are the demonstration, unfortunately, of an unpredictable, even aggressive, I can say, foreign policy. We think that such decisions of the acting administration, which is supposed to be in office for three more weeks, pursue two aims: finally (irrevocably?) spoiling US-Russian relations and, obviously, having an impact on the foreign policy of the future administration of the president-elect [Donald Trump]." "What these individuals were doing were basically collecting intelligence. They were intelligence officers operating here and using these compounds, one in New York, one in Maryland, for intelligence collection purposes. And what we are saying today is, in response to and in order to impose consequences for the Russian government's increasing harassment and aggression toward our personnel in Moscow, and, of course, their malicious cyber-activities, interfering and an effort to interfere in our election process, we are imposing consequences." "They [the Russians] are trying to destabilize democracy all over the world, not just here. It's just not about pulling for Trump, it's bigger than that. They're trying to break the backs of democracies. "Here's what we should do. We should tell the Russians that on no uncertain terms, you interfere in our elections, we don't care why, we're going to hit you and hit you hard. I'm going to introduce sanctions, they will be bipartisan that names Putin as an individual, his inner circle, for not only hacking into our political systems but trying to destabilize democracy throughout the world." "We need to get to the bottom of this. We need to find out exactly what was done and what the implications of the attacks were, especially if they had an effect on our election. "There's no doubt they were interfering and no doubt it was a cyber-attack. The question now is how much and what damage and what should the United States of America do? And so far, we've been totally paralyzed." "Russia does not share America's interests. In fact, it has consistently sought to undermine them, sowing dangerous instability around the world. While today's action by the administration is overdue, it is an appropriate way to end eight years of failed policy with Russia. And it serves as a prime example of this administration's ineffective foreign policy that has left America weaker in the eyes of the world."	The expulsion of 35 Russian diplomats from the US over the email hacking scandal has drawn a barrage of abuse from Moscow, which seems poised to respond in kind.
Wiggins and Cavendish are among eight medallists from the 2016 Olympic Games to be involved, along with Dutch road race silver medallist Tom Dumoulin. Owain Doull, who won team pursuit gold with GB in Rio and was third in the 2015 Tour of Britain, will also race. The eight-day event concludes in London on 11 September. "The field for this year's Tour of Britain is without parallel, with star quality wherever you look among the teams," said race director Mick Bennett. Thirty-time Tour de France stage winner Cavendish will make his first appearance since winning omnium silver at the Olympics, in a field that also features omnium gold medallist and Team Sky rider Elia Viviani of Italy, as well as the Manxman's sprint rival Andre Greipel of Germany. Wiggins is joined by Dylan van Baarle as former Tour of Britain winners in the field. A total of 21 teams will take part, including 11 UCI World Tour outfits, the highest number to have competed in Britain since the 2014 Tour de France Grand Depart. Seven British teams will compete, led by Team Sky and also including Team Wiggins and a Great Britain national team. The rider list also includes six current national road race champions, led by British champion Adam Blythe, who will ride for Great Britain. There are also six national time trial champions, including former UCI world hour record holders Alex Dowsett and Rohan Dennis and three-time world time trial champion Tony Martin.	Sir Bradley Wiggins and Mark Cavendish have been confirmed among 126 riders for the 2016 Tour of Britain, which begins in Glasgow on Sunday.
The Hollywood A-lister turned up unexpectedly at Sunrise of Sonning, a care home in Berkshire, on Sunday to treat resident Pat Adams. Staff had written to Clooney, who lives nearby, telling him a visit would make Pat's dreams comes true. "This was a classy gesture from a wonderful man," a Sunrise UK spokesman said. "She was absolutely thrilled to meet her great icon, and it was such a lovely surprise to see George greet her with flowers and a card." The spokesman said Clooney was holding the letter staff had sent to him when he rang the doorbell asking for Pat. He said staff regularly try to fulfil their residents' wishes as part of an ongoing programme, but added: "They didn't think they would be able to pull this one off." The care home's concierge, Linda Jones, posted on Facebook that she was in "utter shock" when she saw the Oscar-winning star arrive. She said that Pat "loves George Clooney and mentions everyday how she would love him to meet him". Clooney moved to Sonning, where he lives with his human rights lawyer wife Amal, in 2014.	George Clooney has surprised an 87-year-old fan with a bouquet of flowers for her birthday.
Hospital bosses made changes last August in a bid to help ambulances reach the emergency unit more quickly at the University Hospital of Wales (UHW) in Cardiff. Barriers were installed and traffic is not allowed to drive past the unit. The gridlock also led to people being late for appointments. Cardiff and Vale University Health Board is now planning to introduce a direct weekday park and ride service for patients, visitors and staff in a further bid to keep traffic off site. It will start on 2 May and operate from Cardiff East park and ride at Pentwyn from 06:30 to 19:15, running every 20 minutes, which should also free up car parking by 12%. There are also plans to introduce bus and cycle hubs at UHW. Geoff Walsh, director of capital, estates and facilities at Cardiff and Vale University Health Board, said: "The traffic management system was implemented to allow clear access for emergency vehicles onto the site which has been successful. "It has also improved the bus access with Cardiff Bus reinstating two services following the improvement of site accessibility." He added: "We are still looking at ways to stop people using the site as a thoroughfare."	The amount of traffic using Wales' biggest hospital as a "rat run" and causing gridlock has dropped by 7% after changes were made to the roads.
El Amrani, in a letter to African football associations, said he would be departing on Monday, but gave no reason for his decision. The 37-year-old Moroccan had served as secretary general for the last six years. Hayatou was deposed as Caf president 10 days ago at elections in Ethiopia, where six of his allies on the body's executive committee also lost their positions. The 70-year-old Hayatou had served as president for 29 years. Caf's new president, Ahmad, chaired a meeting with his staff at the African football body's headquarters in Cairo later on Sunday. During the meeting, the new president announced he had accepted the resignation of El Amrani.	The Confederation of African Football's (Caf) secretary general Hicham El Amrani resigned on Sunday, just over a week after long-standing president Issa Hayatou was ousted from power following defeat to Madagascar's Ahmad in the elections.
For a second time, he's giving up a role he didn't inherit, but gained on merit. After stints in the RAF and the air ambulance, his days as a pilot are coming to an end. He will miss them.  He's spoken of how he's loved working in a team. Something, he said, "his other job" didn't necessarily offer. The prince is the only senior royal to have a deep understanding of the National Health Service the majority of the population experience. With his family moving from Norfolk to London, Prince George will go to a private school from September. And Prince William and his wife will be available to do more royal work.  The demands will increase now the Queen has turned 90. The future king's exclusive focus will very soon be on his role as a Windsor and a destiny he'll one day embrace. Read full article	This will not have been an easy decision for Prince William to make.
The veteran broadcaster died of cancer on Sunday at the age of 77. The books, in Sir Terry's birthplace of Limerick, will allow people to mark the passing of "a true son of Limerick", the city's mayor Liam Galvin said. Evans told listeners of the BBC Radio 2 show that made Sir Terry's name: "He was the absolute governor." A condolence book for Sir Terry has also been opened in the entrance of the BBC's New Broadcasting House in London. In a career spanning 50 years, Sir Terry hosted TV chat shows, fronted the Eurovision Song Contest and was the face of Children in Need, while his long-running Radio 2 breakfast show regularly drew millions of listeners. At the start of his breakfast show on Monday, Evans said: "He was radio's Eric Morecambe, Ronnie Barker, he was our Captain Mainwaring, our Basil Fawlty but he made us laugh every day for two hours and for over 30 years. "All unscripted, all ad lib, always supremely assured, unwaveringly confident. "And do you know why? Because he never took any of this seriously, least of all himself. He was the butt of most of his jokes. "Laugh and the world laughs with you, sure, but Terry knew that if you go one better, and laugh at yourself then you're really onto something." Evans described Sir Terry as his "radio dad" and said that Radio 2 was "in disbelief and shock". "He taught me so much about being on the radio and not being on the radio," added Evans. "He was the absolute governor, everybody knows that." BBC Radio 4 Today presenter John Humphrys also paid tribute on Monday's programme, calling Sir Terry "one of the greatest broadcasters of our age". "Terry would be surprised by that description, at least, he'd affect to be. He liked to say that he never did anything, that required more than the minimal effort, and his success was down to 'natural laziness'. Which of course was complete rubbish," he said. "You didn't get to be the consummate professional he was by being lazy. It's true that he had a few God-given advantages - he was charming and articulate and witty and quick-thinking and whimsical and subversive and sardonic and, well, the list is a very long one. "But Terry had something else as well. He liked his audience, and they liked him. They felt he wasn't broadcasting to the nation, he was just talking to them." Prime Minister David Cameron told Jeremy Vine's BBC Radio 2 show Sir Terry was a "wonderful human being". "I remember growing up watching Blankety Blank and then the Eurovision Song Contest and he always made you smile, made you laugh. He had this fantastic sense of humour," he said. Veteran broadcaster Sir Jimmy Young, who worked with Sir Terry on Radio 2, said he was "stunned" at the news and that his condolences were "very much with Helen and the family". Sir Terry died surrounded by his family "after a short but brave battle with cancer", a statement released by his family said. He leaves his wife, Helen, and their three children. The couple also had a daughter who died in infancy. An online book of condolences will be hosted on Limerick's official website www.limerick.ie with separate books of condolence at council buildings in Dooradoyle and Merchants Quay opening on Monday morning. The city's mayor said: "Despite his fame and the fact that he was based in the UK throughout much of his career, Sir Terry often returned home to Limerick and never missed an opportunity on radio or TV to speak about his Limerick roots. "The council honoured him with the title of Freeman of Limerick in 2007, which I know was a title that meant very much to him and his family." President of the Irish Republic Michael D Higgins has said Sir Terry was "always proud of his origins in Limerick", and returned frequently to his native country. Family friend and broadcaster Henry Kelly added that he was "shocked" to hear of his death because Sir Terry had "put it out that he had a bad back". The Game For A Laugh and Going For Gold presenter knew the Wogan family as he had been friends with Sir Terry's younger brother Brian when they were at Belvedere College in Dublin. "I didn't know he was that seriously ill. I knew he'd been told not to do Children In Need because, as he quipped himself, they don't want an 'oul fella of 77 standing up for ten hours asking for money. "For so many people in this country, it is going to be like a death in the family - they adored Wogan," he added. Sir Terry had not been seen in public since November when he pulled out of hosting the annual Children in Need telethon. Blessed with a warm wit and a surreal sense of humour, Sir Terry was one of the BBC's most beloved broadcasters. His career even included a brief stint in the charts with his 1978 cover of The Floral Dance. He also provided the UK commentary for the annual Eurovision Song Contest for some 28 years, with many viewing his acerbic comments on the show as the highlight of the event. From 1972 to 1984 he presented the breakfast show on Radio 2 as The Terry Wogan Show, returning after a decade away in 1993 to front the re-branded Wake Up To Wogan. The second incarnation of the show regularly drew more than eight million listeners - dubbed TOGs, or "Terry's Old Geezers and Gals". Tributes poured in as news of his death was revealed on Sunday. BBC director general Lord Hall said: "He was a lovely, lovely man and our thoughts are with his wife and family.  For 50 years Sir Terry graced our screens and airwaves. His warmth, wit and geniality meant that for millions he was a part of the family." Radio 2 controller Bob Shennan said he was "one of the greatest and most popular radio hosts this country has ever heard". Sir Terry began his career on Ireland's national broadcaster RTE as a newsreader and announcer, moving into light entertainment before joining the BBC, where he would stay for the rest of his career. Radio 2 presenter Simon Mayo described him as a "radio genius", saying: "The staple of all great radio is the friend behind the microphone - and he was the ultimate friend behind the microphone." Sir Elton John paid tribute to Sir Terry on his Instagram account. The singer posted a picture of the two of them together, writing: "Such a special and funny man. "A brilliant broadcaster and presenter. He came to our civil partnership celebration and was a loyal supporter." Members of Sir Terry's BBC Radio 2 fan club Terry's Old Geezers and Gals (TOGs) have paid tribute to his work and commitment to charity. Norman Macintosh, who organises the TOGs conventions, told BBC Breakfast: "He was the gentleman and the ultimate broadcaster. "He talked to one person at a time and he felt like he was talking to you and he brought the whole audience into the show, and everyone felt like they were part of it." Sir Terry announced his retirement from Wake Up to Wogan in September 2009, making his final regular appearance three months later. When he broadcast at breakfast for the final time in 2009 he told listeners: "The years together with you have not only been a pleasure but a privilege. You have allowed me to share your lives with you. "When you tell me how important I have been in your lives it's very moving. You have been every bit as important in mine." Sir Terry, who continued to front a live Sunday morning show, last appeared on air on Radio 2 on 8 November 2015. The One Show: A Tribute to Sir Terry will be broadcast at 19:00 GMT on Monday 1 February.	Books of condolence have opened for Sir Terry Wogan, as his breakfast show successor Chris Evans paid tribute on air to "radio's Eric Morecambe".
The 24-year-old Tunisia international, who initially joined Lille on a season-long loan last summer, has agreed a three-year contract with Les Dogues. Sliti has made just five appearances since his return from the 2017 African Cup of Nations - where he played all four matches as Tunisia exited the tournament in the quarter-finals. He has played 16 games for Lille, scoring once - during November's 4-2 home victory against Caen. Sliti, who began his career with Sedan before moving to Paris FC in 2013, has won 11 caps for his country and scored three goals. Lille are 11th in the table going into Saturday's fixture against Metz.	French side Lille have exercised their option to sign Naim Sliti on a permanent deal when his loan move from second-tier side Red Star expires this summer.

The Swift Archway Cranford 545 caravan was stolen from a site in Yaxley, Cambridgeshire, on Thursday night. Davis tweeted "My touring caravan was stolen.. even though it was locked up with hitch & wheel lock! I want to swear... #rotters". He added the thieves could have "headed north or south on A1, or west on A14". Cambridgeshire Police said: "We have had a report of a caravan being stolen in the Yaxley area between 5pm on Thursday and 12.45pm on Friday. We are investigating." Davis, who played the role of Wicket in the third of the original Star War movies, is also appearing in the forthcoming Star Wars: Episode VII. Davis's credits include Professor Flitwick in the Harry Potter films and Nikabrik in The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian. Anyone with information about the caravan is asked to call Cambridgeshire Police.	Star Wars and Harry Potter star Warwick Davis, who played an ewok in Return of the Jedi, has taken to Twitter to help recover his stolen caravan.
Pink Dot has been held every year since 2009. Attendees wear pink clothing and sit down for a mass picnic that ends with the forming of a pink dot. But this year it falls on the eve of Ramadan, prompting an Islamic teacher to start a Wear White campaign against homosexuality, which has been supported by a Christian organisation. Gay sex is illegal in Singapore. Government leaders, as well as national organisations representing mosques and churches, have in recent weeks called on both religious and gay rights groups to act with restraint. The Pink Dot rally proceeded peacefully on Saturday evening with no sign of anti-gay campaigners. Organisers said 26,000 people attended the event. Wear White issued a statement saying it discouraged supporters from attending Pink Dot, as "it should be an event that no Muslim is associated with". Some chose to go online instead to protest at the event. About 4,000 people so far have taken part in a virtual rally called FamFestSG. Its Facebook page carries a quote from Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong that defines the term family as "one man one woman marrying, having children". The backlash has reignited the issue of gay rights in the largely conservative city-state. In recent years, there have been two legal attempts to declare that the law banning gay sex is unconstitutional. Singapore's government has said in the past that while it will retain the law to reflect mainstream society's stand on the issue, it will not be actively enforced.	An annual gay rally in Singapore has drawn thousands amid an unprecedented backlash from religious groups.
This was a key rebel demand during drawn-out talks which led to a peace deal in August. All foreign forces were meant to have left by 10 October. Meanwhile, a rebel leader has told the BBC the deal is unlikely to work and said he may take up arms again. Tens of thousands of people have died since the civil war began in 2013. Uganda's defence chief Gen Katumba Wamala told the press that all soldiers should be out by 1 November. Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Henry Okello Oryem added in a statement that Uganda's intervention "helped to stop what was likely to be the worst genocide in the region". Uganda has not revealed how many troops it has in South Sudan, where they are supporting the government. But they are stationed in three bases: The international airport in Juba; in Nesitu just south of the capital and at their biggest base in the town of Bor, which is hosting some 3,500 soldiers. The BBC's Catherine Byaruhanga in Uganda says that a neutral regional force is meant to step in once Uganda withdraws but it is not clear when that will happen. Senior rebel leader Gen Johnson Oloni said he might resume fighting because of President Salva Kiir's recent decree creating 18 new states. He called the plan a "naked power-grab", the BBC's Tim Franks reports from South Sudan. He also said the government was undermining the deal with attacks on civilians. The rebel leader said land appropriations had pushed his ethnic group to use force in the past and they could do so again. Gen Johnson is head of the Shilluk militia, which has been accused by the UN children's agency Unicef of abducting hundreds of boys and forcing them to become child soldiers. The US had proposed that he should be subject to a travel ban and assets freeze, along with an army chief, but this was blocked by Russia and Angola at the UN Security Council. South Sudan's elusive peace: Five obstacles to peace in South Sudan Men of dishonour South Sudan gained independence from neighbouring Sudan four years ago making it the world's youngest country. Two years later, in December 2013, a conflict erupted after President Salva Kiir accused Riek Machar, his sacked deputy, of plotting a coup. Mr Machar denied the allegation, but then formed a rebel army. Much of the fighting has been carried out along ethnic lines, between Mr Machar's Nuer group and Mr Kiir's Dinka, the two dominant ethnic groups in South Sudan.	Ugandan troops will start leaving South Sudan by the end of this week, according to the head of the Ugandan force in the country.
The Suffragette Oak in Kelvingrove Park won a public vote from six trees shortlisted in the Woodland Trust Scotland competition. It was nominated and championed by Glasgow Women's Library. The oak will now compete with entries from 15 other countries to decide the 2016 European Tree of the Year. Wendy Kirk, from Glasgow Women's Library, said she was "thrilled" the Suffragette Oak was chosen as the winner. She said: "I'm sure that the suffragettes would have been delighted to know that nearly 100 years on the tiny sapling they planted has become the Scottish tree of the year." Carol Evans, director of the Woodland Trust Scotland, said: "One of the reasons for holding the competition is to uncover the hidden history that many trees represent and to encourage people to value and care for them."	An oak tree planted in Glasgow nearly 100 years ago as a tribute to the city's suffragettes has been named Scotland's Tree of the Year.
His signing follows the news that the Stags could be without injured striker Alex Fisher for four weeks. Oliver, 23, signed his first professional contract with his hometown club Sheffield Wednesday. He left the Owls in 2012 and made an immediate impact at Lincoln City, scoring 14 goals in 41 matches, before joining Crewe last summer. Oliver could make his debut at York on Saturday.	Forward Vadaine Oliver has joined Mansfield Town on an emergency one-month loan from Crewe Alexandra.
The girls were "touched inappropriately" in the Castaway Camp playground at the park in Windsor, Berkshire, on Thursday 11 August. Thames Valley Police refused to give the suspect's age or say where he was arrested, citing "safeguarding issues". The boy has since been released on police bail until 2 December. Police previously issued an E-fit of a suspect, who was described as a white man in his teens or early twenties. Officers said he was white, under 5ft 8in tall, wearing dark slim-fitting trousers, a dark t-shirt and trainers. Police began following up new leads in September after a reconstruction was shown on BBC One's Crimewatch. A 22-year-old man previously arrested on suspicion of carrying out the attacks was released without charge. Thames Valley Police said: "This is remains a live investigation and we continue to appeal for the public's help".	A boy has been arrested in connection with the sexual assault of two six-year-old girls during a trip to Legoland.
Dyfed-Powys Police said training would begin on Wednesday ahead of them being deployed on the streets. Cameras are always on but only record once the officer presses a button. Police and crime commissioner Dafydd Llywelyn said: "The use of the cameras supports transparency in policing and will aid the investigation of complaints against officers." The move follows a three-month trial in 2015 and any member of the public has the right to request footage taken of them within 31 days. Any recordings not needed for policing purposes are automatically deleted from cloud storage after that time. The force said recordings would only be made if there was "a policing need" and officers would announce when they start and stop filming. Cameras will always be on standby, filming on a 30-second loop, but audio does not record until the officer presses the button. Chief Constable Mark Collins said: "They will provide the public with more reassurance and will help officers to document valuable evidence - leading to swifter justice for victims."	A police force has begun the rollout of body cameras for 800 officers and community support officers.
Saturday's flyby swept the probe into an orbit that takes it in between the planet's rings and its atmosphere. This gap-run gives the satellite the chance finally to work out the length of a day on Saturn, and to determine the age of its stunning rings. But the manoeuvre means also that it cannot escape a fiery plunge into Saturn's clouds in September. The US space agency (Nasa) is calling an end to 12 years of exploration and discovery at Saturn because the probe's propellant tanks are all but empty. Controllers cannot risk an unresponsive satellite one day crashing into - and contaminating - the gas giant's potentially life-supporting moons, and so they have opted for a strategy that guarantees safe disposal. "If Cassini runs out of fuel it would be uncontrolled and the possibility that it could crash-land on the moons of Titan and/or Enceladus are unacceptably high," said Dr Earl Maize, Nasa's Cassini programme manager. "We could put it into a very long orbit far from Saturn but the science return from that would be nowhere near as good as what we're about to do," he told BBC News. Cassini has routinely used the strong gravitational field of Titan to adjust its trajectory. In the years that it has been studying the Saturnian system, the probe has flown by the haze-shrouded world on 126 occasions - each time getting a kick that bends it towards a new region of interest. And on Saturday, Cassini pulled on the gravitational "elastic band" one last time, to shift from an orbit that grazes the outer edge of Saturn's main ring system to a flight path that skims the inner edge and puts it less than 3,000km above the planet's cloud tops. The probe will make the first of these gap runs next Wednesday, repeating the dive every six and a half days through to its death plunge, scheduled to occur at about 10:45 GMT on 15 September. Scientists used Saturday's pass of Titan to make some final close-up observations of the moon. This extraordinary world is dominated at northern latitudes by great lakes and seas of liquid methane. Cassini's radar was commanded once again to scan their depths and look for what have become known as "magic islands" - locations where nitrogen gas bubbles up from below to produce a transient bumpiness on the liquid surfaces. This is a bitter-sweet moment for scientists. Titan has yielded so many discoveries, and although the probe will continue to encounter the moon in the coming months, it will never again get so close - less than 1,000km from ground level. On the other hand, researchers have the prospect now of at last answering some thorny questions at Saturn itself. These include the length of a day on the planet. Cassini so far has not been able to determine precisely the gas giant's internal rotation period. From the close-in vantage afforded by the new orbit, this detail should become apparent. "We sort of know; it's about 10.5 hours," said Prof Michele Dougherty, the Cassini magnetometer principal investigator from Imperial College, London, UK. "Depending on whether you're looking in the northern hemisphere or the southern hemisphere - it changes. And depending on whether you're looking in the summer or winter seasons - it changes as well. "So, there's clearly some atmospheric signal which we're measuring that's linked to weather and the seasons that's masking the interior of the planet," she told the BBC. The other major outstanding question is the age of Saturn's rings. By getting inside them, Cassini will be able to weigh the great bands of ice particles. "If the rings are a lot more massive than we expect, perhaps they're old - as old as Saturn itself; and they've been massive enough to survive the micrometeoroid bombardment and erosion and leave us with the rings we see today," conjectured Nasa project scientist Dr Linda Spilker. "On the other hand, if the rings are less massive - they're very young, maybe forming as little as 100 million years ago. "Maybe a comet or a moon got too close, got torn apart by Saturn's gravity and that's how we have the rings we see today."

Briton Eleanor Hawkins, Canadians Lindsey and Danielle Peterson, and Dutchman Dylan Snel admitted causing a public disturbance. The group was blamed for a magnitude 5.9 earthquake after stripping on Mount Kinabalu, which is considered sacred. They were jailed for three days, but their sentences were back-dated to reflect time already served. A judge at Kota Kinabalu Magistrates' Court said the four had shown remorse and ordered the jail terms to run from 9 June, meaning the group is free to leave. He also fined each defendant 5,000 Malaysian ringgit (Â£860/$1,330). The BBC's Jennifer Pak, who was in court, said she understood the group were now waiting to pay their fines before being deported. Hawkins' lawyer Ronny Cham said the 23-year-old, from Draycott in Derbyshire, would be freed from police custody later on Friday and her release documentation was being arranged. She would then fly home to the UK on Saturday, her lawyer said. Her father Timothy Hawkins said the sentence was "appropriate and fair" but it appeared she had been "treated pretty badly" amid the media scrum outside court. "She's obviously very traumatised," he said. "Eleanor knows what she did was wrong and disrespectful and she is deeply sorry for any offence she has caused to the Malaysian people." Foreign coverage of the story has been criticised in the Malaysian press. Several local newspapers accused British tabloids of exaggerating reports that the tourists were arrested for causing the quake, rather than the actual charge of public indecency. The Sabah-based Daily Express accused the papers of running "sensational" headlines, while the country's most popular English-language paper, The Star, said reports (pictured) alleging Hawkins and the others were arrested for angering mountain gods "couldn't be further from the truth". Tourism minister, Masidi Manjun, said their acts would have merited punishment for breaking local laws and norms whether or not the earthquake took place. Mr Masidi, who comes from the foothills of Mount Kinabalu, was also quoted in the Malay Mail as saying there had been some "fact-twisting" by foreign media. "I don't know whether this is on purpose just to ridicule us, or their failure to appreciate our local traditions and customs," he said. Speaking to reporters outside his home, Mr Hawkins said the family were looking forward to his daughter's return. "We do not know when this will be as we've had no contact from the High Consulate in Malaysia, and we've not spoken to Ellie," he said. She and her co-accused all admitted a charge of "committing an obscene act in public". Prosecutors said the four tourists, along with six others, climbed the peak to enjoy the sunrise on 30 May and then challenged each other to take off their clothes. But the court amended the facts to agree the accused did not tell the guide to "shut up" or "go to hell", as the prosecution had alleged. Their lawyer said they had simply ignored pleas not to remove their clothes, and had not verbally abused the guide. Mr Cham, who representing all four defendants, said they were ignorant of local customs and "their act had brought shame and ridicule upon themselves and their respective countries". He asked the judge to not make an example of them, saying the intense international media coverage had traumatised them enough. The prosecution argued the public interest was central to the case and, according to Malaysian law, anyone committing an "obscene act" which causes annoyance in a public place should be jailed for up to three months. Many Malaysians had been outraged by the group's behaviour, he said, and the case was about "upholding the [country's] morals and customs". Earlier, the four arrived at court accompanied by officials wearing balaclavas. The accused covered their faces as they entered the building, surrounded by a media scrum. "There's a lot of public anger still against the tourists because many of them believe Mount Kinabalu is a sacred spot where their souls go to rest when they die," Ms Pak said. "The fact that these foreigners are alleged to have stripped on the peak, urinated and cursed at staff members trying to stop them is something that many locals say is disrespectful." Last Friday, an earthquake struck killing 18 people, including children, and leaving hundreds more stranded. Sabah state deputy chief minister Joseph Pairin Kitingan blamed it on the travellers showing "disrespect to the sacred mountain". News agency AFP said police were still seeking five other suspects but some were thought to have already left Sabah.	Four tourists who posed naked on a mountain in Malaysia have been given jail terms and fined.
But the council is to set up a group to "resolve outstanding design issues". The proposed cycle route will link Leith Walk in the east of the city to Roseburn in the west, via the city centre and Haymarket. The plans include reducing four lanes of traffic from Roseburn to Haymarket to two, and using half a carriageway and a bus lane for cyclists. Supporters of the path said it was vital for cutting congestion and would provide a safe route across the city. They said it would also encourage more active travel. But residents and shop owners in the Roseburn area said reducing loading bays to make way for bikes would have a huge impact on passing trade, and that reducing traffic lanes could increase congestion at Roseburn. The council said the new working group would be set up to help resolve outstanding design issues with the plans. It said work would start immediately to secure further funding and to "make preparations to commence the necessary statutory processes for the scheme". A final decision will be taken after the the working group's discussions. Transport convener Councillor Lesley Hinds said the council was still "100% committed" to the project but acknowledged it had divided opinion. She said a new group would be formed to try to reach a conclusion on the final route design "which the majority are happy with". Ms Hinds added: "Given the strength of feeling out there about certain aspects of the plans, there's clearly still work to be done before the final route design is agreed."	Plans for a controversial cycle path through Edinburgh have been agreed in principle by city councillors.
I give him the benefit of the doubt - his arguably blasé attitude, I think, is a symptom of being consistently called upon to defend his creation. He is the co-creator of Tor, the most popular software available for gaining access to the part of the internet unreachable using a conventional browser - including what is often referred to as the dark or underground web. To some, Tor is a menace: a (largely) impenetrable system that enables some of the most depraved crimes to take place on the internet. To others, it is a lifeline, the only way to safely access the online services that most of us take for granted. Dingledine would rather we talked about the latter. The scale of the dark web - with its drug deals, weapons sales and child abuse imagery - is insignificant when considered in the bigger picture, he argues. But we must talk about the former. I meet Dingledine at this year's Def Con, the large underground hacking convention held in Las Vegas. The timing was ideal - the event came just over a week after the closure of two huge dark web marketplaces. The biggest, Alphabay, was said to boast more than 200,000 users and $1bn (£0.7bn) a year in revenue. Dingledine's talk was the day prior to our meeting, and in it he criticised misinformed journalists for sensationalising the size and scale of the dark web. "I think a lot of it comes down to incentive mismatches," he tells me, "where journalists have to create more controversy and get something so that everybody will want to read their article. "The story is privacy is under threat around the world, and that's been the story for a while - so they need a new story." The Tor Project's website has a section called "Abuse FAQ". It is here the group attempts to address the most controversial side of Tor use: that it is an enabler of criminals intent on carrying out the most shocking and sickening crimes. When talking about this, Dingledine invokes the "guns don't kill people" defence. Tor does not commit crime, he says, criminals do. "I would say that there are bad people on the internet and they're doing bad things, but Tor does not enable them to do the bad things. "It's not like there's a new set of bad people in the world who exist because Tor exists." I guess not. But I suggest that Tor indisputably provides a way in which a novice can make themselves essentially untraceable online. "I still think that most of the bad stuff on the internet has nothing to do with Tor," Dingledine insists. "Most of the bad stuff on the internet is due to huge criminal organisations. There's a lot of crime out there." In layman's terms, Tor hides your identity by pinging your connection around many different servers across the world, making your actual location extremely hard to track. There have been rumours that law enforcement has "cracked" Tor but, aside from isolated vulnerabilities, Dingledine says the concept remains solid. "As far as I know, no, they haven't [cracked Tor]. "Tor is the best option there is out there, but that doesn't mean Tor is perfect. No software is perfect." Any major busts and arrests have been traced back to human error - good old, old-fashioned policing. "Which is frustrating," Dingledine interjects, "Because the modern police world wants to just click a button and have the bad guy show up. Old-fashioned police work is hard, takes energy." Tor was mentioned in the documents leaked as part of Edward Snowden's whistleblowing in 2014. Under the delicate heading "Tor Stinks… but it could be worse", the National Security Agency (NSA) noted: "We will never be able to de-anonymise all Tor users all the time." Given this, you would think the US (and others) would be taking every step to weaken Tor. Ban it, even. But in fact, the US government has done more than any other to keep it alive - donating several million dollars to Dingledine and team since the project's inception in the nineties. He is confident that funding will continue. "A lot of the US government funding for internet freedom tools comes from Republicans. The current congress is quite supportive of giving people tools to keep people safer on the internet." The reason? The FBI, CIA, military and others all value anonymity too. In their ideal world, Tor would exist, but they would hold a secret key to break in. In 2014, Facebook's London team announced it had set up a way for users to access Facebook through Tor. More than a million people use the site in this way every month. "About 97% of Tor traffic has to do with people going to Facebook, and Wikipedia, and BBC, and ordinary websites on the internet, and they want to go there more safely," Dingledine says. "Whereas 3% of the traffic has to do with this 'dark web' thing…. I have to wave my hands when I say the phrase." The ability to access social networks anonymously is invaluable to people living in oppressive regimes or countries with high levels of surveillance around what citizens do online. But given the majority of users can be found in the US and Europe - in places not typically considered to be oppressive - I argued that Tor's justification hinging on the needs of activists perhaps seems less than convincing. "I think the line is getting a lot more blurry between the free countries, and the un-free countries," he says. ___________ Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC You can reach Dave securely through encrypted messaging app Signal on: +1 (628) 400-7370	When Roger Dingledine talks about the dark web, he waves his hands in the air - as if not quite convinced of its existence.
Kayleigh Haywood, from Measham in Leicestershire, was found dead last November. Stephen Beadman, 29, of George Avenue, Ibstock, admitted raping and murdering the teenager at a hearing in April. He and Luke Harlow, 27, also of George Avenue, are on trial at Nottingham Crown Court after both denied a charge of false imprisonment. Harlow had also previously pleaded guilty to sexual grooming and two counts of sexual activity with a child. Miranda Moore QC, prosecuting, told the jury that Kayleigh went willingly to Harlow's flat in Ibstock, Leicestershire on 13 November. She believed they were in a "secret relationship" after chatting on Facebook for about a fortnight, the court heard, and had told her family she was staying with her best friend. Harlow - who called himself "Luke Fun Times Harlow" online - told the teenager she was his "princess" who he would "love and treasure forever". "On that night Kayleigh had been given substantial amounts of alcohol and she had been sexually touched by Luke Harlow," said Ms Moore. "She was underage and he knew it.  He was later to lie about that, pretending to people that she was much older." Ms Moore said the false imprisonment charge centred around what happened to Kayleigh between 21:00 and 03:00 BST on 14 and 15 November. Both men are alleged to have held Kayleigh against her will. The jury heard that at one point, Kayleigh had tried to escape Harlow's flat and was seen by a witness leaving the property naked from the waist down. "What happened to her in that property to make her flee into the night?" Ms Moore said. "What we know is that she was chased by Mr Beadman and pinned to the ground. This was seen by somebody from their upstairs window. "At some point, far from being this drunken, compliant girl, Kayleigh became somebody who wanted to get out of that flat." Ms Moore said that the witness mistook Beadman for a policeman. Beadman then took her "off into the night, where she was raped and murdered by him". After Beadman had been by interviewed by police for three days and directed officers to a location on the outskirts of Ibstock. Her body was then discovered in thick undergrowth near a stream. Following examinations of Harlow's phone, police discovered he had sought to groom other girls. His intention was to kidnap them, get them drunk, have sex and keep them in his flat, the jury was told. "Kayleigh Haywood was not the only girl Luke Harlow groomed," Ms Moore said. "She was the last in the line." He has also admitted attempting to meet two other underage girls for sexual purposes. Police from across the East Midlands helped with the hunt for the teenager after she went missing on 13 November. A passerby found Kayleigh's smashed phone on the ground in Ibstock. The last number she had dialled was the number of the friend she said she was staying with. An inquest heard she died from head and facial injuries. The trial - which is expected to last until next week - continues.	A 15-year-old girl was seen fleeing a house half-naked before a man chased, raped and murdered her, a court heard.
Media playback is not supported on this device The Italian is picking up the fallen champions after a desperate 2015-16 campaign that saw Jose Mourinho sacked just months after winning the title - and also after some undistinguished early performances this season. Conte is becoming one of the league's most compelling personalities - so how is he mixing pure theatre in his technical area with the job of pointing Chelsea back in the direction that sees them fighting for the big prizes once more? Conte's touchline antics stand alongside Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp as a visual spectacle, which means the eye can sometimes be drawn to watching the touchline as much as the action. And Conte was a blur of perpetual motion again on the Stamford Bridge sidelines in the 2-1 win against Spurs on Saturday - but the top coaches never lose control and the Italian knows there is a time and a place to keep a lid on the emotions. Conte was involved in a long and heated exchange with fourth official Bobby Madley when an apparent handball by Harry Kane was not spotted in the second half. It ended with an outstretched hand of understanding that was graciously reciprocated by Madley. He was also visibly desperate to inject more urgency into Chelsea as they were outplayed by Spurs for 44 minutes until Pedro's equaliser was the catalyst for a complete momentum shift. It was a drama played out with maximum animation as his voice could be heard above the crowd. And the body language - occasionally leaping up and down on the spot - making him look like he was auditioning for Riverdance. There is, however, substance to back up his frenzied technical area style. Conte's half-time messages, bolstered by the equaliser, were clearly received and understood by Chelsea's players as they carried out his instructions to put pressure on Spurs and play at the higher tempo that suits them. He is transmitting his desire to Chelsea's players, with goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois saying after the Spurs win: "He's passionate like that every day, every session and that's great for us because it keeps us focused and sharp." It has also roused Stamford Bridge, with Chelsea's fans warming to Conte and chanting his name constantly on Saturday night. Conte's sideshow may be eye-catching but his blood remains cool enough to make the right tactical moves that ensured Chelsea saw out the closing stages of this tight contest in relative comfort. Conte was keen to stress he wanted his work, and the fact that Chelsea are back on top of the table, to stay low-key and be treated with modesty. "We must continue to work, improve and we must stay humble," said the 47-year-old. And that is clearly what he intends to do for one of the biggest games of the season when they travel to Pep Guardiola's Manchester City next Saturday lunchtime. For all the emotion on the touchline, Conte is quietly spoken and measured in his press conferences with an increasingly impressive command of English. As Courtois hinted, Conte is obsessive about his work and all the traits he developed in Italy are being brought to bear as Chelsea look unrecognisable from last season. Conte was known as "The Hammer" by some members of the Italian media for the demands on his players, often ringing them at 11pm during his time at Juventus to advise them of changes to training schedules, keeping them on their toes. He even produced a document on players' diet and his exacting standards have not dropped since he took over the office at Chelsea's Cobham training base. As he once said himself: "There are situations in which you are the hammer and in which you are the anvil. We have to understand the role of the technical staff is of the anvil." He also has the miles on the managerial clock to know how to handle every eventuality. Conte was sacked as coach of Italian Serie B side Arezzo in October 2006, but rehabilitated his career with Bari, Atalanta and Siena before winning three successive Serie A titles with Juventus and taking charge of Italy's national team. Former Italy striker and Chelsea manager Gianluca Vialli, who was captain when Conte was a player at Juve, told BBC Sport during Euro 2016: "Football is his life and therefore he wears his heart on his sleeve. He doesn't try to be someone else. After the game he is a very pleasant, quiet guy - but during the 90 minutes he wants to win." And winning is something he is becoming very good at with Chelsea. Chelsea's dressing room is regarded as one of the most powerful and influential in the Premier League. There have been previous accusations of player power - rejected by those inside the dressing room - but it is "so far so good" with Conte. And a testimony to the harmonising effect he has had can be seen with the presence of John Terry on the substitutes' bench. The 35-year-old has been unable to regain his place since injury and a switch to Conte's favoured three-man defensive system left him on the margins. Terry accepts his situation is being shaped by successful results and in conversation with former Chelsea team-mate William Gallas, he praised Conte's straight-talking, honest approach and said: "If I don't get back in the team it means Chelsea are winning and at the minute we are not conceding goals. It possibly means we are going to win the league and if that's with me or without me that doesn't matter." Conte trusts his players, which is evident from the improvement in forward Pedro and fellow striker Victor Moses after loan spells at Liverpool, Stoke City and West Ham. He has flicked the switch with forward Eden Hazard but has decided midfielder Cesc Fabregas is someone he can currently do without. And what of the warhorse Diego Costa? He is also a beneficiary of Conte's methods. He wanted the infamously combustible striker to keep his cool after a couple of red card near-misses at the start of the season. While Costa will never be a peaceful presence on the pitch he has clearly listened, taking two heavy bangs early on against Spurs but not retaliating in the manner of old. Costa certainly knows who is boss after his demand to be substituted during the 3-0 win against Leicester City to avoid a yellow card and possible suspension for the game against Manchester United was studiously ignored. Of course all is usually sweetness and light when victories are coming easily, but Conte is determined to do it his way at Chelsea or not at all. Conte's watershed moment appeared to arrive very early at Stamford Bridge after miserable performances in the 2-1 home defeat to Liverpool and a 3-0 loss at Arsenal in late September. After that Arsenal defeat, Conte trusted his tactical instincts and reverted to three at the back with David Luiz, Gary Cahill and Cesar Azpilicueta. He used  Andrea Barzagli, Giorgio Chiellini and Leonardo Bonucci in similar roles for Juventus and Italy. The result? Seven successive Premier League wins and only one goal conceded since the day Chelsea lost at Arsenal and sat in 10th place, eight points behind then-leaders Manchester City, who they now lead by one point going into next week's meeting. Ironically, since the Arsenal game they have had less percentage possession - 52.79% against 56.88% - than they had in the matches before. Chelsea have also had fewer shots, an average of 16.7 up to the Arsenal game compared with 15.4 after, but they have become a much more efficient machine. The manner in which Liverpool pressed Chelsea into submission, and the way Arsenal cut them open with three first-half goals clearly left Conte with food for thought. The results since have proved Conte is determined to learn the ways of the Premier League and take decisive action. Chelsea's place at the Premier League summit is the reward.	Chelsea's win over Tottenham at Stamford Bridge not only restored them to the top of the Premier League, it also offered up further evidence of the impact manager Antonio Conte has as he rebuilds the club from the trauma of last season.
Scientists in London created an artificial windpipe which was then coated in stem cells from the patient. Crucially, the technique does not need a donor, and there is no risk of the organ being rejected. The surgeons stress a windpipe can also be made within days. The 36-year-old cancer patient is doing well a month after the operation. Professor Paolo Macchiarini from Italy led the pioneering surgery, which took place at the Karolinska University Hospital. In an interview with the BBC, he said he now hopes to use the technique to treat a nine-month-old child in Korea who was born with a malformed windpipe or trachea. Professor Macchiarini already has 10 other windpipe transplants under his belt - most notably the world's first tissue-engineered tracheal transplant in 2008 on 30-year-old Spanish woman Claudia Costillo - but all required a donor. The key to the latest technique is modelling a structure or scaffold that is an exact replica of the patient's own windpipe, removing the need for a donor organ. To do this he enlisted the help of UK experts who were given 3D scans of the 36-year-old African patient, Andemariam Teklesenbet Beyene. The geology student currently lives in Iceland where he is studying for a PhD. Using these images, the scientists at University College London were able to craft a perfect copy of Mr Beyene's trachea and two main bronchi out of glass. This was then flown to Sweden and soaked in a solution of stem cells taken from the patient's bone marrow. After two days, the millions of holes in the porous windpipe had been seeded with the patient's own tissue. Dr Alex Seifalian and his team used this fragile structure to create a replacement for the patient, whose own windpipe was ravaged by an inoperable tumour. Despite aggressive chemotherapy and radiotherapy, the cancer had grown to the size of a golf ball and was blocking his breathing. Without a transplant he would have died. During a 12-hour operation Professor Macchiarini removed all of the tumour and the diseased windpipe and replaced it with the tailor-made replica. The bone marrow cells and lining cells taken from his nose, which were also implanted during the operation, were able to divide and grow, turning the inert windpipe scaffold into an organ indistinguishable from a normal healthy one. And, importantly, Mr Beyene's body will accept it as its own, meaning he will not need to take the strong anti-rejection drugs that other transplant patients have to. Professor Macchiarini said this was the real breakthrough. "Thanks to nanotechnology, this new branch of regenerative medicine, we are now able to produce a custom-made windpipe within two days or one week. "This is a synthetic windpipe. The beauty of this is you can have it immediately. There is no delay. This technique does not rely on a human donation." He said many other organs could be repaired or replaced in the same way. A month on from his operation, Mr Beyene is still looking weak, but well. Sitting up in his hospital bed, he said: "I was very scared, very scared about the operation. But it was live or die." He says he is looking forward to getting back to Iceland to finish his studies and then returning to his home in Eritrea where he will be reunited with his wife and young family, and meet his new three-month-old child. He says he is eternally grateful to the medical team that has saved his life.	Surgeons in Sweden have carried out the world's first synthetic organ transplant.

It took the World War Two prime minister's coffin from London to Oxfordshire in 1965. The restoration cost about Â£30,000. Look North's Ian Reeve reports.	A railway carriage that carried Sir Winston Churchill's coffin to his final resting place has been restored in County Durham.
The Medical Research Council team showed severely damaged organs in mice could be restored to near-normal function. They say the findings, published in Nature Cell Biology, could eventually help people stuck on a waiting list for a transplant. Further tests are now taking place with human tissue. The liver does have a remarkable ability to heal itself. Even if half of the organ is removed, it can grow back. The team, based at the University of Edinburgh, has been investigating the regenerative potential of the liver. Normally, the main type of cell in the liver - hepatocytes - is able to restore the organ. But one of the researchers, Prof Stuart Forbes, said: "The hepatocytes normally divide beautifully, but eventually they give up that ability to keep dividing, they become senescent, and that is something we see in all forms of severe liver injury." So the Edinburgh team turned to a closely related group of stem cells from the biliary duct. Injecting these cells into damaged mouse livers led to near compete regeneration. Prof Forbes added: "The big aim would be to develop a clinically applicable cell therapy for patients with severe liver failure where transplantation is not an option." The team say tissue from livers unsuitable for transplant could be a source of these cells. However, Prof Forbes said liver transplants would remain the main option for patients and encouraged people to join the donor register. Further studies will now focus on repeating the results with human tissue. Dr Rob Buckle, the director of science programmes at the Medical Research Council, said: "This research has the potential to revolutionise patient care by finding ways of co-opting the body's own resources to repair or replace damaged or diseased tissue."	Transplanting cells into livers has the potential to completely regenerate them, say scientists.
Mewn cam annisgwyl, wrth siarad o flaen 10 Downing Street, dywedodd fod y wlad yn dod at ei gilydd yn dilyn pleidlais Brexit y llynedd, ond nad oedd gwleidyddion y gwrthbleidiau yn San Steffan wedi gwneud hynny. Bydd pleidlais yn cael ei chynnal yn y Senedd ddydd Mercher ar argymhelliad y Prif Weinidog, ac mae'r blaid Lafur wedi dweud y bydd yn pleidleisio gyda'r llywodraeth. Rhaid i Theresa May dderbyn cefnogaeth y senedd i gynnal etholiad cyn dyddiad swyddogol yr etholiad nesaf oedd wedi ei chlustnodi - yn 2020. Byddai etholiad cyffredinol ym mis Mehefin yn sicrhau arweinyddiaeth gref a chadarn wrth i'r llywodraeth gynnal trafodaethau gyda'r Undeb Ewropeaidd yn y misoedd i ddod, meddai Mrs May. "Ar foment genedlaethol arwyddocaol fe ddylai fod undod yn San Steffan ond yn lle hynny mae rhwygiadau. Mae'r wlad yn dod at ei gilydd ond dyw San Steffan ddim." Dywedodd Mrs May bod y pleidiau eraill yn gwneud eu gorau i lesteirio amserlen y DU i adael yr Undeb Ewropeaidd. Ychwanegodd: "Mae ein gwrthwynebwyr yn credu bod mwyafrif y llywodraeth mor fach y byddwn yn simsanu, y gallen nhw ein gorfodi i newid llwybr. Ond maen nhw'n anghywir. "Os nad ydyn ni'n cynnal pleidlais gyffredinol rŵan bydd eu gemau gwleidyddol yn parhau." Dywedodd hefyd bod y rhwygiadau yn peryglu ymdrechion y llywodraeth i gael bargen dda i Brydain wrth adael ac yn achosi "ansefydlogrwydd" i'r wlad. Ychwanegodd ei bod wedi bod yn gyndyn o gymryd y cam o alw am etholiad, ond y byddai'r etholiad er budd y wlad. Dywedodd arweinydd y blaid Lafur yn San Steffan, Jeremy Corbyn: "Rydw i'n croesawu penderfyniad y Prif Weinidog i roi cyfle i bobl Prydain i bleidleisio dros lywodraeth fydd yn rhoi buddiannau'r mwyafrif yn gyntaf." Ychwanegodd arweinydd y Ceidwadwyr Cymreig, Andrew RT Davies mai dyma'r "penderfyniad iawn i'r wlad". "Rydyn ni eisiau i Gymru a Phrydain ddod allan o'r cyfnod yma yn gryfach, yn decach ac yn edrych fwy tuag allan nag erioed, ac fe fyddwn ni'n glynu wrth ein cynllun ar gyfer Prydain gryfach," meddai. Ond yn dilyn ei chyhoeddiad, trydarodd Prif Weinidog Cymru Carwyn Jones: "Wel, nes i ddim gweld hynny'n dod. Mae galw etholiad yng nghanol etholiad arall yn od. Proses heddwch Gogledd Iwerddon yn cael ei hanwybyddu?" Ychwanegodd mewn ail neges: "Mae'n rhaid i mi ddweud nad yw'r etholiad yma "er budd y wlad". Dylai'r ffocws fod ar Brexit a'r economi, nid polau piniwn." Dywedodd arweinydd Plaid Cymru, Leanne Wood: "Mae llywodraeth y DU wedi ymrwymo ein gwlad i lwybr economaidd afreolus eithafol. "Mae Cymru angen ASau fydd yn herio'r Torïaid a bod yn llais rhesymol yn y Senedd, gan amddiffyn cysylltiadau economaidd hanfodol ein gwlad gydag Ewrop a gweddill y byd." Cafodd y cyhoeddiad ei groesawu hefyd gan arweinydd UKIP yn y Cynulliad Neil Hamilton: "Mae hyn yn gyfle gwych i'r etholwyr bleidleisio i gael gwared â'r ASau oedd eisiau aros yn rhan o'r UE yng Nghymru, ac ethol AS UKIP fydd yn cynrychioli eu buddiannau yn y senedd." Ychwanegodd Mark Williams, arweinydd y Democratiaid Rhyddfrydol yng Nghymru y byddai'r etholiad yn "gyfle i newid cyfeiriad y wlad". "Os ydych chi eisiau osgoi Brexit caled, os ydych chi eisiau cadw Prydain yn rhan o'r farchnad sengl, os ydych chi eisiau Prydain sydd yn agored, goddefgar ac unedig, dyma'ch cyfle," meddai. Dywedodd arweinydd y Blaid Werdd yng Nghymru, Grenville Ham fod yr etholiad yn "gyfle gwych i roi stop ar lymder" gan fod "pleidiau wedi dilyn ideoleg sydd wedi gorfodi caledi diangen ar y bobl fwyaf tlawd ac anghenus ym Mhrydain". O dan reolau'r Ddeddf Cyfnod Seneddol Sefydlog, does gan y Prif Weinidog ddim hawl i gyhoeddi etholiad cyffredinol ar fyr rybudd heb gefnogaeth aelodau Tŷ'r Cyffredin. Yn ôl y polau piniwn diweddaraf, mae gan y Ceidwadwyr fantais sylweddol dros y blaid Lafur - gyda'r Torïaid 21 o bwyntiau ar y blaen yn ôl YouGov. Bydd yr etholiad sydyn hefyd yn golygu y bydd pobl Cymru'n pleidleisio dros 40 o Aelodau Seneddol, yn hytrach na 29 o aelodau, fel oedd wedi ei fwriadu petai'r newidiadau i ffiniau seneddol wedi dod i rym cyn etholiad 2020. Cafodd Mrs May ei hethol yn Brif Weinidog ym mis Gorffennaf 2016, lai na mis wedi'r refferendwm ar adael yr Undeb Ewropeaidd. Fe wnaeth ei rhagflaenydd David Cameron, oedd wedi bod yn brif weinidog ers 2010, ymddiswyddo y diwrnod wedi'r bleidlais Brexit.	Mae'r Prif Weinidog Theresa May wedi cyhoeddi y bydd yn gofyn i Dŷ'r Cyffredin bleidleisio o blaid cynnal etholiad cyffredinol ar fyr rybudd ar 8 Mehefin.
An international team of maritime archaeologists are diving, excavating and recording the wreck of Dutch ship the Rooswijk off the Kent coast. All 300 shipmen died when the vessel, carrying coins and silver ingots, sank on Goodwin Sands in January 1740. Never before have any of the Dutch East India Company's 250 wrecks been scientifically excavated on this scale. Historic England manages the protected site and is working with the Dutch government, which owns the ship's remains. It is only now, after more than 250 years, that the sands have shifted enough to unveil the wreckage. Some explorations were carried out last year and those finds are being showcased as part of the #Rooswijk1740 project, led and financed by the Cultural Heritage Agency of the Netherlands, with open days in Ramsgate between 19 August and 16 September. They include a large seaman's chest, pewter jugs, ornately carved wooden knife handles and leather shoes. The current mission will see archaeologists delve further into the storage rooms and living quarters in the stern of the ship. Martijn Manders, project leader of the Rooswijk Excavation and Maritime Heritage programme manager at the Cultural Heritage Agency of the Netherlands, said: "The Goodwin Sands has been a treacherous place for ships throughout the centuries and is now a treasure trove for archaeologists. "The rapidly shifting sands mean that the site is even more exposed now than it was during our initial dives to assess the condition of the Rooswijk last year. This makes the excavation urgent." The wreck is high on the Heritage at Risk register due to its exposed remains and vulnerability to the shifting sands. Alison James, maritime archaeologist at Historic England, said: "Wrecks such as the Rooswijk are time capsules that offer a unique glimpse into the past and tell a story. "We look forward to the fascinating insights and discoveries that the Rooswijk excavation will uncover this summer."	A ship excavation is expected to reveal a "treasure trove" of items and stories from Europe's global trading history.
The members of the FSB, the Russian intelligence agency, conspired with criminal hackers, according to DOJ officials announcing the charges. Previously, Yahoo said "state-sponsored" hackers were behind the 2014 breach affecting 500 million accounts. The suspects are also alleged to have targeted Google accounts. Hacking was directed at Russian and US government officials, including security, diplomatic and military personnel, according to the DOJ. The indictment also alleged that 30 million Yahoo accounts were commandeered without authorisation for use in a spam campaign. "We will not allow individuals, groups, nation states, or a combination of them to compromise the privacy of our citizens, the economic interests of our companies, or the security of our country," said acting attorney general Mary McCord, announcing the charges. The suspects were named in a DOJ press release as: Baratov was arrested on 14 March in Canada. One of the alleged hackers has been on of the FBI's most wanted cyber criminals for more than three years, according to acting Att Gen McCord. The suspect in question, Alexsey Belan, was aided by the FSB who - according to the DOJ - provided him with "sensitive FSB law enforcement and intelligence information that would have helped him avoid detection by US and other law enforcement agencies outside Russia". "We would hope [Russia] would respect our criminal justice system and respect these charges," said acting Att Gen McCord, acknowledging the fact that the US does not have an extradition treaty with Russia. "The United Kingdom's MI5 made substantial contributions to the advancement of this investigation," added FBI executive assistant director Paul Abbate. Yahoo was criticised for the delay in informing users about the 2014 breach. The stolen data included names, email addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth and encrypted passwords, but not credit card data, according to Yahoo. Last year, users were advised to change their passwords. Around eight million UK accounts were believed to have been affected - including some users of BT and Sky email services. "The indictment unequivocally shows the attacks on Yahoo were state-sponsored," Yahoo said in a statement, responding to the DOJ announcement. "We are deeply grateful to the FBI for investigating these crimes and the DOJ for bringing charges against those responsible." The DOJ said that the charges have no connection to the hack on the Democratic National Convention last year.	Two Russian spies are among four individuals indicted by the US Department of Justice (DOJ) over a huge theft of Yahoo user accounts.
Midfielder Kirby, 23, has played more than 100 times for Rovers since 2012 and has agreed a one-year extension. Defender Gumbs and midfielder Duggan, both 20 and former academy players, have also signed one-year deals. Defenders Buxton, 25 and Ridehalgh, 26, who has made more than 150 appearances for Rovers, have both signed contracts until the end of the 2018-19 season.	Jake Kirby, Adam Buxton, Evan Gumbs, Mitchell Duggan and Liam Ridehalgh have all agreed new deals with Tranmere.
They were on board an anti-piracy vessel, the Seaman Guard Ohio, which was detained in October, 2013. They face charges including straying into Indian waters and carrying weapons without permission. Another British man, Paul Towers from Yorkshire, remains in jail along with the ship's Ukrainian captain. News of the men's release was confirmed by an international maritime lawyer who is close to the case. He said: "Yes, they are out. Checking in to hotel and looking forward to a beer." The five men freed on bail were: Billy Irving, 33, of Oban in Argyll, John Armstrong, of Wigton, in Cumbria, Nick Dunn, 28, of Ashington in Northumberland, Ray Tindall, 38, of Chester, and Nicholas Simpson, originally of Cottingham in East Yorkshire. All of them must remain in India. Their employer AdvanFort, a maritime security patrol specialist, has always insisted the men were working to provide protection to other ships from pirate attacks. Nick Dunn's sister Lisa has commented on social media: "After 169 horrific days that Nick Dunn has spent in prison and another five being detained on the ship, I'm over the moon to say that the first hurdle is now cleared ... he's out!"	Five British men who were being held on arms charges have been freed on bail from an Indian jail, according to a lawyer close to the case.
So far troops have rescued 150 people from the worst-hit site in central Kegalle district, but hopes are fading for another 134 still unaccounted for. No more people were found overnight, dead or alive - on Wednesday 14 bodies were pulled from the mud. Five more bodies were found at the site of another mudslide in the district, bringing the death toll there to 10. Landslides and flooding caused by days of torrential rain have hit many parts of the country, killing at least 43 people in total, according to official figures. Nearly 350,000 people have been displaced. In the worst-hit area, Aranayake district, three villages were buried after a huge section of hillside sheared away in the rain on Tuesday. Bad weather is hampering the army's efforts to reach possible survivors. "I fear the missing 134 could be dead at this point," Maj Gen Sudantha Ranasinghe, the officer in charge, told BBC Sinhala. "But we will continue our operation to recover the bodies to give families some peace." We started to climb up to the disaster site with troops who were going back on Thursday morning to continue to search for survivors. However they suspended their mission and evacuated the area along with us and some villagers who had returned. Rain was beating down on the collapsed mountain again, creating a risk of further landslides. We had to take shelter in a tiny schoolroom on higher ground. Villagers we spoke to were losing hope of finding any more survivors. We waded through mud and silt to reach the foot of the mountain where most of the devastation has taken place. Army units have identified several places where people may have been buried in the landslide. In one of the villages, Pallebage, local resident PG Sekara said: "The army keeps going up the mountain, but they're not going to find anything. To find survivors they will have to dig about 40 feet now." Prema Adikari said she feared she had lost her brother and his family. "My brother's house is completely destroyed. They were inside when the mudslide started. His 15-year-old daughter and his wife were also in the house,"  she told BBC Sinhala. "When it rains, the canal waters nearby get so loud - they had not heard the neighbours warning. Only one member of the family remains, my nephew, who had gone to the shops nearby when the landslide struck. At least we want to see their bodies." At Bulathkohupitiya, the site of the second, smaller landslide in Kegalle district, six people are still reported missing. Sri Lanka's monsoon rains often bring floods but officials say these are the worst for several years. Many displaced people have moved to shelters, and officials have appealed for water, dry food rations and sanitary items. Low-lying coastal areas have also been hit. In southern India the authorities are on alert as the rains move up the country's east coast. At least 280 people died in a month of heavy rains and floods in the city of Chennai and other parts of Tamil Nadu state last year. The rains, the heaviest there in a century, were blamed on climate change although city officials were also criticised for being unprepared. Other parts of India have been suffering a severe drought in recent weeks.	Sri Lankan teams searching for scores of people missing after a landslide fear there may be no more survivors.
They feature on the International Impac Dublin Literary Award's 2016 longlist, alongside BBC journalist Kirsty Wark's debut The Legacy of Elizabeth Pringle. Libraries in 118 cities around the world nominated 160 books. The 100,000 euro (Â£71,300) prize winner will be announced on 9 June 2016.

Past winner Colm Toibin from Ireland is nominated again for Nora Webster, while another former winner, Norwegian Per Petterson, is on the list for Out Stealing Horses. "Reading groups worldwide each year anticipate the longlist and later the shortlist with excitement and interest," said Dublin city librarian Margaret Hayes. "From previous experience we know that the 21st winning title will be top of the library readers list for 2016 at home and abroad, bringing readers together in an unparalleled international book club." Jim Crace won the prize last year for his novel Harvest, while Irish author Kevin Barry won for his debut novel, City of Bohane, in 2013. This year's Man Booker Prize-winner, A Brief History of Seven Killings by Marlon James, and the winner of the 2014 Governor General's Award for Fiction, The Back of the Turtle by Thomas King, are also nominated. The full list of British titles in the running:	The Silkworm by JK Rowling's pseudonym Robert Galbraith and Ian McEwan's The Children Act are among 25 British novels in the running for the world's richest literary prize.
Chelmsford Prison told residents there had recently been "numerous incidents" of packages being hurled over the wall. One former inmate said the jail was "notorious" for being "flooded" with mobile phones and synthetic cannabis. The Ministry of Justice said staff worked "extremely hard" to stop contraband from getting into prisons. "However more must be done, which is why the Justice Secretary has asked us to look at how we can ensure prisons have the tools in place to tackle this kind of problem," the spokeswoman added. Follow updates on this story and other news from Essex A woman who lives near the prison, who did not want to be named, said she had witnessed packages being thrown over the wall "four times in two weeks." "It's getting quite bad at the minute. The prison wants us to come to an evening to talk about what to do if anything does get thrown over," she said. "I don't feel frightened, but obviously it's not nice - I always lock the doors and everything." The former inmate claimed drones were used to fly contraband goods "straight up to prison windows", but the Ministry of Justice said there was no evidence of drones coming into the Chelmsford site. The spokeswoman said laws had been introduced which mean people who smuggle packages over prison walls could be jailed for up to two years.	A prison has written to people who live nearby asking them to help stop packets of "illicit articles" being thrown over the jail walls.
Police briefly detained the protesters. The envoy was questioned on Friday after his Indian wife alleged he sexually abused their three-year-old. Although a case has been registered against him, he has not been arrested or formally charged. The envoy has made no public comment as yet. Police say they are trying to confirm if the man has diplomatic immunity. The wife of the envoy has written to the French ambassador in India and the Indian government, to prevent her husband from leaving the country until all legal proceedings are complete. She has also asked the French Embassy for financial support for herself and her three children, who are French citizens. The French Consulate-General in Bangalore confirmed that "a complaint had been lodged regarding the rape of a minor girl who is a French national". "The complaint names the father of the child, who is a consular agent of this Consulate-General. An investigation is under way for which this Consulate-General is extending its full cooperation with the police and the authorities in charge," the Consulate said in a press release on Monday. "It remains also in touch with the family of the child," it added. The complaint was lodged on Thursday night, after the envoy's wife approached the Bangalore-based non-governmental organisation, Enfold India, for help.	Demonstrations have been held outside the French consulate in the Indian city of Bangalore demanding the arrest of a French official accused of abusing his daughter.
A poster for conference call firm Powwownow shows a man on an underground train surrounded by zombie-like characters in masks. Changing Faces says the adverts are "insensitive" because of the similarity to masks worn by people recovering from burns. Powwownow says the images are not targeting those with facial disfigurements and instead show characters from "fantasy horror". In one advert, a woman is shown in the middle of a group of people wearing masks similar to that of Jason, the main character of the Friday The 13th movie franchise. In a blog post, Changing Faces chief executive, James Partridge, said the tagline of the campaign - Avoid the Horror - was "disturbing". He wrote: "It reinforces the harmful association that people who wear masks as part of their treatment and who have burn scarring, are to be feared and avoided." Changing Faces says Powwownow originally agreed to take down the adverts. In a statement to Newsbeat, a spokesman from the conferencing service said: "When we received a complaint from Changing Faces, we pulled the advert as a mark of respect to the charity's perspective and undertook a review of the advertising strategy. "After this robust review, we reinstated the advert as a reflection of our belief in the creative concept, its clear reference to the fantasy horror genre and the fact that we are in no way targeting or discriminating against people with facial disfigurement, or indeed any people. "The adverts focus purely on the horror of the commuting experience and in no way target any individuals." Catrin Pugh from Wrexham sustained burns to her face and body when the coach she was travelling in crashed in France in 2013. She's been undergoing treatment ever since. Speaking to Newsbeat, she said: "Wearing my compression mask is why my face looks 'normal' and was one of the most important parts of my treatment. "This advert, suggesting people in masks are 'horrors' makes me so angry." "I remember when I first went out into the public wearing my mask, and due to my eyesight I couldn't see it, but my sister said almost everyone turned and gawped. "If that is then associated with being like a horror, as the advert suggests, it could have been far worse, with hurtful reactions, rather than curious reactions which is what I received." Powwownow insists that the characters in its campaign are "commonplace in the world of computer games, TV, entertainment and film. "We wish to reiterate that there is absolutely no intention to offend anyone at all."

Kieran Ridley, 32,  poured petrol onto a nearby bin and lit it, the High Court in Edinburgh was told. He then left the property at Mallaig, Lochaber, having locked the front and back doors and some windows. Mr Ridley denies the charges. His lawyers argue he was not criminally responsible due to mental disorder. The court was told that 11 people were inside the property including four children between the ages of two and 16. In a statement agreed by the Crown and Mr Ridley's defence team, the court heard that Mr Ridley turned on the gas valves on the kitchen cooker  late on 27 October last year. At some point between 23:00 and 23:30 he poured petrol onto a nearby waste bin and set fire to it, causing cladding and a skirting board to catch light. He then left the house, having locked both front and rear doors and some of the windows. The trial heard that Mr Ridley, whose address was given as HMP Inverness, was detained by police later that night at Cameron Avenue, Mallaig The people in the house - called Mallaig Mhor- included his mother, brother, children aged two, eight, 15 and 16 and five other adults. The trial, before judge Craig Scott QC continues on Monday.	A man accused of attempting to murder 11 people at a remote Highland holiday home started a fire after opening gas valves on a cooker, a court has heard.
The Restore Justice campaign, spearheaded by Paul Staines who writes the Guido Fawkes political blog, calls for the death penalty to be brought back for child and police officer murderers. He cites opinion polls which suggest about half the population would like it re-introduced for murderers. This rises to 60% when it comes to child or police officer killers. Mr Staines needs 100,000 people to support his e-petition on the government website to prompt a possible parliamentary debate on the issue. The last executions in the UK took place in 1964. The death penalty was formally abolished in Britain in 1965 and in Northern Ireland in 1973. Despite it rating high on public opinion polls, it was last debated in Parliament in 1998 during the passage of the Human Rights Act. It was rejected by 158 votes. "The majority are in favour for bringing back the death penalty everywhere except in Parliament," said Mr Staines. "Politicians are complaining that there's a disconnect and that the public aren't engaged with them - maybe if they represented the views and the will of the voters, there wouldn't be such a big disconnect." He added: "The people want the death penalty, and politicians aren't prepared to vote for it. That's not right. "What I'm trying to do is get Parliament to discuss this issue between what Parliament wants and what the people want." House of Commons leader Sir George Young has warned that it would damage democracy to ignore strong opinions among members of the public "or pretend that their views do not exist". Douglas Carswell MP agreed, saying, although he was firmly against the death penalty, he was in favour of Parliament debating it and would support a referendum on whether it should be brought back. "I'm convinced that if there was a referendum on capital punishment we could win it; we could get most people to say 'no' to the death penalty. "We need to treat people as grown-ups and have the debate and not do what we have done for half a century which is to ignore the public's concern and treat them with contempt. "The important thing is we have this debate." Mr Carswell added that the reason why Parliament had not debated this topic in recent years was because it was "out of touch with the public". "The mistake MPs have made is to not trust the people and to try and ignore their concerns. We can disagree with it but we have to trust it." But Neil Durkin from Amnesty International said it was a "waste of time and money that we as a nation cannot afford". In September 2010, YouGov conducted the last opinion poll to ask directly if people want the death penalty re-instated. It suggested that 51% did. And a Mori poll in July 2010 asked people which of a list of crimes they thought should have the death penalty. For child murder, 62% supported it while a YouGov poll in November 2010 found 74% of people supported the death penalty for murder in some circumstances, though only 16% supported it for all murders. However, when similar polls were carried out in the 1970s, support for it was far higher with 70% in favour. Anthony Wells, associate director of YouGov, says polls which ask about the death penalty are straightforward: "Do you support it or not?" "When people already know about it and have established views then it is quite simple. The hard ones [opinion polls] are when people need to have an issue explained to them." He said historically opinion polls on capital punishment have been commissioned by newspapers when there has been a heinous crime such as after the Soham murders. Mr Wells added that such polls are not often commissioned in times when a high-profile murder is not in the news. However, the last two polls on the subject were not about a specific case, being conducted for a story about sentencing for murder and for a Channel 4 programme. Polls are quite accurate, plus or minus 3%, said Mr Wells, and their accuracy can be checked against real life events such as who is going to win the election or X Factor. "All the polls about the death penalty show similar patterns so even if it was worded differently it would still get the same result," he added. "You can only tell what people think at the moment, but if it follows current trends then yes, I'd expect it to go down." Mr Durkin from Amnesty International said it was important to have an informed debate, rather than a simple "yes or no" question. "Public opinion polls are usually conducted after a particularly horrible murder that's had lots of publicity so you do tend to get that outcry. "On top of that, when we have looked at opinion polls in the US, most people tend to think that the US is firmly in terms of public opinion pro death penalty. "If you offer in those questions to the public alternatives to capital punishment - the lethal injections, the electrocutions, whatever it is - and talk about longer sentences then support drops away."	An internet campaign has reignited the debate on whether the UK government should seek the reintroduction of the death penalty.
The Stanford University team said the findings were "incredibly exciting" and would now be tested in clinics. Eventually, they believe using AI could revolutionise healthcare by turning anyone's smartphone into a cancer scanner. Cancer Research UK said it could become a useful tool for doctors. The AI was repurposed from software developed by Google that had learned to spot the difference between images of cats and dogs. It was shown 129,450 photographs and told what type of skin condition it was looking at in each one. It then learned to spot the hallmarks of the most common type of skin cancer: carcinoma, and the most deadly: melanoma. Only one in 20 skin cancers are melanoma, yet the tumour accounts for three-quarters of skin cancer deaths. The experiment, detailed in the journal Nature, then tested the AI against 21 trained skin cancer doctors. One of the researchers, Dr Andre Esteva, told the BBC News website: "We find, in general, that we are on par with board-certified dermatologists." However, the computer software cannot make a full diagnosis, as this is normally confirmed with a tissue biopsy. Dr Esteva said the system now needed to be tested alongside doctors in the clinic. "The application of AI to healthcare is, we believe, an incredibly exciting area of research that can be leveraged to achieve a great deal of societal good," he said. "One particular route that we find exciting is the use of this algorithm on a mobile device, but to achieve this we would have to build an app and test its accuracy directly from a mobile device." Incredible advances in machine-learning have already led to AI beating one of humanity's best Go players. And a team of doctors in London have trained AI to predict when the heart will fail. Dr Jana Witt, from the charity Cancer Research UK, said:  "Using artificial intelligence to help diagnose skin cancer is very interesting, as it could support assessments by GPs and dermatologists. "It's unlikely that AI will replace all of the other information your clinician would consider when making a diagnosis, but AI could help guide GP referrals to specialists in the future."

Fay, 33, should win a record 185th cap when Scotland play Slovenia in their opening Euro 2017 qualifier on Tuesday. She made her debut in 1998 against the Czech Republic. "The Holland matches were the first time I really took a step back to see if it was time to stop," Fay said. Having played in eight major championship campaigns - all unsuccessful - Celtic keeper Fay had a big choice to make after Scotland lost over two legs to the Netherlands in a play-off for the World Cup in Canada. "I asked myself several questions and the desire to reach a major championship was one of them," she said. "If we qualify for Euro 2017 it will probably be the most special moment of my career." Scotland, under coach Anna Signeul, have never been given a better chance. The draw - which includes Belarus, Macedonia and top seeds Iceland - is the kindest ever. With the tournament in the Netherlands in two years time having been expanded, two teams will also qualify from most of the groups. "Externally there is an expectation on us to qualify, but you can never underestimate any team," Fay said. "We're not a team that has the arrogance to say we will definitely qualify. We are a team that says we know we have good players and we work hard in every game. "We will give every team the respect they deserve. If we do that I'm confident we will do well in this group." The Scots are based at Nova Gorica, which is almost on the Italian border, but the game is being played at Ajdovscina, some 30 minutes away. "It's a beautiful setting," said Fay of a venue which lies in a valley under towering mountains. "The pitch is a decent size for us and hopefully they will water it a bit before the game. It looks like a good place to start our campaign."	Scotland women's captain Gemma Fay admits the prospect of playing in a major championship was one of the main factors in deciding not to retire last year.
Joseph Pilates dedicated his life to refining the system of physical exercises he created whilst detained at the Knockaloe camp near Peel. Organisers said Pilates' methodology had "benefited millions worldwide". Pilates spent about three and a half years interned at the camp, which was designed to hold about 23,000 people. The Knockaloe camp was divided into 23 compounds, each designed to hold 1,020 internees. Organisers recreated that figure for the one-off 45-minute class. A spokeswoman said the class had been inspired by seeing a postcard depicting internees putting on a Pilates display, just 15 days after he arrival at the Knockloe camp. During his time in the camp it is believed the young Pilates worked in the camp's hospitals and was highly respected. He spent his time developing a comprehensive system of physical exercise which he called "Contrology". Mo Sherring, of the Isle of Man Pilates Studio, said it is "not just a series of exercises" but a "conceptual approach to movement". Pilates invented his own unique apparatus formed from the springs from his dormitory bed. He also studied the movement of animals. After the war he dedicated his life to refining his methods which are still used widely across the world.	More than 1,000 people have taken part in a Pilates class at the place where its German creator was interned on the Isle of Man in World War One.
But if ordinary Greeks retain faith in democracy - their vote is all they have left, in the considered words of one struggling cafe-owner I met in Thessaloniki - they are rapidly losing trust in Europe. For many, the EU remains a "one-way" street, as another man put it. For instance, older people used to the modernity EU membership brought back in 1981 cannot envisage ever leaving. But for some younger Greeks in Thessaloniki, capital of a region with 30% unemployment, exit is an attractive idea, or at least the abandonment of the hated euro. "You cannot put a lion and a cat in the same cage," one unemployed young man told me on the street, describing how he sees relations between Greece and the economic giants of the north. Change may take a generation if it ever happens, given the continuing support for the parties tied to the financial crisis, New Democracy and Pasok, and doubts over the willingness of the radical left in the form of Syriza to really effect change. Meanwhile there is marble-cold anger at the relentless impoverishment of a nation on the edge of Europe. Former businessman Stefanos Dimoulas now works as a pizza delivery "boy", in his words, for 3.3 euros (Â£2.7; $4.5) an hour without medical insurance. He has business debts of 50,000 euros but also, after a recent operation to remove a rare tumour in his neck, he owes 3,000 euros in medical bills. Now he needs more treatment. Mr Dimoulas did not say for whom he would vote, but expressed dismay at the way Pasok and New Democracy were ruling together after decades on opposite sides. He sees Greece's future outside the eurozone and outside the EU full stop, prospering with control over its own resources and currency. His is a positive position, imbued with love for Greece, with none of the nationalist hate associated with the far-right Golden Dawn party. I encountered some Golden Dawn supporters. Not the aggressive men I was used to seeing in TV reports, but two old-age pensioners getting drunk on spirits at a cafe table and a careworn middle-aged farmer, incensed at the low price of milk offered for his dairy herd. None of them spoke to me. It was their friends nearby who informed me of their stance. Making it my mission to interview unemployed or economically vulnerable Greeks primarily, quite at random near the cafes in Thessaloniki where they sit outside on walls or lawns because they cannot afford a simple cup of coffee anymore, I invariably met people preparing to vote for parties of the left. Again, they gave no names of parties, but there was a distaste for the traditional left and a readiness to experiment, it seemed to me, with newer parties. These include Antarsya, an anti-EU, anti-capitalist coalition created five years ago which won less than 1% of the vote at the last national election in 2012. One of its European election candidates, Foteini Rizou, I met out of the blue at a backpacker hostel, where she works as a receptionist to fund her education as an architecture student in Thessaloniki. "Pasok is no different from New Democracy," the Athenian student said. "The left should unite, but Syriza thinks staying in the EU will be good for everyone. Our view is that staying in the EU is really bad for the workers and bad for everyone in the EU." One man who really could do with some urgent change for the better is Ilias, the unemployed mathematician who gave the analogy of the lion and the cat. Unable to claim benefit, and living off his dwindling savings, the 31-year-old cannot contemplate starting a family because "without a job, you cannot get married". Emigration is not an option because he does not want to move away from his ageing parents. He would vote, he said, but about his political views, would only remark that he had never yet voted for a party that got into government. "Something must change here," he told me, shivering in the shadow of the city's Roman-era triumphal arch. "If I had the solution ready I would not be here giving you the interview. We should leave the euro. They just want to make money out of poor countries." A few hundred metres away, down on the seafront, I listened to another unemployed voter, nearly 10 years younger, staunchly anti-fascist and strongly patriotic, who expressed a harsher view. "I think the only solution is a radical one, whatever that means," George Basilos said. "We need to direct our anger at something, instead of just burning. "I think that the older generations drag us down. We are just waiting for them to die out. Some minds you cannot change." His friend, student engineer Socrates Lambadas, who does underpaid part-time work like so many other students, admires Europe for its social progress and believes Greeks are stuck in the past. "I think that many Greeks don't want to accept responsibility for the situation we're in today," he told me. "Thirty to 40 years from now, things will be better and people will not only tolerate change but look forward to it. We do have to change." For now there is continuing poverty and, in the view of Mr Dimoulas, Greece may "have still further to fall". You can also follow Patrick Jackson's reporting on jobless politics in the southern eurozone on his blog on Tumblr or get updates via Twitter.	Champions of the European Union can take heart from the fact that in urban Greece, people ground down by poverty still take the 25 May elections seriously.
That bargain could have backfired in a way that was neither good for his golf nor his social standing. Thankfully for the Spieth family, the lure of the clubs was too strong to resist. Eighteen years on, the obsessive kid has become a record-breaking champion. Ben Crenshaw, another Masters winner schooled in the high winds and heat of Texas, has spoken of looking into the 21-year-old's eyes and seeing the dead-eyed stare of Wild West gunslinger Wyatt Earp. The final day here at Augusta is often a shoot-out. The pressures of the back nine - greens like glass, fairways steep and narrow, water, water everywhere - have broken older men with far greater experience of these beautiful and brutal yards. Spieth admitted afterwards that he had struggled to sleep on Saturday night, self-effacingly pointing to his prematurely receding hairline as an indication of the stress he has been under. Yet even with so many big guns lurking - world number one Rory McIlroy, three-times Masters champion Phil Mickelson, major winner Justin Rose - the callow kid never looked like backing down. If it seemed less thrilling a finale than we have come to expect from Augusta, it is worth a reminder of the dramatic context: the second youngest winner in Masters history, the first to go to 19 under (before a bogey on the last), more birdies across his four rounds than any player here has ever made, the first man to win it wire to wire in 39 years. For those who have become desensitised to the scale of his achievement by the very fact that he had led so handsomely throughout, this might help: Rose and Mickelson's score of 14 under for second would have have been the winning tally in all bar five of the previous 78 Masters that have been played. Spieth has always been aimed at this day. He won the US Junior Amateur title twice (something only Tiger Woods had ever done before), tied for 16th in the Byron Nelson Championship as a 16-year-old (better than Woods ever managed as an amateur in a PGA Tour event) and became the youngest PGA Tour winner in 82 years when he won the John Deere Classic aged 19 years and 11 months. There is footage of him aged 14 declaring that his ultimate goal in life is to win the Masters. Goals like that are supposed to be good for young sportsmen. They also bring their own burden. Out on the course, beery breath and cigar smoke swirling in the cool breeze, there were groans and gasps when his overnight lead of four strokes was cut to three at only the second hole and again at the seventh. So locked in tradition is Augusta that no radios, phones or tablets are allowed through the gates, which preserves a certain atmosphere but also creates its own strange drama. How was Spieth doing? Was Mickelson closing, was Woods - full of promise of a charge through the front nine - rampaging along as of old? The only indication, for both players and patrons alike, is first when a volley of noise rolls in through the pine trees from a distant hole and then when the large wooden scoreboards are slowly adjusted by a troupe of men climbing up ladders, like stagehands dressing a particularly elaborate set. This sort of information vacuum frays the nerves of those watching, let alone a 21-year-old within touching distance of his greatest ambition. First a hole appears on the board next to the name of the player. Everyone turns and stares. Then, with minimal regard for the anxiety all around, an official will slowly insert a new numbered board. That was how Spieth found out that Mickelson was slipping, that McIlroy was improving too slowly, that Woods - name taken off the board entirely - was not the danger of old. Spieth would not give them a breath of hope. By the 10th - Rose three-putting the ninth - the lead was back to five. In the pine needles on 11, he bumped and ran beautifully to the right of the green before flicking on a wedge that stopped as if he had it on string. The crowds here were willing a Mickelson miracle. No-one is loved in these parts in the same way. Mickelson's avuncular grin, relaxed physique and famed generosity (few waitresses leave Phil's table less than $100 better off) have made him some sort of utopian Everyman for the American golf fan. Spieth's display rendered it instead first a procession and then a coronation. As he slipped on his first Green Jacket, with all the awkwardness that this sometimes painfully corny ceremony can offer, thoughts wandered off already to where he might go next. These debut grand triumphs are a lovely stage for a young sportsman, a point in time where everything seems possible, the future unchecked by the vagaries of injury, form or motivation. Spieth is still young enough to do exactly what his mother tells him - which is a good thing, when she spots you rather lost for words on the 18th green and tells you to congratulate your playing partner and thank the whooping crowd. It is a potent reminder of Woods at the same age, winning his debut Masters by exactly the same score and in the same nerveless fashion. It would take Woods almost two and-a-half years to win his next major. He would reach world number one rather sooner, within two months of his breakthrough at Augusta, and with Spieth already up to second in the rankings that particular piece of history may well repeat. It was easy to pick out what made the young Woods stand out - his huge driving, a power game that would cause even this living museum of golf to be radically altered. Even Spieth has trouble describing the best part of his own game, settling on the rather more prosaic "playing badly well" - what others would call course management and precocious self-control. Crenshaw, poetic in his Masters farewell, spoke of a "jeweller's touch". That does rather better in illustrating how beautifully precise Spieth was in adorning these greens with his short game. The only man who has putted like this at Augusta is Woods. Different characters in different eras, but in their graduation to the wider world with so much to share.	It began early for Jordan Spieth: when he was three years old and ready for potty-training, his mother Chris decided to bribe him out of nappies by hiding his plastic golf clubs on top of the washing machine until he had done what he had to do.
The council's cabinet had recommended changing Brecon High School to an English-medium school from 1 September. But 32 members of full council opposed the plans, with eight in favour. The vote was taken as an indication of the full council's views but it was not a final decision. That rests with the cabinet which meets on 14 March. A council report said low pupil numbers and the "need to ensure robust linguistic progression and appropriate curriculum choice for Welsh-medium pupils" were the reasons for the recommendation. The council plans to centralise Welsh-medium education for mid and south Powys in Builth Wells High School, which is a 40 mile round trip. A consultation has been carried out on the plans, with staff, parents and pupils raising a number of concerns. Among them were pupils missing out on extra-curricular activities, such as after school clubs and music lessons, due to having to travel to Builth Wells for Welsh-medium education.	A majority of councillors voted in favour of retaining a Welsh-medium stream at a Powys school on Tuesday.
Julie Sayles, 59, of Sewerby Road, Bridlington is alleged to have persuaded Edith Negus to change her will to benefit her. She also bought two houses with money she allegedly took from a joint bank account she shared with Mrs Negus. Ms Sayles, who worked for an elderly-care charity, denies fraud charges. More on this and other East Yorkshire stories At Hull Crown Court Ms Sayles described herself "as a woman of faith". She said she became close to Mrs Negus after she started taking her for days out and church visits and said Mrs Negus was not getting any support from her family. Ms Sayles said Mrs Negus had known exactly what she wanted to do with her money and that she "had repeatedly said that she wanted me to have that money". Prosecutor Robert Stevenson accused Ms Sayles of "being a liar" and said she was taking advantage of the fact Mrs Negus was no longer here. Mr Stevenson then asked Ms Sayles why she did not inform Mrs Negus's family about the will change. He said that if she had contacted the family "her game would've been up." Ms Sayles denied the accusation and said that the family had the opportunity to discuss it with Ms Negus and contacting them would have meant she would "have lost her friendship with Edith". Ms Sayles is accused of fraud by abuse of position, buying properties with the proceeds of crime, making a fraudulent will and presenting it to a solicitor. The trial continues.	A carer accused of stealing almost £290,000 from a 102-year-old said the woman "wanted her to have the money", a court has heard.
Media playback is not supported on this device Amy Wilson Hardy went over in the corner as England scored from their only chance in the first half. Ireland could not breach England's solid defence and were made to pay as the world champions ran in four tries. Forwards Laura Keates and Amy Cokayne extended the visitors' lead before backs Emily Scarratt and Lydia Thompson rounded off the win with fine tries. With the under-20 men's side having won a Grand Slam earlier on Friday, England's men will look to complete a hat-trick by beating Ireland in Dublin on Saturday. The women, who return to Ireland in the summer to defend their world title, have won their first Six Nations title since 2012. Wing Wilson Hardy completed a fine England move in the 16th minute, but then Ireland dominated play. Centre Sene Naoupu came within a metre of going over but was stopped by a superb tackle from flanker Marlie Packer, and home captain Paula Fitzpatrick was prevented from touching down by a posse of England players. England regrouped after half-time and extended their lead when replacement prop Keates drove over the line from two metres out. Ireland were reduced to 14 players two minutes before the hour when substitute Mairead Coyne made a deliberate knock-on. Hooker Cokayne burst through to increase England's advantage but Ireland hooker Leah Lyons responded to give Ireland hope. However, Scarratt finished off an excellent England move to put the result beyond doubt and then replacement winger Thompson showed her pace to score England's fifth try. Ireland: Flood, Tyrrell, Murphy, Naoupu, Miller, Stapleton, Muldoon; Peat, Lyons, Egan, Spence, Reilly, Griffin, Molloy, Fitzpatrick (capt).

Two other children, aged 10 and seven, suffered minor injuries in the crash, in Ballards Road, off Church Lane, in Dagenham at 15:50 BST on Friday. The 22-year-old motorcyclist  was taken to hospital where he later died. Police said a KTM motorcycle was involved in a collision with a Vauxhall Zafira car. The 38-year-old male driver of the car was not injured. A post-mortem examination is due to be carried out. The boy, who was a rear passenger in the car, was taken to an east London hospital where he remains in a serious condition. No arrests have been made and police are appealing for witnesses. Anyone with information is asked to call the Serious Collision Investigation Unit based at Chadwell Heath.	A motorcyclist died and a five-year-old boy was left in a serious condition in a crash in east London.
These are the close-up views provided by academics from Mosul, who have maintained covert contacts linking the city with the outside world. They claim that foreign fighters, once visible in Mosul, have disappeared from the city. "The frontline foreign fighters are rarely there. They've vanished. The houses they occupied are vacant," said one source, speaking anonymously. "They're leaving it to the local fighters, who will become the scapegoats." The IS leadership in the city is also described as "melting away". "It's a lost cause. It's the end of days for them," says one of the scholars from Mosul, who have been supported by the New York-based Institute of International Education, which once rescued academics in Europe from the Nazis. They also talk of "changed tactics", with IS fighters trimming their beards and changing the way they dress to look more like the civilian population - with Mosul residents assuming this is to make them less distinguishable if the city is overrun. Cars in the city have been forced to switch to Islamic State number plates, says one of the academics. The fear from civilians is that this could make all cars vulnerable to an air strike or put them at risk of being attacked in the battle for the city. So far, air strikes have been carefully targeted at government buildings and military sites, according to this view from the city. Another says that this accuracy might seem "impossible" but so far the attacks have been on "confirmed" targets. Mosul University, once one of the biggest universities in the Middle East, had been kept open by the IS authorities when they seized the city in 2014. It had raised questions about whether its laboratories were being used to develop weapons, including for chemical warfare, which could be used in battle or against civilians. But sources now say that this is "no longer an issue" as the university has been pulverised by air strikes. "The university is completely inoperative and air strikes have made it a difficult place to go. Most of the buildings have been brought down, it's virtually gone. The laboratories are destroyed." It is expected there will be "chlorine rockets", but doubts about anything more sophisticated. Another source says that "Daesh used the university to store some weapons" and had blocked access to some sections of laboratories. "It is believed that they used laboratories for terrorist purposes, but it is almost impossible to confirm such claims." But it's assumed that the laboratories would have had chemicals - and that the IS forces might have carried out experiments, such as adding chemicals to explosives. But the destruction of the university is claimed to have stopped any further weapons development. Although there is a claim that "Daesh insurgents are still inside the university to 'protect' it from any emergency situation". As the Iraqi government forces, militias and Kurdish Peshmerga close in on the city, there are signs of deepening tensions between the IS regime and the local population, according to sources. The city's people are said to be in a "state of fear and terror". As IS has been targeted by the coalition forces, they in turn have "put their anger on the people" claiming that Mosul's residents are communicating with "hostile parties to Daesh". At Friday prayers last week, a pro-IS preacher talked of how local people were "hypocrites" who had let down the "caliphate". The religious police are also trying to assert their authority and show that nothing has changed in their control - and there have been more gruesome public executions of people claimed to be opponents or informants. "They are trying to show they are in control of everything." There is a culture of "false accusations" and another Mosul academic says: "Daesh continues to hunt 'offenders' and punish them heavily," which often means the death penalty. The IS authorities have tried to clamp down on communications - but this doesn't seem to be effective. There had been highly-monitored public points for internet access, but these too have been shut down. But as the Iraqi forces advance on the city, internet providers have been boosting access in Mosul. It means that in some parts of the city it has been possible to make contact, but this is being carried out in elaborate and extremely cautious ways to keep such links secret. Such communication is described as being immensely dangerous, but there is a great hunger for news. A source says there is a "great risk of punishment", which would be execution. There is said to be a huge amount of excitement about the approaching forces. "People in Mosul are jubilant at the prospect of the city being liberated," says another local source. This optimism, at the early stages of the battle, is said to outweigh fears of the loss of civilian lives and the destruction of buildings. Tactics being used by the IS forces, such as digging tunnels, are seen as likely to be ineffective - and there is an expectation that they will be defeated. Then there will be questions about reconstruction and rebuilding - and there are questions about whether professionals who have fled the city will really want to come back. There are deep concerns about how the battle for Mosul might become a proxy for other sectarian disputes and score-settling, with so many opposing forces under the banner of the coalition attacking IS. There are also fears that politicians, with their own militias, could exploit the battle for their own advantage. Arguments also exist that this is a city exhausted by bloodshed and desperate for peace and moderation. For two years of the IS occupation and for a decade before, there has been so much conflict, destruction and extremism. Mosul has been "saturated with violence" and this long "trauma" must end.	The forces of so-called Islamic State, now besieged in Mosul, are in a state of "frenzy" inside the city, increasingly blaming and terrorising the local population and preparing to conceal themselves if defeated.
Cornish-born Glover was meant to be back with  winning partner Heather Stanning, but Glover, 27, won the  with Swann last season. "We had a whole year together last year so hopefully it'll click into place," she told BBC Radio Cornwall. "It's clicking into place fairly easily, we just need to get back onto the same page technically and get doing the same things." Swann replaced Stanning last season after she Glover and Swann won three World Cup events together last season as well as the world title in South Korea. And with a good performance in Amsterdam, Glover says there could be some tough decisions for the Great Britain selectors as to who partners her in the coxless pair for the rest of this season. She said: "It's going to be a quite interesting one with Heather coming back after taking a year out with the army and Polly staying here. "There's lots of selection things about who will be in the pair out of those two. "But I want to keep my eye on the World Championships at the end of August in Amsterdam. "It'd be great to try and hold on to our world champion title, whoever else is in the boat with me."	Helen Glover expects her partnership with Polly Swann to develop quickly as they prepare for the European Championships in Belgrade.
Police now believe that the 26-year-old man from Rochdale took a crystallised and unrefined version of the drug Spice. Ch Supt Neil Evans, described the development as "extremely worrying". Ten people were admitted to hospital after taking the drug over the weekend, with four kept in intensive care. A police spokesman said they were hospitalised after taking what was thought to be a new form of MDMA, known as "pink champagne". But he added: "It is now believed that this substance was in fact a synthetic cannabinoid, like 'Spice', however it was sold as MDMA." Ch Supt Neil Evans said: "This is the first time we have seen 'Spice' in crystallised, and much more potent and unrefined form and it's now being mistakenly taken as MDMA." He added: "Anyone thinking of taking MDMA must seriously consider what they are doing. "You may feel that you know and accept the risks of taking MDMA, but you never know what you are actually taking and the reaction your body could have to it." A 26-year-old man, held on suspicion of supplying Class A drugs, was released while inquiries continue.	A man thought to have been killed by the drug MDMA had taken a "much more potent version" of Spice, Greater Manchester Police has said.
The LottoNL-Jumbo rider triumphed in a sprint ahead of Australia's Caleb Ewan, with Briton Chris Opie third. That came after several riders fell heavily in a dramatic crash in the final metres in Scarborough. Britain's Adam Blythe also finished in the top 10, placing eighth on the 173km run from Bridlington, the first of three stages. Groenewegen also took narrow victory ahead of Ewan in the opening stage of the 2016 event, eventually won by Thomas Voeckler, who is defending his title this year. "The last climb was hard but the team brought me back into position so I could sprint for the win. It's a beautiful race with a lot of people on the road, that gives you a lot of motivation," he told ITV. "Today was one chance and tomorrow is another but we'll see." Saturday's second stage will start on the bridge in Tadcaster that has been rebuilt after being damaged by floods, and is expected to end in a bunch sprint in Harrogate. Sunday's finale is a gruelling 194.5km ride from Bradford to Sheffield which takes in eight King of the Mountain climbs, including the Cote de Silsden and the cobbles of Haworth's main street, with four ascents saved for a final 22km circuit. The women's race, featuring Britain's former world champion Lizzie Deignan, takes place over the same 122.5km route earlier in the day. The Tour de Yorkshire, now in its third year, began as part of the legacy of the county hosting the 2014 Grand Depart for the Tour de France. Overall classification after stage one: 1. Dylan Groenewegen (Ned/LottoNl-Jumbo) 4hrs 09mins 28secs 2. Caleb Ewan (Aus/Orica-Scott) +4secs 3. Chris Opie (GB/Bike Channel Canyon) +6secs 4. Angel Madrazo (Spa/Delko) +8secs 5.

The west African nation branded the 54-member grouping, which includes the UK and most of its former colonies, a "neo-colonial institution". The withdrawal was announced on state TV but no other reasons were given. Two years ago President Yahya Jammeh accused the UK of backing his political opposition ahead of elections. Commonwealth officials said they only heard about the move through the media and had not yet been contacted by The Gambia. A spokesman said Secretary-General Kamalesh Sharma had seen the reports with "dismay and disappointment" and had asked for "clarification" from the country. There is a history of tension between President Jammeh, who came to power in a 1994 coup, and the UK. Earlier this year, a Foreign Office report singled out The Gambia for its human rights record, citing cases of unlawful detentions, illegal closures of newspapers and discrimination against minority groups. On Thursday a Foreign Office spokesman said: "Decisions on Commonwealth membership are a matter for each member government. We would very much regret Gambia, or any other country, deciding to leave the Commonwealth." In August last year The Gambia was criticised by Amnesty International and others for executing nine prisoners by firing squad. The Commonwealth was founded in 1931 but acquired its modern shape after 1949 as former British colonies and protectorates, including The Gambia, started to achieve self-government and varying degrees of independence. According to the Commonwealth's charter, member states should communicate and co-operate "in the common interests of our peoples and in the promotion of international understanding and world peace". In its statement, The Gambian government said it had "withdrawn its membership of the British Commonwealth". It said it had "decided that The Gambia will never be a member of any neo-colonial institution and will never be a party to any institution that represents an extension of colonialism". But Bakary Dabo, former vice president of The Gambia and chairman of the country's campaign for democratic change, said people there are generally "very happy" to be part of the Commonwealth. He said the government had recently begun "picking up war against poorly specified enemies called 'western powers'". Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Dabo said this rhetoric had "accelerated" in recent years and been used when President Jammeh gave a "rambling" speech at the United Nations General Assembly last month Also at the UN, President Jammeh said homosexuality was one of the three "biggest threats to human existence". He has also drawn international criticism for claiming he can cure Aids with a herbal body rub and bananas. BBC Africa analyst Farouk Chothia said despite its image as an idyllic holiday destination, The Gambia, and its population of less than two million, were kept under tight control by its eccentric leader. The latest decision was bound to come from him, our analyst added. The Royal Commonwealth Society, an education charity which works in Commonwealth countries, said The Gambia's announcement was unexpected and appeared to be undemocratic. Society director Michael Lake said President Jammeh had made the decision "without consulting The Gambia's people" and the country's withdrawal would be "a loss felt by both its people and the wider Commonwealth network". He added: "Far from being a 'neo-colonial institution', the modern Commonwealth operates on a consensus model and its voluntary membership is predicated primarily on a country's commitment to upholding shared values and principles." The last time a nation left the Commonwealth was in 2003, when Zimbabwe withdrew. The Queen, who is 87, is the head of the Commonwealth, which holds its next heads of government meeting in Colombo, Sri Lanka, next month. However, the gathering will be the first that the Queen has not attended since 1971. She will send her son, the Prince of Wales instead. Buckingham Palace said she would make fewer overseas trips because of her age. Three African countries have joined the Commonwealth in recent years. Rwanda was admitted in 2009 after applying for membership the previous year, while Cameroon and Mozambique became members in 1995.	The Gambia's decision to withdraw from the Commonwealth 48 years after joining is something to "very much regret", the UK Foreign Office has said.
CIA code that obscures malware's origins was detailed in the latest release by the whistle-blowing site. The code could be used to create a "signature" for CIA malware, said one virus hunter. The information is part of a larger cache about CIA hacking tools that started to be released last month. The release of the information could be "one of the most technically damaging" said Nicholas Weaver, a computer security researcher at the University of California in Berkeley, in an interview with the Washington Post. "It seems designed to directly disrupt ongoing CIA operations and attribute previous operations," he said. Before now, the information released about the CIA's hacking tools by Wikileaks has largely been only text describing many different ways the agency spies on targets. The latest release differs as it involves actual code used to hide the ultimate origins of malware used by the US organisation. It shows the obfuscation techniques used to make it harder to reverse engineer malware to unmask who made it. Included in the code library are fragments of Chinese and Farsi that are intended to be used in malware, as well as methods of moving data around that seek to thwart tools examining whether different samples have anything in common. Jake Williams, founder of security firm Rendition InfoSec, said the release was "significant". "It allows the attribution of previously discovered malware to the CIA specifically," he wrote, adding that the code samples could add up to a signature for spotting agency work. "It is likely that malware has been discovered previously which was not attributed to CIA then, but can be today thanks to the release of the code," he said. The CIA would not comment on the authenticity of the information released by Wikileaks, but a spokesman said Americans should be "deeply troubled" by the organisation's actions. "Dictators and terrorists have no better friend in the world than Julian Assange, as theirs is the only privacy he protects," said the spokesman.	Current spying campaigns run by the CIA could be disrupted, say experts, after more data on the agency's hacking techniques was released by Wikileaks.
The US economy grew at an annual rate of 0.2% in the first three months of the year, far lower than forecasts. The Federal Reserve also kept interest rates at a record low, blaming the slower growth on "transitory factors". Japan's Nikkei 225 was down 2.7% to 19,520.21, its biggest loss in nearly four months. The market extended losses after Bank of Japan left its monetary policy unchanged, while lacklustre company earnings also had their impact on the benchmark index. Shares in Honda fell 6.7% after it announced a fall in profit for the fiscal year to March, as it deals with recalls following exploding air-bags. Drug maker Takeda shares fell 3% after it warned it would make a loss because of a $2.4bn US legal settlement linked to its Actos diabetes drug. Chinese shares headed lower with Hong Kong's Hang Seng index falling 0.9% to 28,157.71, while the Shanghai Composite was 0.6% lower at 4,449.17. Shares of AAC Technologies in Hong Kong fell 5.2% after a report in the Wall Street Journal that the Apple Watch had defective component, which was supplied by the Chinese company. In Australia, the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 ended down 0.8% at 5,790. South Korea's benchmark Kospi index closed down 0.7% at 2,127.17 - marking its fifth consecutive day of losses. Government data showed that the country's industrial output fell by a seasonally adjusted 0.4% in March from February - missing market expectations.	Asian markets traded lower on Thursday with investor sentiment dented by a weaker than expected first quarter growth figure in the US.
Wilder's side were confirmed champions after rivals Oxford lost to Luton Town. "He's a very down to earth guy, he's a motivator and certainly gets us going for games," said Richards. "That hour before the game after we've warmed up he's certainly getting in each other's ears. It's loud in the dressing room, put it that way." Richards continued to BBC Radio Northampton: "But you can go to him and speak to him, anything about football or outside football. He's been first class for all the players this season." In November, the club owed repayments on a £10.25m loan to the local borough council, while they faced a winding-up petition from HM Revenue & Customs and the club's bank account was frozen. However, after a takeover from Kelvin Thomas changed the fortunes of the club off the pitch and Wilder and his team continued their fine form to win 10 matches in a row, and they are currently on a 20-game unbeaten run. Richards himself, though, has missed the run-in because of an Achilles injury, which needed an operation. "I've had a tendon taken out of each Achilles, apparently you don't need them, and I've had a scrape on my Achilles to take away the scar tissue," said the 33-year-old. "It'll be another week on my crutches, I should be back jogging within five weeks and then a week before pre-season starts I should be back to full fitness. "The idea behind getting the operation done now was to make sure I was ready for next season. Maybe I could have battled on through the last few games, but I wouldn't have done myself or the club justice."	Northampton Town striker Marc Richards has praised "first-class" manager Chris Wilder after the Cobblers won the League Two title.
Female officers will be able to wear a headscarf under their caps or berets, provided it is plain and is the same colour as the uniform. Headscarf bans on university campuses and state institutions - except for the judiciary, military and police - have also been lifted in recent years. The garment has been controversial in Turkey for years. Secularists regard it as a symbol of religious conservatism. Since the 1920s, Turkey has had a secular constitution with no state religion. The opposition have accused President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his Islamist-rooted Justice and Development Party (AKP) of trying to reinterpret secularism. However, public debate has also evolved to accept the hijab as an expression of individual liberties, correspondents say. No strong opposition has been voiced against this latest move. President Erdogan has long embraced Turks' right to express their religious beliefs openly, but he says he is committed to secularism. In 2010, the country's universities abandoned an official ban on Muslim headscarves. Three years later, women were allowed to wear headscarves in state institutions - with the exception of the judiciary, military and police. That year, four MPs wore headscarves in parliament. Most people in Turkey are Sunni Muslims.	Turkey has lifted a ban on policewomen wearing the Islamic headscarf.
Ex-Bank of England deputy governor Sir Charlie Bean is reviewing how official statistics are collected, and his initial findings are due on Wednesday. The PCS union said it would "strongly oppose" transferring work or jobs from Newport, where 2,000 staff are based The ONS said it was not "helpful" to speculate on the report's findings. The ONS transferred hundreds of jobs from London to Newport in the late 2000s. PCS union representative Gez Kirby said: "There's some anxiety obviously." He told the BBC's Sunday Politics Wales programme: "We believe we produce high quality economic statistics and we don't want to see any of our work or our jobs move out of Newport." Mr Kirby added: "We welcome any recommendation coming from the Bean Review, to increase the economic expertise in London, because they can liaise with the Treasury, the Bank of England, that makes sense. "We would not welcome, and we would strongly oppose any proposal to transfer work or jobs from Newport." Sir Charlie has previously said the ONS is "maybe not quite such a strong performer" as it once was. However, more recently, he also said Newport could become a centre of expertise in the field of statistics. An ONS spokesperson said: "ONS has welcomed the Bean Review as a good opportunity to review our systems and processes for measuring the changing UK economy." "As the interim report of the review is due to be published shortly, it would not be helpful to speculate about its content. "We look forward to reading its recommendations when it is published." Sunday Politics Wales can be seen on BBC One Wales at 11:00 GMT on 29 November.	Office for National Statistics (ONS) staff in Newport are anxious that a government review will lead to jobs leaving south Wales, a union has said.
The typical home in the East increased in cost by 8.3% in the year to the end of July, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. Prices in London, which saw big rises last year, rose by 5.5%, slightly lower than the average in England of 5.6%. Overall, UK house prices increased by 5.2% in the year to the end of July. The other area to see significant price growth was Northern Ireland, up 7.4%. Property values in Northern Ireland are recovering from a massive fall during the financial crisis, and remain 42% below the peak of August 2007, the ONS figures show, Prices rose by 6.7% in the South East of England, the ONS figures show, although here - as in the East and in seven other regions - the pace of price rises has slowed. Analysts suggest that the time of double-digit price rises in London is over for now. "There is very much a ripple effect - the action has moved out from prime central London to the outskirts and those commuter areas where there is better value to be had, although not as much if prices continue to rise as they have been," said Jonathan Adams, director of central London estate agency Napier Watt. The 5.2% average price increase in the UK was down from the 5.7% rate recorded in the previous month. Prices in Scotland fell by 1.3% and were 0.7% lower in the North East of England. Excluding London and the South East of England, UK house prices increased by 4.4%. The average home cost £295,000 in England, £173,000 in Wales, £154,000 in Northern Ireland and £196,000 in Scotland. In England, the highest average price was paid in London (£525,000) and the lowest in the North East (£156,000). The average price paid in the UK was £282,000, and analysts expect this to continue to rise, not least as a result of a lack of properties in the market. Writing in the Guardian, Neal Hudson, a housing market analyst for Savills, said that the cost of buying a property, rather than the cost of owning it, is the biggest barrier to people buying their first home. That is because a large amount is needed for a deposit, while mortgage costs are well below the norm. Figures from the Council of Mortgage Lenders show that the number of homeowners remortgaging - in order to take advantage of low rates - rose by 26% in July compared with the same month a year earlier.	House prices are rising fastest in the East of England, official figures show, as analysts suggest property market "action" has moved out of London.
Dr Sarandev Bhambra was singled out by Zack Davies who was heard saying "white power" during the machete attack at the store in Mold, Flintshire, in January. An ex-soldier rescued the victim. Davies, 26, of Mold, was convicted of attempted murder at the town's crown court in June and on Friday was told he must serve at least 14 years in prison. Judge Rhys Rowlands said Davies had developed "extreme racist views" and had been plotting to carry out a "murderous attack" in order to draw attention to himself. He said it was a "planned and racially motivated attack", as Dr Bhambra watched proceedings during his first appearance at the court in Mold. Speaking outside court, the victim said Davies was a "coward". "He attacked me from behind and tried to behead me," Dr Bhambra said. "By the grace of God I remained conscious and was able to defend myself. "It is abhorrent that he has claimed that he tried to kill me in Lee Rigby's honour." During the trial, the court heard Dr Bhambra had been walking down an aisle in the store on 14 January when he felt a "huge blow" to the back of his head from the 30cm (12in) machete. Shopper Leanne Jones said she heard the words "white power" and that Davies was acting "like a lunatic" as he hacked Dr Bhambra with the machete. Another witness heard Davies say: "Come here, this is for Lee Rigby". The attack left Dr Bhambra, a 25-year-old dentist from Leeds, with two deep cuts to his scalp and another to his back, which went down to the muscle. An injury to his left hand caused major nerve, artery and tendon damage, leaving him in need of surgery for five hours. If it was not for the "remarkably brave actions" of soldier Peter Fuller, who came to his defence, Dr Bhambra would have been "killed in front of many shoppers", Judge Rowlands said. The trial heard items associated with white supremacy and Nazism were found at Davies's home, including banners, swastika badges and Combat 18 stickers. He also said he was "absolutely fascinated" with Islamic State and described the British man known as Jihadi John as his inspiration. Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale were jailed for life in February 2014 for hacking Fusilier Rigby to death. After the trial concluded, Dr Bhambra's brother, Dr Tarlochan Singh Bhambra, said his family had "no doubt" that, had the "racial disposition" of the case been reversed, it would have been reported as an "act of terror". Det Ch Insp Alun Oldfield from North Wales Police said: "This was a horrific attack and we are pleased with the sentence given to Davies. "North Wales Police would like to commend the character and determination of Dr Bhambra and we are delighted that he is making such a good recovery. "We also applaud the actions of Mr Peter Fuller, who has since been nominated for a national bravery award."	A neo-Nazi has been jailed for life for attempting to behead a Tesco shopper in a racially-motivated revenge attack for the murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby.
The ruling is likely to encourage thousands of passengers with similar claims in the UK. Jet2 argued the compensation payments should be delayed pending the outcome of a similar case in the Netherlands. But the judge at Liverpool County Court ruled that "a line should now be drawn. Justice delayed is justice denied". The EU has ruled that airlines must pay compensation for delayed flights, but a number of airlines have yet to pay out. Four airlines in the UK have made applications to delay payments: Jet2, Thomas Cook, Ryanair and WizzAir. The Jet2 case heard in Liverpool involved Kim Allen, who claimed â‚¬400 (Â£292) compensation after an almost seven-hour delay when flying from Manchester to Malaga in 2012. "We've all been kept waiting for so long, but I'm really happy with today's decision," she said after the judge's ruling. "Hopefully now it's time for the airlines to pay us what the law says they should." Her solicitor, Kevin Clarke from Bott & Co, said he hoped "the airlines will now finally face up to their obligations to passengers and to settle the hundreds of thousands of legitimate claims outstanding. "Sadly, the history of their conduct over the last decade would tell us to expect yet another legal challenge." The issue stems from the 2004 European regulations that oblige airlines, in some cases, to pay compensation to passengers for cancellations and delays, if they are not due to extraordinary circumstances. A further ruling by the European Court of Justice in 2009 confirmed that delayed passengers should be treated as if their flights had been cancelled, if the delay was longer than three hours, entitling them to cash compensation. Despite the ruling, a number of airlines in the UK are still arguing that some technical problems should be classified as extraordinary circumstances, and as such, no compensation should be due. They have also argued that paying compensation for delays of three hours or more is disproportionate and too great a burden.	A county court judge has ruled that airline Jet2.com cannot delay the payment of compensation due to passengers for delayed flights.
Bristol's Lee Haskins defends his IBF world bantamweight title against Ivan Morales at Cardiff's new Ice Arena. Selby, 27, is brother of current World IBF Featherweight champion Lee Selby. Andrew Selby made a dazzling start to his professional career, beating Tanzanian Haji Juma in Newport on October, 2015. Leicestershire's Norman, 22, has been beaten once in 13 bouts.	The British Boxing Board of Control has sanctioned Andrew Selby to fight Louis Norman for the vacant British flyweight title on 14 May in Cardiff.
Former baseball player Mike Piazza and businessman Giuseppe Corrado have both ended their interest in the bankrupt club, and no other offers were made before Monday's deadline. Parma, who were relegated from Serie A, cannot now register for Serie B. The club won the Uefa Cup twice and the Cup Winners' Cup once during the 1990s. The northern Italy side also won two of their three Italian Cups in the decade, and were Serie A runners-up in the 1996-97 season. Parma's total debts are nearly 75m euros (£54m), but in order to register for Serie B they needed to clear their sporting debt - money owed to players and staff.	Parma are set to begin next season as an amateur club in Italy's fourth tier after failing to find a buyer to pay off a debt of 22.6m euros (£16.2m).
Bricks were thrown and fires lit outside Stratford bus station and Forest Gate police station in London. Protesters allege Edir Frederico Da Costa, 25, was "brutally beaten" by Met Police officers earlier this month. The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) is investigating the treatment of Mr Da Costa, who died six days after he was stopped by police. Borough Commander Supt Ian Larnder stood in the middle of a group of protesters trying to answer their questions and calm tensions. One protester rode his motorbike up to the police line and revved his engine in front of officers. Another motorcyclist turned his bike towards the officers and span his wheels so smoke blew towards them. Firefighters, protected by police, hosed out a fire which had been started in a bin in Richmond Road. Bins were also set alight near a McDonald's in Romford Road. Bricks had been ripped from a wall and thrown at police. Family campaigners said the violence was not coming from them and it had been set up as a peaceful march. The police said there had been no arrests but some officers suffered minor injuries. The force added that the number of protesters was starting to dwindle just before 23:00. Mr Da Costa, known by friends as Edson, died on 21 June, six days after being stopped in a car in Woodcocks, Beckton, in Newham, east London. Campaigners claim that his neck was broken and he suffered head and other injuries after he was stopped in a car, containing three people, by Met officers. The IPCC said a preliminary post-mortem examination, carried out on Thursday, indicated there were no spinal injuries caused by police. Transport for London said that from just before 18:00 there had been "a number of bus diversions at police request" due to the demonstration at Stratford.	Protesters have faced off with police in a demonstration over the death of a man after a traffic stop.
"In full co-ordination with the government of Iraq, we're deploying a specialised expeditionary targeting force to assist Iraqi and Kurdish Peshmerga forces," Mr Carter said. The operators would carry out raids, free hostages and capture IS leaders. They would also conduct "unilateral operations" in Syria, he said. Islamic State conquered large swathes of Iraq and Syria in the summer of 2014. A US-led coalition of 65 countries is conducting a campaign against the militants in both countries. Mr Carter made the announcement in remarks to the House Armed Services Committee in Washington on Tuesday. He did not offer specifics on troop numbers, but said they would also be focused on securing Iraq's borders and building the capacity of the Iraqi government forces. US special forces have already conducted operations in both Syria and Iraq - notably the killing of the IS oil chief Abu Sayaff in eastern Syria and the freeing of prisoners from the IS-held town of Hawija near Kirkuk in Iraq. But this is a clear indication from the Pentagon that their role will become more significant. The "specialised expeditionary targeting force", as the Iraq group is being called, will not only assist local forces but will also conduct further "unilateral" raids into Syria. While this does not amount to significant numbers of boots on the ground, it is an escalation of America's role in direct combat. Mr Carter said there was now an important opportunity to divide IS militants in Iraq from those in Syria. In October, the US announced it would send up to 50 special forces soldiers to northern Syria as military advisers to Kurdish and rebel forces.	The US is to deploy a specialised force to Iraq to build pressure on Islamic State militants, US Defence Secretary Ashton Carter has said.
The repeal bill, published earlier, is also facing opposition from Labour and other parties in the Commons. Ministers are "optimistic" about getting it through and have promised an "ongoing intense dialogue" with the devolved administrations. No 10 said it had to be passed or "there will be no laws" after Brexit. Brexit Secretary David Davis called it "one of the most significant pieces of legislation that has ever passed through Parliament". He rejected claims ministers were giving themselves "sweeping powers" to make changes to laws as they are repatriated. It will be up to MPs if they want a say on the "technical changes" ministers plan to make to legislation, he told the BBC. Labour says it will not support the bill in its current form and is demanding concessions in six areas, including the incorporation of the European Charter of Fundamental Rights into British law. The party wants guarantees workers' rights will be protected and also want curbs on the power of government ministers to alter legislation without full parliamentary scrutiny. Leader Jeremy Corbyn, who was in Brussels earlier for a meeting with the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier, said: "Far too much of it seems to be a process where the government... will be able to bypass Parliament. "We will make sure there is full parliamentary scrutiny. We have a Parliament where the government doesn't have a majority, we have a country which voted in two ways on Leave or Remain. "The majority voted to leave and we respect that, but they didn't vote to lose jobs and they didn't vote to have Parliament ridden roughshod over." The Conservatives are relying on Democratic Unionist Party support to win key votes after losing their Commons majority in the general election, but could face a revolt from Remain supporting backbenchers. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said there could be "parliamentary guerrilla warfare" on the bill, as opposition parties and "Remainer Tories" try to "put their version of Brexit, not Theresa May's, on to the statute book". The repeal bill is not expected to be debated by MPs until the Autumn, but will need to have been passed by the time the UK leaves the EU - which is due to happen in March 2019. But the Scottish and Welsh governments have to give "legislative consent" to the bill before it can become law - something they have said they are not willing to do. In a joint statement, first ministers Nicola Sturgeon and Carwyn Jones, who also met Mr Barnier, described the bill as a "naked power-grab" by Westminster that undermined the principles of devolution. They say the bill returns powers from Brussels solely to the UK government and Parliament and "imposes new restrictions" on the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly. Ministers at Holyrood will not be able to amend EU rules in devolved areas such as agriculture and fisheries after Brexit until the UK Parliament and Scottish government have reached an agreement on them. UK Scottish Secretary David Mundell claimed the repeal bill would result in a powers "bonanza" for Holyrood - a comment described as "ludicrous" by the SNP. Theresa May's official spokeswoman said the repeal bill was a "hugely important piece of legislation" because "we need to have a functioning statute book on the day we leave the EU". The spokesman said First Secretary of State Damian Green had contacted the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and the government was confident of gaining their consent. Asked if there was a contingency plan if he didn't win their backing, the prime minister's official spokesman said "not that I'm aware of". Lib Dem leader Tim Farron, whose party is seeking to join forces with Labour and Tory rebels, said he was "putting the government on warning", promising a tougher test than than it faced when passing legislation authorising the UK's departure from the EU. "If you found the Article 50 Bill difficult, you should be under no illusion, this will be hell," he said. Steve Baker, a minister in the Department for Exiting the European Union, said the government was "ready" for a fight over the bill but would also to "listen to Parliament". Speaking to BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg, Mr Davies predicted the bill "may get amendments here and there", saying he was open to suggestions from other parties for things that should be included. "If we've missed something and got something wrong, then we'll debate that in the House of Commons," he said. "That's how this works." Mr Davis also insisted contingency plans were being made in case the UK and the EU cannot agree a Brexit deal. "We are planning for all options," he said. "The ideal outcome... right through to it not working at all and not getting a negotiated outcome at all." Asked why Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson had said the government had "no plan" for such a scenario, he said: "That's possibly because it's my responsibility to plan for it."	The Scottish and Welsh governments have threatened to block the key Brexit bill which will convert all existing EU laws into UK law.
Inspectors reported a "marked increase" at HMP Risley near Warrington, Cheshire since its last inspection, some of which may not have been "justified". The report also said new psychoactive substances (NPS) were "undermining prisoner well-being" and a fifth of inmates felt conditions were "unsafe". Chief Inspector of Prisons Peter Clarke said the findings were "disappointing". The report by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Prisons followed an unannounced inspection of the jail - which houses 1,115 male prisoners - in June. While the prison had "a similar variable picture" to its last inspection in 2013, there was "some deterioration", Mr Clarke noted. An inspection in 2011 also found the use of force in some incidents at the jail was "unjustified". Mr Clarke said the high number of prisoners feeling unsafe was "worse than comparable prisons", though levels of violence were similar. He added that while "some meaningful work was being done" to deal with the "serious destabilising" issue of NPS, commonly known as legal highs, "nearly two-thirds of prisoners thought it was easy to obtain drugs". Risley "was not a sufficiently respectful prison", he said. He added accommodation standards "varied greatly" and there was a "need for more hygienic conditions and improved provision of basic amenities". The prison "did not have a grasp of the resettlement needs of the population, which was a fundamental failing for a resettlement prison," he said. "Only 40% of prisoners indicated they thought their time at Risley had made them less likely to offend. "The prison needs to go back to first principles in determining how best it can assess and resettle its prisoners." Michael Spurr, chief executive of the National Offender Management Service, said he hoped the jail's new governor would "develop the regime" at Risley. "The previous governor and his staff have worked hard to improve safety, to tackle illicit psychoactive drugs and to provide support for vulnerable prisoners, but there is more to do. "The new governor comes with an impressive track record and will build on the work of her predecessor."	A prison has seen a fourfold increase in the use of force by officers against inmates since 2013, a report has found.
And even one of those three times  - when it bought 250 million chocolate selection boxes from Woolworths following its  collapse - was a deliberate ploy to attract the retailer's customers to its stores. It's a story that reflects just how Poundland, despite the cheap and cheerful image,  is a tightly managed business. Poundland might look a bit basic - the ultimate in pile-it-high, sell-it-cheap - but this is a sophisticated firm with big plans for expansion. And its growth is part of a wider UK success story: the unstoppable rise of the discount retailers. Overall, the discount sector - including Poundland and its smaller rivals such as Poundworld and Poundstretcher, as well as the  fast-growing supermarket chains Aldi and Lidl - has grown 48% over the past five years, according to retail research firm The Local Data Company. This compares to the slower 34% expansion of the big four supermarket chains - Tesco, Morrisons, Asda and Sainsbury - over the same period. In fact, last year discount stores grew twice as fast as the big four supermarkets with each chain opening an average of 33 shops compared to the 16 opened by each of the bigger players. This growth in a much improved economy seems surprising, but analysts believe the recession started a much more fundamental shift. Maureen Hinton, global research director for retail research firm Conlumino, says the careful habits initially borne of necessity have now become entrenched, with people realising they don't have to pay a lot to get good quality products. She also credits the straightforward everyday pricing strategy of the discounters, compared to the "opaque" costs of their bigger rivals for their continuing popularity. "There's a genuine honesty with pound stores. People have discovered there's the opportunity to buy good stuff at low prices so why pay more?" she says. Poundland's customer data backs this up. Far from a shop just for people struggling to make ends meet, it claims to have successfully converted the middle class with a quarter of its customers now from the "AB" demographic - the wealthier end of the population. The discounters are also benefitting from a backlash against their bigger rivals: they're are seen as a welcome outsider, says Dimitrios Tsivrikos, a consumer and business psychologist at University College London. "The cheap environment, low staffing and basic shop fit outs all help. People think there's no danger here and let their guard down," he says. And conversely, because customers believe that there's no hidden agenda they spend more. "The no gimmicks, no frills, 'here we are saving money' message means people buy a lot more just because no one is trying to convince them to do it," he adds. In reality, he says people overestimate their ability to understand pricing, with the low pricing creating "a level of euphoria and excitement" that interferes with rational decision making, with "bargain" signs helping to create a sense of urgency. "We are hardwired to feel more euphoric, the hunter gatherer instinct pushes us to buy with our shopping driven by missing out rather than acquiring what we need." To take advantage of this, most of the discount stores stock a smaller constantly changing range on top of standard staples. Chris Edwards, the boss of Poundworld, says its bestselling products  are "everyday grocery items", including baby wipes, crisps and chocolate. But he says the chain, which has 280 shops nationwide, each week changes 500 of the 5,000 items it stocks to "keep up with trends", such as a range of Minions products to tie in with the forthcoming film release, and give customers "new and exciting offers". The chain has also recently launched an online shop, aimed at expanding its reach. Poundland's Mr McCarthy says it is "reasonably well advanced" with similar plans, but it is also aiming to rapidly expand its physical presence. It is using the funds from last year's Â£750m flotation on the London Stock Exchange to open more stores with a bullish long term target of opening 1,000 UK stores up from its current network of over 500 stores across the UK and Ireland. A Â£55m deal to buy smaller rival 99p Stores and convert their shops into Poundlands, which is currently being reviewed by The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), would dramatically hasten its growth. And in contrast to what you'd expect, Mr McCarthy says the "good times" are actually much better for sales. "We've been going for 25 years and seen two recessions. In good times people feel more confident and go on more shopping trips which means we get more business". He is equally upbeat about the firm's growth prospects, pointing to the success of US discount chain Dollar Tree, which has been going for half a century, for proof of Poundland's potential longevity. But others are less certain, warning that the growth of the discounters has an obvious limit. "If there are five pound shops on the high street, people are not going to spend five times as much. They are in danger of reaching a peak," warns Ms Hinton. Still, it remains hard to resist the lure of the bargain. Mr McCarthy admits that even he is not immune to the store's charms - describing it as a "Pandora's box treasure trove". He buys phone charges, Toblerone chocolate bars and biographies. "It's very difficult not to be compelled to buy," he says.	During his nine years at the helm of Poundland, says chief executive Jim McCarthy, the discount chain has sold a product at a loss just three times.
But wins for Kent and Lancashire later in the evening meant they were eliminated from the competition. Colin Ingram hit 102 off 93 balls in Glamorgan's 251-9, with James Harris taking 4-38 against his old club. But Malan and Paul Stirling (58) began Middlesex's reply with a stand of 139 as they reached 255-2 in 39.4 overs. Stirling was caught off Kieran Bull and paceman Dewi Penrhyn Jones, playing only his second game for the Welsh county, had Sam Robson lbw for 22. By then, however, it was far too late with Malan in full cry at the other end and he hit four sixes, one of them striking the top-tier balcony, and 18 fours in his 128-ball innings. Neil Dexter finished the game in style by clearing the rope from a free-hit following a no-ball by Penrhyn Jones, whose 6.4 overs cost him 73 runs. Middlesex seamer James Harris told BBC Wales Sport: "We played really well from start to finish after losing the toss, bowled really well upfront and never let Glamorgan get away from us, I managed to get a few cheap wickets at the end. "For us to finish it off with a bit of style and for Dawid (Malan) to play so well, it was a very satisfying day. "For Dawid to start like that and build an innings, when you have 140 on the board before you lose a wicket you're going to win a lot more one-day matches than you lose. Then for him to carry on and score 150 was pretty special." Glamorgan century-maker Colin Ingram told BBC Wales Sport: "It's always nice to come to Lord's, it's a good day out and I just kept working hard. When you're playing well it's key to realise that and try to extend it as long as possible. I was fortunate again to do that today and thoroughly enjoyed it." "It was nice to see two young guys (spinners Andrew Salter and Kieran Bull) do well, so that's invaluable experience for them and even some of the other younger guys, it'll be a good experience if a harsh one."	Dawid Malan hit a brilliant unbeaten 156 as Middlesex completed their One-Day Cup group stage fixtures with an eight-wicket win over Glamorgan.

Tierra del Fuego judge Lilian Herraez ordered the authorities to seize boats and other assets worth $156m. Argentina claims sovereignty of the islands, which it calls the Malvinas. The oil companies named in the case are not based in Argentina and it is not clear how the measure will be implemented. Drilling for oil in the territorial waters around the Falklands began in 2010 despite opposition from Buenos Aires. Judge Herraez says the new ruling will take steps to try to seize the companies' assets abroad. The five companies mentioned are: Premier Oil Plc, Rockhopper Exploration Plc, Falkland Oil and Gas Ltd, Noble Energy Inc and Edison International Spa. Three of the companies are British-based, one is American, based in Texas, and one is French-owned, based in Italy. Britain and Argentina went to war over the Falklands in 1982. Argentina occupied the South Atlantic archipelago for 74 days, before British forces regained control. During the conflict, 255 British and about 650 Argentine servicemen were killed, along with three Falklands civilians. Argentina accuses Britain of colonialism, saying the islands lie some 700km (450 miles) off its coast. Britain has held the Falklands for 180 years and says the wishes of its 3,000 residents should be respected. The vast majority of them want the islands to remain a British overseas territory. "They want to remain British and that view should be respected by everybody, including by Argentina," said David Cameron after a 2013 referendum in which the islanders gave almost unanimous support for the status quo. Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner said at the time that Britain was "arrogant" and "bordering on stupidity" for refusing to negotiate on the future of the islands.	A federal judge in Argentina has ordered the seizure of assets of five companies drilling for oil in the Falkland Islands.
The town is home to the prestigious Leander Club, which has trained more than 100 Olympic medal-winning rowers. Prime Minister David Cameron previously said the plan was a "very good idea". Royal Mail spokesman Simon Fellman said: "We're delighted to do it and we're pleased so many people are delighted about it." The Royal Mail has painted more than 50 postboxes gold following Team GB's gold medal haul at London 2012. Originally it said it was only painting them in "winners' home towns, or towns with which they are closely associated". Town mayor Elizabeth Hodgkin said: "We are the home of rowing... I feel very excited about it. "I think it's wonderful news, it's a great thing for the town." Mr Fellman said: "It's almost like the torch has come again. It's a piece of the Olympics coming back to people's doorsteps. "The support for the boxes, it's kind of like the new tourist attraction. It's fantastic and I think people have really taken it to their hearts." The Henley-on-Thames postbox was painted on Friday. The town is holding a victory bus parade for more than 24 Olympians on 25 August, along with a civic reception.	The Royal Mail has painted a postbox gold in the Oxfordshire town of Henley-on-Thames - in recognition of its medal winning rowing club.
As an EU member, the UK and UK-based firms can sell their goods to EU customers without having to pay additional taxes. Likewise, British firms and consumers can import from the EU tariff-free. The prime minister has already ruled out continued membership of the EU's single market post-Brexit, with many assuming this means the UK will also leave the customs union. Essentially there are two options: The WTO is an international agency with 164 member countries and its purpose is to promote international commerce. All the leading world economies are members of the WTO, including the UK. European Union countries are also all members, but they act together in the WTO as the EU. One of the most important principles of the WTO is that you should not discriminate between other WTO members. The UK and the EU would both have to impose on one another's exports the same barriers they apply to goods from the other WTO member countries.  In fact, in the absence of a free trade agreement they would be obliged under WTO rules to do that. They include import tariffs, which are taxes applied only to imports. WTO members make commitments that they will not raise tariffs above a certain level. Those maximum levels, known as bound levels or bindings, vary from country to country and product to product. The tariffs they actually apply can be, and in many cases are, below those levels. But if you do go below bound levels, you have to do it for imports from all WTO members. For the EU the average maximum tariff is 4.8% for all goods. But there are some big variations.  It's generally higher for agricultural produce, 10.9% on average. For most industrial goods it's quite low, but for cars, the tariff is 10%. Assuming the UK were trading with the EU under WTO terms, the figures are an indication of the levels of tariffs British exporters would face on their goods. It would make them less competitive in the EU market than they currently are with no tariffs at all. The UK's new schedule will have to have the consent of the other WTO members. It is administratively easier and less likely to be contested if we stick with the arrangement that we already have, as the UK's ambassador to the WTO, Julian Braithwaite. wrote in his blog: "So to minimise any grounds for objection, we plan to replicate our existing trade regime as far as possible in our new schedules." However, the UK would be free to apply lower tariffs. In some cases it is highly likely we would. For example, the EU imposes seasonal tariffs on orange imports when the Mediterranean producers have their harvest. Getting rid of that is an example of what one former trade official described to me as "low hanging fruit". Some economists, including Patrick Minford of Cardiff University and one of the leading members of Economists for Brexit (now renamed as Economists for Free Trade), favour a more comprehensive exercise in cutting tariffs and other barriers unilaterally. But these cuts would have to apply to goods coming from the EU as well. Don't be fooled, some aspects will be more complicated. For some farm produce, for example, the EU has quotas that can be imported at lower tariffs (called tariff rate quotas). We don't yet know how these will be divided between the UK and the remainder of the EU. There is also the question of what happens to that produce when it is traded between the UK and the EU. Currently it is tariff-free. Both will probably want a slice of the other's reduced tariff quota. That will mean either a bigger total quota or a reduced slice for some other country. In the WTO, the EU has agreed to a cap on some of its farm subsidies. We don't currently know what type of system the UK will adopt and potentially this an area of difficulty. The EU however is well below its subsidy cap, and that could make this area less contentious than it might have been. No. There are many other types of trade restrictions. These include rules on product specifications, labelling, testing, and requirements for authorisation from a national regulator to provide some types of services. The UK would have to decide whether or not to maintain EU rules in these areas. Currently a trade dispute would be a matter for the European Court of Justice. Theresa May has already said that its jurisdiction in the UK will end. If there is a trade agreement with the EU it would probably contain some arrangement for a tribunal to make rulings. If there is no such deal then any dispute would have to go to the WTO's dispute settlement system, which can establish panels to make rulings. Whatever happens, the UK and the EU will be subject to WTO rules. It is just that the membership of the EU and any new trade agreement that might be negotiated allows for deeper integration than is involved in simply complying with the WTO's rulebook.	With Theresa May's end of March deadline for triggering the UK's exit from the EU fast approaching, much remains undecided, not least what will happen to British trade.

"Dependency on giving that only appears to be charitable must end," he said in a tweet ahead of this weekend's African Union summit in South Africa. The BBC's Robert Kiptoo in Kenya says it is not a government policy but a rallying cry for African leaders. Aid is believed to account for 5-6% of Kenya's total income. Mr Kenyatta said that foreign aid "often carries terms and conditions that preclude progress". "It is time to give it up," he wrote.	Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta has urged fellow African leaders to stop receiving foreign aid, saying it is not an acceptable basis for prosperity.
The animal had been shot twice in the shoulder and once in its left back leg, which vets had to amputate. The charity said the one-year-old cat was "incredibly lucky" to survive. Last year the Scottish government held a consultation on licensing air weapons, but a majority of responders opposed the plan. One-year-old Teenie was found injured by her owner Sarah Nisbett in NiddryView, Winchburgh, at about 16:30 on Friday 14 March and taken to the Scottish SPCA. Mrs Nisbett said the cat was now having to learn how to walk again. "The gun that was used must have some power because the pellet actually went through her back leg, that's why it was so badly damaged," she said. "She's now learning how to hop around the house, it's terrible. "The fact that it was three shots is crazy. We live in a housing estate and there are lots of kids. That just makes it worse because any of them could have been hit in the crossfire." She added: "There's some sick people out there, hopefully somebody will know who's done this and let the police or the Scottish SPCA know." Scottish SPCA Ch Supt Mike Flynn said: "Teenie's owners are understandably very upset and keen for us to find the callous person responsible to ensure no more cats come to harm. "This is an alarming incident which only highlights why the Scottish government should implement the licensing of airguns as a matter of urgency." He added: "The new licensing regime should ensure that only those with a lawful reason are allowed to possess such a dangerous weapon. It will also help the police trace anyone using an air gun irresponsibly." Last year the Scottish government launched a consultation on licensing air weapons, with a large majority of those who responded opposing the plan. Under the proposed scheme, anyone wanting to own an air gun would need to demonstrate they had a legitimate reason for doing so. A total of 87% of respondents rejected the idea - with some describing it as "draconian" and "heavy-handed". A small number of people felt ministers were not going far enough. The Scottish SPCA urged anyone with information about the incident to contact them.	An animal charity is calling for the licensing of air guns after a cat in West Lothian was left injured after being shot three times.
Alasdair Dudgeon was killed near the Kincardine Bridge on 6 January 2013 when James Sneddon knocked him off his bike in the early hours of the morning. Mr Dudgeon suffered a broken neck and internal injuries as he commuted to his work at a bakery near Falkirk at 02:00. Sneddon, 42, was found guilty of causing the 51-year-old's death, after a trial at the High Court in Edinburgh. Mr Dudgeon, of High Valleyfield in Fife, regularly cycled to and from his work as a baker at Tesco in Camelon, just outside Falkirk. He was cycling on the A985 road between the Longannet roundabout and the Kincardine Bridge when he was hit by a Vauxhall Astra driven by Sneddon, of Falkirk. Sneddon called an ambulance, but paramedics found no sign of a pulse on the victim before taking him to Forth Valley Hospital in Larbert, where he was pronounced dead. Witnesses said weather conditions were clear and visibility was reasonable on the night of the crash, with a police officer noting that the red flashing light on Mr Dudgeon's bike was bright enough to be seen from 300m away. Prosecutors said that although Mr Dudgeon had not been wearing a high visibility jacket, Sneddon should have seen him well before the collision and should have taken steps to avoid the cyclist. The Crown originally charged Sneddon with causing Mr Dudgeon's death by dangerously failing to observe the cyclist and colliding with the rear of his bike, which he denied. After a trial, the jury found him guilty on the lesser charge of death by careless driving. He will be sentenced later after background reports are compiled.	A motorist who fatally injured a cyclist has been convicted of causing death by careless driving.
Chiefs, third in the Premiership, had only four players included in squads for this year's Six Nations. That compares to the seven players called up from each of leaders Wasps, second-placed Saracens and fourth-placed Bath's squads. Asked if that was a surprise, Baxter replied: "not particularly". "You've got to understand that although we've finished the end of the season very well and we had guys away on Saxons duty and other internationals, we actually didn't start this season very well," he told BBC Radio Devon. "We weren't performing either as a team or individually at the intensity that you need to to demand an international selection. "I think Luke Cowan-Dickie is getting close now, you can see the level of his performances the last month or so have been fantastic, and I think Henry [Slade] is very close. "But overall if we want to drive our players into the international setups we have to perform at a very high intensity and as individuals they have to perform at a very high intensity."	Exeter head coach Rob Baxter says his side need to perform consistently at a "high intensity" if they are to earn more international recognition.
It is showcasing the huge amount which can be achieved by adults with learning difficulties and children with complex needs. The "We Can" project has held exhibitions at the Senedd, Houses of Parliament and in 24 countries. Mold-based Same but Different is behind it and everyone involved has a learning disability. "Sometimes people make remarks that I can't do things and this makes you feel like you can't do it, but then I look back and realise that I can do things," said Scott Morris, 20, from Deeside. "I may learn a bit slower, but I can still do what you can do." Scott said his dream is to become a farmer and, if he does not achieve it, he will be "really sad". Kate Siseman, 36, from Buckley, who has Down's Syndrome, has enjoyed doing an office and media course. She said: "I love the fact you can listen to music while you type because it helps me clear my mind out. "If I had to describe myself I would say I was smart, friendly, caring, kind and very sociable." Other people involved include Paige Bedford, aged 19, from Bagillt, who is on the autism spectrum. She said: "Having a disability makes you unique, it makes you different from other people. "It sets you apart.  It gives you a hidden edge that you don't know you have until you discover it." Photographer and founder of Same but Different, Ceridwen Hughes, said "The aim of our organisation is to use the arts to create greater awareness of the person behind disability."	A new arts-based project using photography and video aims to show the people behind disability.
The 26-year-old will join Wednesday on a permanent transfer in the summer for a fee believed to be £10m. The Owls had to wait until Wednesday for the English Football League to decide if the deal had been completed by Tuesday's 23:00 GMT deadline. Rhodes scored six goals in 24 league appearances for Boro after joining from Blackburn for £9m in January 2016. However, the Scotland international, featured just six times this season and failed to score. He started his career with Ipswich and had loan spells with Oxford, Rochdale and Brentford before joining Huddersfield in July 2009. Rhodes scored 73 goals in 124 league appearances for the Terriers and helped them to promotion from League One in 2012. Blackburn paid the Terriers £8m for him in August 2012 following their relegation from the Premier League. He moved on to Boro last January after scoring 83 goals in 159 league games for Rovers and helped Aitor Karanka's side win promotion to the Premier League. Rhodes' father, Andy, is the goalkeeping coach at Hillsborough. Find all the latest football transfers on our dedicated page or visit our Premier League tracker here.

Rees, who starred in BBC drama series Poldark in the 1970s, was 63. In a statement, her family said they were "deeply saddened" and the actress, who also enjoyed an extensive theatre career, would be "greatly missed". "Angharad passed away peacefully today with her family at her bedside in London, after a long battle with pancreatic cancer," her family said. Rees was married to the late Dynasty actor Christopher Cazenove for more than 20 years and they had two sons together, Linford and Rhys, 35. Linford, the elder of the two, died in a car crash on the M11 in Essex in 1999 aged 25. In 1994 the actress divorced Cazenove and went on to marry David McAlpine, of the construction family, in 2005, with whom she lived in London. Rees played Demelza in Poldark, a costume drama based on the novels written by Winston Graham and first broadcast in the UK between 1975 and 1977. She also had a role in cult classic Jack the Ripper film Hands Of The Ripper and on stage she appeared in A Winter's Tale, Richard II and Romeo And Juliet. In addition to her acting success, she also founded an eponymously titled jewellery design company based in Knightsbridge, with her pieces featured in the film Elizabeth, The Golden Age. Her family said she remained an active supporter of the arts and was an honorary fellow of the Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama in Cardiff, the city where she grew up as a young child. Her funeral will be private but there are plans for a service in celebration of her life which will be announced at a later date.	Welsh actress Angharad Rees has died after a long battle with cancer, her family has said.
Councils in England are being allowed to raise the tax by 6% over two years to plug a care funding gap. But Wales' Social Services Minister Rebecca Evans told BBC Wales that increasing the tax was not "fair" and "not an approach we're taking". The Welsh Local Government Association has warned councils face a Â£92m social care "black hole" in 2017-18. Leading experts say the cost of providing care could double to Â£2.3bn by 2030. Speaking on The Wales Report on Wednesday, Ms Evans said: "Some parts of Wales have a much larger proportion of older people than others. "And obviously if we were to put the burden on local authorities to raise council tax to pay for that, it would disproportionately affect some parts of Wales more than others." Ms Evans said Welsh ministers wanted to take a longer term approach towards social care but "we do need the UK government to help us with this". "We don't know what our long-term funding is going to be from the UK government," she said. "So these are issues that are beyond our control, but within our control we're certainly doing everything we can to make social care good quality and fair across Wales in terms of paying for care as well." "I'm under no illusion how fragile the sector is in Wales, and the fact that Welsh Government does need to support it," she added. Mario Kreft, chair of Care Forum Wales which represents independent care providers, said that in a "relatively mild winter we're seeing huge pressures" in Wales and across the UK. "This should be no surprise to anybody," he said. "The reality is that we are a million miles away from where we need to be, where we could've been, and we need a wake up call." The Wales Report is on BBC One Wales at 22:40 GMT on Wednesday 8 February.	Spiralling social care costs cannot be met by increasing council taxes in Wales, ministers have ruled.
Rovers began in the final relegation place, level on points with Forest with an inferior goal difference. Charlie Mulgrew's free-kick and Danny Guthrie's strike put Rovers ahead, before Lasse Vibe flicked one back. Craig Conway's spot-kick made it 3-1, as Bees' Harlee Dean saw red but Forest and Birmingham wins sent Rovers down. With Birmingham only leading 1-0 against Bristol City at Ashton Gate, a goal for the Robins would have sent Blues down instead of Blackburn - but Harry Redknapp's side held on. Blackburn had lifted themselves out of the drop zone earlier in the day thanks to Mulgrew's superb free-kick into the top corner. Guthrie's scuffed effort, which Bees keeper Daniel Bentley should have kept out, doubled their lead, but Britt Assombalonga's goal to put Forest ahead at the City Ground dropped Rovers back into the bottom three. There was further anguish for Tony Mowbray's side when Vibe got in front of a defender at the near post to turn in Dean's delivery. Mowbray threw on attack-minded Lucas Joao, Marvin Emnes and Conway in a bid to improve their goal difference. Emnes was then fouled in the box by Dean, who was given his second yellow card, and Conway blasted home the penalty. But Rovers, with an inferior goal difference to Forest of just two goals, were relegated to the third tier for the first time in 37 years. It has been a season-long struggle for Blackburn, both on and off the pitch, having failed to rise above 20th in the table all season. Supporters have also protested against owners Venky's, who have seen the club slide from the Premier League to the third tier in their seven years at the helm. Some fans voiced their concern prior to the match that relegation this season could lead to potential administration. Away from the boardroom, the Lancashire side began the season with Owen Coyle at the helm, who could claim he was not backed in the transfer market, having spent £250,000 of the £10m he recouped in the transfer market. Coyle left in February after losing just under half his matches in charge and was replaced by Mowbray with the club three points off safety with 15 games to play. Mowbray had moved to Ewood Park five months after resigning as manager of League One side Coventry, a club that were also relegated this term and with controversial owners of their own. The new manager's change to a back three proved important in Rovers giving themselves a chance of survival, but it was too late for the 1994-95 Premier League winners. Blackburn manager Tony Mowbray: "I am disappointed now but we have to try to keep the spirit we showed here and, if we do, the club will be very strong in League One next year. "It's decided over 46 games and at the end of the season everyone at the club from the players to the medical team and the analysts have not been good enough to stay in this division. "We have to take it on the chin. It's going to be a huge summer for us in terms of recruitment, and conversations with the owners are coming - we have to recruit well, be strong next year and bounce back. "We need to keep our under-contract players. If we do, we will hopefully be too strong for a lot of clubs in League One. We just need to turn the ship around and get promotion." Brentford boss Dean Smith: "We wanted to finish the season on a high but there were a lot of tired legs out there - at the end they were putting their bodies on the line and that showed how much it mattered to do their best for the other clubs down there. "It was what we were doing when we didn't have the ball that annoyed me in the first half. I gave them a rocket at half-time and we started the second half quite well but couldn't make our possession count. "I feel for Tony. He has done a great job there and if he's allowed to keep the players he has, and the club keep him, then I'm sure they'll be knocking on the door to come back up next season."

London Fire Brigade said it was called to the arena on Millennium Way, Greenwich, at about 11:15 BST. About 21 firefighters tackled the blaze, which was contained to the restaurant's extraction system. Station Manager Martin Freeman said: "It did create a lot of smoke and so security staff evacuated people from arena. There were no injuries." At the time Julie Price tweeted: "At O2 for Elvis exhibition but can't go in as its on fire." The cause of the fire is not yet known.	More than 1,200 people were evacuated from the O2 Arena in London due to a fire at a restaurant.
Jamal Hakrush starts his job as deputy commissioner after months of violence between Israelis and Palestinians. He will oversee policing in Arab communities where there is a longstanding distrust of the police. A fifth of Israel's population is Arab and they often complain that areas in which they live are not so well policed and have poorer public services. Their grievances have been supported by Human Rights Watch which in recent years has published several reports highlighting the discrimination which it is argued the Arab population faces. Deputy Commissioner Hakrush, from the Galilee village of Kafr Kanna, will be in charge of a newly-created police division established to improve policing in Arab communities, The Times of Israel reported. Deputy Commissioner Hakrush was formally appointed into his new position on Wednesday at a ceremony attended by Police Commissioner Roni Alsheich. One of his main responsibilities will be to stop illegal weapons falling into the hands of the Arab community. Mr Alsheich also wants to reduce domestic violence, murder rates and other crimes in the Arab sector. He and the government wants to recruit 1,300 new officers and construct several new stations in Arab population centres.	An Arab police officer has been promoted by Israel to the highest rank ever attained by a Muslim in the force.
US experts found B3, also known as nicotinamide, boosts the ability of immune cells to kill Staphylococcus bacteria. B3 increases the numbers and efficacy of neutrophils, white blood cells that can kill and eat harmful bugs. The study, in the Journal of Clinical Investigation, could lead to a "major change in treatment", a UK expert said. B3 was tested on Staphylococcal infections, such as the potentially fatal MRSA (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus). Such infections are found in hospitals and nursing homes, but are also on the rise in prisons, the military and among athletes. The scientists used extremely high doses of B3 - far higher than that obtained from dietary sources - in their tests, carried out both on animals and on human blood. And the researchers say there is as yet no evidence that dietary B3 or supplements could prevent or treat bacterial infections. The researchers say B3 appears to be able to "turn on" certain antimicrobial genes, boosting the immune cells' killing power. Prof Adrian Gombart, of Oregon State University's Linus Pauling Institute, who worked on the research, said: "This is potentially very significant, although we still need to do human studies. "Antibiotics are wonder drugs, but they face increasing problems with resistance by various types of bacteria, especially Staphylococcus aureus. "This could give us a new way to treat Staph infections that can be deadly, and might be used in combination with current antibiotics. "It's a way to tap into the power of the innate immune system and stimulate it to provide a more powerful and natural immune response." Prof Mark Enright, of the University of Bath, said: "Neutrophils  are really the front line against infections in the blood and the use of nicotinamide seems safe at this dose to use in patients as it is already licensed for use. "This could cause a major change in treatment for infections alongside conventional antibiotics to help bolster patients immune system. "I would like to see in patient clinical trials but cannot see why this couldn't be used straight away in infected patients."	Vitamin B3 could be the new weapon in the fight against superbugs such as MRSA, researchers have suggested.
Thousands of people were at the ceremony at BAE Systems' Devonshire Dock Hall in Barrow to mark the end of the build process for Artful. Another four of the nuclear-powered submarines are being built at the yard. The ceremony was carried out by Amanda Lady Zambellas, wife of the Royal Navy's First Sea Lord, Admiral Sir George Zambellas. BAE Systems Maritime - Submarines managing director John Hudson said: "The design and build of a nuclear-powered submarine is as challenging as it is complex, so today represents a significant milestone in Artful's programme. "It requires real skill and innovation to deliver submarines as sophisticated as Artful and this would not have been possible without the valued contribution of our employees and the collaborative efforts of the whole submarine enterprise." Artful will remain at the Barrow yard while commissioning activities are carried out and is due to be launched early next year for further tests. HMS Astute and HMS Ambush have already been launched. The other vessels are at various stages in the design and build process and will be called Audacious, Anson, Agamemnon and Ajax. The Barrow yard has been working on the Astute programme since 2001. The Ministry of Defence said the Astute class of submarines have greater firepower, state-of-the-art communications equipment and advanced stealth technology, making them quiet and harder to detect.	The third Astute Class submarine to be built at a Cumbrian shipyard has been named.
In an open letter, he said he loved Russia, calling it "a great democracy". Mr Depardieu had recently announced he would give up his French passport after the government criticised his decision to move abroad to avoid higher taxes. Moscow earlier said President Vladimir Putin had personally signed the decree granting the actor Russian citizenship. In December, Mr Putin had said he would be happy to welcome the actor in his new country. "If he'd like to have a Russian passport, consider it settled," Mr Putin said. Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault had called Mr Depardieu's decision to leave the country "shabby". In the letter, broadcast on Thursday on Russian TV station Pervyi Kanal, Mr Depardieu said: "I filed a passport application and I am pleased that it was accepted. "I love your country, Russia - its people, its history, its writers. I love your culture, your intelligence." He said that he had spoken to French President Francois Hollande and told him Russia was "a great democracy, and not a country where the prime minister calls one of its citizens shabby". Under France's civil code, dual citizenship is permitted but it is unlawful to be stateless. A person must obtain another nationality before giving up French citizenship. Mr Depardieu's highly publicised tax row began last year after Mr Hollande said he would raise taxes to 75% for those earning more than 1m euros (Â£817,400). The actor accused the new socialist government of punishing "success, creation and talent", and announced in early December that he would move to Belgium. Although the Constitutional Council struck down the tax rise proposal on Sunday, Mr Depardieu said this did not change the situation "one bit". The BBC's Hugh Schofield in Paris says the series of events would be amusingly eccentric, were it not also serious in its implications for France's international image. Mr Depardieu, described by Mr Putin as a successful businessman and friend, has developed close ties with Russia, which has a flat 13% personal income tax rate. He currently appears in an advertisement for Sovietsky Bank's credit card and is prominently featured on the bank's home page. In 2011, he played the lead role in the film Rasputin, a Franco-Russian production about the life of eccentric monk Grigory Rasputin. In addition, Mr Depardieu has also helped raise funds for a children's hospital in St Petersburg.	Actor Gerard Depardieu has hailed Russia's decision to grant him citizenship, following a tax row with the government in his native France.
But archaeologist Steve Clarke believes this fortified farmhouse once stood on stilts on a manmade island in an Ice Age lake 4,900 years ago. The "crannog's" timbers survived and carbon dating said they were built on Jordan Way, Monmouth, 2,917 years BC. A slab of timber was discovered when the estate was constructed in 2003. It is the second crannog discovered in Wales. But the first, at Llangorse Lake, in the Brecon Beacons, is thousands of years younger than the recent discovery. "This is very important, it was a huge lake that was here until the Iron Age," said Mr Clarke, 70. "This will tell us what was happening here in the Stone Age - we know so little about that period."	This ancient fort could not look more different to the red brick housing estate currently occupying suburbia in Monmouthshire.
Police said they were called to Wingfield Road, Alfreton, at about 03:55 BST on Monday, where the body was discovered. Detectives said the man had suffered head injuries and has not yet been formally identified. The road was closed in both directions and police have appealed for people who were in the area between 03:00 and 04:00 to contact them. Officers also want to hear from anyone who have noticed any damage to a car that could have happened overnight.	A man has been found dead in a road in Derbyshire.
Virtus, which is replacing Osprey armour, is described by the Ministry of Defence (MoD) as "one of the most advanced integrated body armour and load carrying systems in the world". But among other complaints, soldiers say its webbing - where ammunition and kit is stored - has been snapping. The MoD said it was working with the armour's supplier to make improvements. Virtus body armour was first rolled out at the beginning of the year and is gradually replacing Osprey armour in phases. So far around 9,000 units of Virtus body armour, helmets and load-carrying systems have been issued to a number of units - including members of the Parachute Regiment, the Rifles, Royal Marines and Royal Artillery. The main advantage of the Virtus system is that it is lighter. But soldiers have said it gives limited space for extra equipment - such as radios and medical supplies - and that if soldiers go to ground with it they find it hard to get back up. "Daysack and Bergen should be used as fire fuel" is one of their comments on social media. Others said: "Just about room for a Mars bar and biscuits" and "Snapping!" The Virtus system is 4.7kg (10.4lb) lighter than the older Osprey body armour and will become even lighter when new armour plates are issued. There are good reasons to ease the burden. In Afghanistan a British soldier on patrol could be carrying loads of around 22kg (50lbs). The Taliban would often refer to them as "tortoises" or "camels" on their radios as the British soldier nearly buckled under the weight. These heavy loads made it more difficult to move "tactically" and could contribute to muscular/skeletal  injuries. The likelihood that women will soon be allowed to serve alongside men in close combat roles is another reason to address the issue surrounding weight. The most radical innovation of the new Virtus kit is an integral spine, known as the dynamic weight distribution system. It is linked to the wearer's waist belt and helps spread the load across their back, shoulders and hips. Instead of the old Velcro straps, there is a quick release pin - a bonus when soldiers need to ditch their equipment to fight. The new helmet is also lighter. Virtus is also "modular" - so pouches can easily be added or subtracted. The father of one serving soldier issued with the equipment got in touch with the BBC to complain. He said he was "appalled" that soldiers were being issued with what he considered to be "sub-standard kit" and hoped the British Army had learned from the lessons of the past. He said his son and his comrades had found it all but impossible to get back on their feet when they went to ground wearing the new system - making life difficult for an infantry soldier. They were also unable to squeeze all their equipment into the new Bergen rucksacks and had trouble putting the armour on in the dark, he said. The MoD said: "As with every new system there have been some issues during the initial roll out, and, as a result of constructive feedback from our troops, we are working with our supplier to make improvements." The MoD added that the  supplier of the system, an Israeli company, was required to address any problems as  as part of the Â£14.6m contract.	British army soldiers have raised concerns about their new body armour, the BBC has learned.
Sgt Mark Wright was injured in February 2012 while restraining a "dangerously out of control" man armed with two knives. Police were called after reports that a number of women had been assaulted at the house. They were told a woman and two children were still inside with the man. Sgt Wright was about to force entry to the house when the man emerged, armed with two knives. When the officer and a colleague tried to restrain him he was stabbed in the head. "The cut to the back of the head cut right through the tissue around the back of my head, right down to my skull," Sgt Wright said. "There were puncture wounds to my face and forehead, narrowly missing my eye." Although seriously wounded, Sgt Wright's actions were judged to have ensured the safety of the two young children, the woman and his two colleagues. His attacker was arrested, charged and subsequently sentenced to seven years in prison. Sgt Wright said while he was proud to have been awarded the medal, his colleagues should share the honour. "In fairness, this is happening to police officers every day, they're facing similar dangers," he said. "In receiving this award I can honestly say I am extremely proud, but I am truly humbled as well. "I accept it not just on behalf of myself, my family and my friends, but for all my colleagues." Sgt Wright will receive his medal at Buckingham Palace later this year, although the date has not yet been set.	A police officer who has been awarded the Queen's Gallantry Medal after being stabbed in the head at a house in Lurgan has said he is "truly humbled".
Rakhmat Akilov reportedly ran from the scene still covered in blood and glass, and was arrested hours later in a northern suburb of Stockholm. He has yet to be identified by police, who have only said that the man in custody is a 39-year-old Uzbek national. Even so, a picture of the man allegedly behind the attack has started to emerge: someone who had failed in his bid to get residency, lost his job and was hiding from police who wanted to deport him. Bumping into a former colleague earlier this year, he revealed he was spending his days "sleeping and smoking". According to reports, he had left a wife and four children behind in Uzbekistan in order to earn money to send home. He had applied for residency in 2014, but had been informed in December 2016 that "he had four weeks to leave the country", police official Jonas Hysing said. He did not leave and, in February, was officially put on a wanted list. A few months earlier, it is claimed he had lost his job after falling asleep at work. He had been working in construction, and was employed by Pierre Svensson for several weeks late last year, helping on an asbestos removal project. Mr Akilov was, he said, "a reserved person". "He didn't stick out. He did his job. You can't say he was very sociable, we just told him what to do and he did it. He didn't speak much Swedish," he told news agency AFP. Mr Akilov was also described as not being particularly religious. One has suggested he "partied and drank", which goes against strict Islamic doctrine. "He never talked about politics or religion," one friend told Swedish daily Aftonbladet. "He didn't pray five times a day from what I know." A co-worker agreed, telling news agency Reuters: "He was like any normal guy." Online, it seems, it was a different story. His Facebook page - which has since been taken down - is linked to a number of extremists through friends and featured at least two propaganda videos linked to IS, one reportedly showing the aftermath of the Boston bombing. He also liked a page called "Friends of Libya and Syria", which says it aims to expose "terrorism of the imperialistic financial capitals" of the US, British and Arab "dictatorships". However, he was also a fan of pages dedicated to Playboy magazine and Russian tennis player Maria Sharapova. Despite all this, Mr Akilov was not considered a threat by Swedish security services, who dismissed him as a "marginal character", apparently on the fringes of larger extremist movements.	The main suspect of ploughing a truck into a department store in central Stockholm, killing four people, had been denied residency in Sweden and had expressed sympathy for so-called Islamic State (IS), police and reports said.
Private rents "eat up" more than 50% of a family's monthly earnings in 23 out of the capital's 33 boroughs. Shelter said the "rent trap" in the private sector leaves families unable to save towards buying a home and urged London's mayor to intervene. Mayor Boris Johnson said: "I think it's very important that we expand the supply available." The report comes after the mayor put out a series of proposals in December to "empower tenants and landlords" in the private rental sector. Shelter's report, based on an online study by YouGov of 1,397 adults in London in February 2012, found up to half (49%) of the people surveyed said they received "poor or very poor value for money from renting, from letting agents or private landlords". A third of families also worried about their contract ending before they are able to move out. Campbell Robb, chief executive of Shelter, said: "The news that renting in the capital is unaffordable isn't a surprise to the families across London who are stuck in the rent trap, unable to save anything towards a home of their own because they are paying out so much each month in rent. "But the fact that rental costs in most areas of London are eating up more than half of family incomes should stop us in our tracks. "Rising rents, the constant threat of eviction, and hidden fees are all par for the course in London's frantic rental market." Mr Johnson said: "I think it's very important that we expand the supply available... we need more on the market altogether. "What I think is less persuasive is the case for some sort of legislation about renting and prices. The difficulty with that we think is it would tend to drive them (landlords) out of the market." The mayor's plans include getting funding from the government's Â£200m equity fund for the construction of new homes.	Up to 59% of a typical London family's income is spent on rents, a study by housing charity Shelter has revealed.
The 38-year-old spinner skippered the side to the Division Two title in 2015. "We've got a very special set of players at the moment and it's a great honour to be able to lead them onto the field," he told the club website. "Promotion last season was just the start of what we can achieve. I look forward to playing my part in our continued development." Batty is currently in his second spell at The Oval, having played for Surrey between 1998 and 2001 before returning to south London ahead of the 2010 campaign. He was appointed captain at the start of this year and took 40 first-class wickets at an average of 28.17 last season as Surrey won promotion to Division One. "Batts is playing an incredibly important part of what we're trying to achieve at Surrey," director of cricket Alec Stewart said. "He has shown real leadership qualities on and off the field and his all-round contribution in the progress we are making should not be underestimated."	Surrey captain Gareth Batty has signed a new contract which will keep him at the club until the end of 2017.
Homeowners hit by the flooding in December can apply for up to Â£5,000 from the government's Future Flood Prevention Funding scheme. Figures seen by the BBC show that only 13 people have applied for the money. Rachael Maskell, Labour MP for York Central, said she had received complaints about accessing the fund. "The form filling is incredibly complicated and that's where people have been struggling," she said. "It's putting off a lot on people." Hundreds of homes and businesses were flooded in the city after the Rivers Foss and Ouse burst their banks. The scheme is administered by City of York Council and requires a survey to be carried out on the flooded property before funding can be applied for. The council said that 360 private homes were eligible for the grant. The authority added: "We very much welcome grant applications but know that this can take time while people wait for quotes and loss adjustor reports. "We're appointing a case worker to help residents and businesses through the application process."	York residents are being put off applying for flood protection grants as the process is "incredibly complicated", a local MP has claimed.
Alasdair McCrone, of Mull Theatre, and Gordon McLean, of the arts centre An Tobar, were among three directors of the umbrella body Comar. It looks after a number of arts organisations on the island. Comar's board said funding restrictions made it necessary to reduce three posts to one. It said the three existing directorial posts - in theatre/dance, visual arts/film and music/literature - would be replaced by one artistic director who would lead the entire creative programme Comar, which was created two years ago, said it hoped to continue to work with both Mr McCrone and McLean. Equity blames poor business planning and is calling on the board to resign. A public meeting about the decision is to be held in Tobermory next week. High-profile Scottish actor Alan Cumming tweeted: "This makes me so sad.  Another example of the accountants take over at the expense of the art. And in Mull too." Former Scottish culture secretary and SNP MSP for Argyll and Bute, Michael Russell, tweeted: "Making Alasdair & Gordon redundant is an extraordinary wrong-headed decision and must be opposed."	The actors' union Equity has hit out at the decision to remove two of Mull's best-known creative directors from their posts.
Media playback is not supported on this device The Spaniard became the only man to win three times so far this season. He drove a controlled race and stayed just far enough ahead of his pursuers to maintain the lead. Great strategy calls from the team to keep me ahead through the pit stops. I knew it would be a long race to the end Button climbed up from sixth on the grid to pass Vettel at the second pit stops but was re-passed with two laps to go. However, the Englishman was promoted to second place after race stewards gave Vettel a 20-second penalty for his overtake of Button on the penultimate lap. Lewis Hamilton retired with gearbox damage after running well down the field following an early puncture. But he will not incur any penalty for a gearbox change because of his retirement. The result extends Alonso's championship lead to 34 points ahead of Red Bull's Mark Webber who had a low-key race to eighth place, never showing any real pace. Alonso said: "It was tough, not an easy race. Maybe we were not the quickest in dry conditions but we were competitive and it was enough to maintain the lead. "Great strategy calls from the team to keep me ahead through the pit stops. I knew it would be a long race to the end, with Jenson putting pressure. "But the car was feeling good on top speed and traction and that was enough to keep the lead into Turn 6, and after that overtaking is not so easy." Media playback is not supported on this device The only consolation for Hamilton on the occasion of his 100th grand prix was that the McLaren showed encouraging pace following a major performance upgrade. At one stage, Hamilton unlapped himself on Vettel - although not Alonso - as he attempted vainly to recover from his early set-back. A move which angered the double world champion. Alonso was never very far in front but was always able to stay just far enough ahead of first Vettel and then Button to ensure they could not use their DRS overtaking aids to pass him into the hairpin at Turn 6. It led to a tense grand prix in which the identity of the winner was always in doubt until Alonso took the chequered flag. The Ferrari made a lightning start from pole position and although Vettel quickly closed up the initial gap Alonso had built on the first lap, the Spaniard was able to pull clear before their first pit stops to ensure he held the lead into the second stint. Meanwhile, Button was fighting past Hulkenberg and then Schumacher, to move quietly into third place. Vettel emerged from his first pit stop five seconds ahead of Button but the McLaren closed remorselessly on the Red Bull and passed the German by making his second stop a lap earlier. Vettel emerged from the pits to find Button on his outside on the run to Turn 2, and the McLaren easily took the position. Button was rarely more than a second behind Alonso from then until the end of the race but the Ferrari driver was always in control and in the closing laps he stretched away as Button began to lose grip in his rear tyres. Rather than try to take the lead, Button had to spend the closing laps fighting off a late challenge from Vettel, who passed him at the Turn 6 hairpin on the penultimate lap. Vettel said: "The pace was there but it was extremely difficult when I was close to Fernando and Jenson we seemed to lose a lot and not be able to stay close enough to try to something under braking. "I am not entirely happy, it could have been a bit better if it was clean air most of the race but that was not the case. Second place was the best we could get today and I am happy with that." Button said: "It was a close race and I couldn't quite get Fernando at the end. "When you are in the middle of three you really have to fight and I was pushing a little bit more in the early part of the stint, whereas when you're in front you can coast a bit in the bits where you don't need to push. "It was close but Fernando knows as we all do where to use Kers to keep someone behind you. I ran out of steam at the end of the straight and the gap was a little bit too big to get back. "But it was a fun race and it's nice to be on the podium again. I've had my feeling back the last two races but the pace hasn't been there [in the car], but today it was. We're there or thereabouts at the front, still a little way to go." Raikkonen provided some exciting racing as he moved up from 10th on the grid. On the way, Raikkonen engaged in top-class racing with Mercedes driver Michael Schumacher and the Force Indias of Nico Hulkenberg and Paul di Resta. Schumacher finished seventh behind Sauber drivers Kamui Kobayashi and Sergio Perez. Hulkenberg and Di Resta took the final points positions in ninth and 10th.	Ferrari's Fernando Alonso beat Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel and McLaren's Jenson Button in a close fight to win the German Grand Prix.
Microsoft paid more than $1bn for most of AOL's patents, beating rivals reported to have included Facebook. Facebook was sued by Yahoo for patent infringement earlier this year. The social networking site, which is preparing for a stock market listing, also reported a drop in its first quarter profits to $205m from $233m a year earlier. A Facebook lawyer described the deal as: "Another significant step in our ongoing process of building an intellectual property portfolio to protect Facebook's interests." Microsoft bought 925 patents and patent applications from AOL. It is now selling 650 of those patents to Facebook as well as licences to the other 275. "Today's agreement with Facebook enables us to recoup over half of our costs while achieving our goals from the AOL auction," said Microsoft's general counsel Brad Smith. There has been a series of recent patent deals between technology companies as they try to defend themselves in lawsuits. If a company successfully sues another it can demand a sales ban of its competitor's products, or force the loser to pay expensive licence fees. Since the start of the year, Intel, Google and Facebook are among those to have bought significant numbers of patents from other technology companies. Facebook bought a number of patents from IBM last month. Also on Monday, Facebook reported results for the first three months of the year. The company, which is expected to list on the stock market in the coming months, reported a drop in its net income between January and March to $205m from $233m in the same period last year. Revenues for the quarter came in at $1.06bn, down 6% from the final three months of 2011. Facebook said that its advertising business usually slows down in the first quarter but that the growth of the business in previous years had masked that trend. Facebook also revealed that it has agreed to pay $200m to Instagram if its recent $1bn deal to buy the photo-sharing firm were to fall through.	Facebook is paying Microsoft $550m (Â£341m) for some of the patents it recently bought from AOL.
The City Council wants to add an extra 700 spaces to the east of the Seacourt site, which currently has 794 spaces in an attempt to ease congestion. Proposals include a new waiting area building and increased cycle parking. The council said it considered relocating to a lower flood-risk zone but had not been able to find a suitable alternative. A spokesman said: "The proposals respond to the rapid growth that is anticipated in the city centre, particularly the west end regeneration area." The site, which serves users entering from the west of the city, has been operating for more than 30 years. Subject to planning consent, work could start in Spring 2016 with the complex anticipated to be open in the Summer of 2017. A public exhibition is being held at the Assembly Room at Oxford's Town Hall. There will be a further session on 19 September at the West Oxford Community Centre.	Plans to expand one of Oxford's Park and Rides into the Green Belt have been unveiled.
However, there were people in the TV industry who thought the cast would struggle to find work once their time on the show was up. Some of the actors were warned that they wouldn't be able to shake off their sulky, angry, teen characters. But when you look at the careers of Dev Patel and Jack O'Connell for example, they couldn't have been more wrong. Kaya Scodelario was one of the longest-serving members of the cast, appearing in series one to four as Effy Stonem. She went on to appear in sci-fi thriller Maze Runner and is now in Australia filming the next instalment of Pirates of The Caribbean with Johnny Depp. Nicholas Hoult was the only member of the main cast who had serious acting experience. He'd starred in About a Boy with Hugh Grant in 2002. He has since gone on to play Beast in the X-Men prequels and will soon be seen starring opposite Kristen Stewart in a film called Equals. Dev Patel's first job after playing Anwar Kharral in series one and two, took him from London to India and to the Oscars with Slumdog Millionaire. He told Newsbeat, he never would have got that role without Skins. "My career started off because Danny Boyle's daughter was a fan of the show, that is how I got an audition for Slumdog." He has two films out in cinemas at the moment, The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel with Dame Judi Dench and Chappie, starring alongside Sigourney Weaver and Hugh Jackman. Jack O'Connell, who played Cook in series three and four, was hand-picked by Angelina Jolie to star in her most recent movie Unbroken. The 24-year-old also picked up the Rising Star Award at this year's Baftas. Fans of Game of Thrones will be familiar with Joe Dempsie and Hannah Murray who play Gendry and Gilly respectively. It is, of course, not unusual for an actor from a British television show to find success in Hollywood films. What is unusual is the amount of stars that were discovered from one single teen drama on a digital channel. So how were the makers of Skins able to spot so many talented young actors? Co-creator Bryan Elsley told Newsbeat they made a conscious decision to hold open auditions. "There are really good kids working from agencies and drama schools but just on that one occasion we decided to go a different way," he explained. "We felt if we had young people playing characters the same age as themselves, and those actors weren't too trained, it would have a more natural feel." It sounds quite risky, but Bryan said the show was such a small project to begin with, they were able to take that approach. Jack O'Connell credits the whole team for the actors' future success. "I think they knew if they were going to identify that genre, that era, that generation, they needed people on the ground level," he said. "A writing team that understood, they got that right first and then I guess they chose to cast exciting people. "I feel very fortunate to be involved in the show but I don't think it was a coincidence that we all came through there." Piers Wenger is the head of drama at Channel 4 and he thinks it was the opportunities the cast had to stretch themselves that helped nurture their talent. "They had the opportunity to do properly complex [roles], rather than just two dimensional ones," he said. "It is extraordinary, in the past soap operas had been the sort of places where young people had been able to do their first job. "That would have been your only break, but time's are changing. "I think thanks to shows like Skins, unconventional approaches to casting are becoming more and more common."

Robert Lewandowski's penalty gave the German champions the lead before Thomas Muller swept home on his 27th birthday. Joshua Kimmich stabbed in and quickly added a header as Bayern boss Carlo Ancelotti became the first man to manage seven clubs in the competition. Juan Bernat fired in from 10 yards for 5-0. Atletico Madrid won 1-0 at PSV in Group D's other game. Kimmich, 21, has now scored his first goal for Germany, first Bayern Munich league goal and first Champions League goal in a 10-day period. After beating the Russian side, Ancelotti, who has won the tournament three times as a manager, said: "Can we win the Champions League? For sure our team will be competitive this season and for the moment everything is good, but the first objective is to win the group, and then we will see the draw." English referee Martin Atkinson ruled out "a good goal", according to PSV boss Phillip Cocu, after Luuk de Jong's fifth-minute effort was disallowed in Eindhoven. Saul Niguez's scissor kick from 18 yards proved decisive for Atletico, who had goalkeeper Jan Oblak to thank for saving Andres Guardado's penalty on the stroke of half-time. In Group B, Anderson Talisca produced a stunning 93rd-minute free-kick to earn Besiktas a 1-1 draw against his parent club Benfica. "It's a draw that feels like a victory," said Besiktas midfielder Ricardo Quaresma. Talisca's strike in Lisbon leaves both sides adrift of Napoli, who came from behind as summer signing Arkadiusz Milik struck twice in nine minutes to overhaul Dynamo Kiev's lead before half-time in Ukraine. The Italian side netted with their only two shots on target against Kiev goalkeeper Oleksandr Shovkovski, who became the second-oldest player in Champions League history at 41 years and 255 days. Ex-Lazio player Marco Ballota remains the oldest at 43 years and 252 days. Bulgarian side Ludogorets - in the Champions League group stage for the second time - faced 14 shots at Basel but left Switzerland with a 1-1 draw, matching the other result in the group between Paris St-Germain and Arsenal in Paris. Barcelona produced the stand-out result of the night as Lionel Messi struck a hat-trick in a 7-0 win over Celtic, while the other fixture in Group C between Manchester City and Borussia Monchengladbach has been rescheduled for Wednesday due to adverse weather.

The medicine does not contain the ingredient that produces the high associated with recreational cannabis. The treatment, called Epidiolex, is based on one of the non-psychoactive components of the cannabis plant, CBD. Early studies in the US have shown treatment with CBD may reduce the frequency and severity of seizures in children with severe forms of epilepsy. The new trial marks the first time the treatment has been tested in the UK. Patients are being enrolled for a trial of the treatment at Edinburgh University's Muir Maxwell Epilepsy Centre, based at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Edinburgh, and Great Ormond Street Hospital. The Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Glasgow and Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool are also driving the study. There are further centres in the US, France and Poland. Their initial focus will be on children with Dravet Syndrome, a rare but serious type of epilepsy that is difficult to treat. Some children will receive the treatment while others will receive a placebo. In a further phase, researchers will also study the effect on children with Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome. Only children whose seizures cannot be controlled with existing medications will take part in the trial. Dravet Syndrome usually takes hold in the first year of life. It causes seizures that are often prolonged, lasting longer than five minutes. They then develop other seizure types. This has a significant impact on the child's development and can be fatal in some cases. Epidiolex has been developed by the British biotechnology company GW Pharmaceuticals, which is sponsoring and funding the trial. Dr Richard Chin, director of the Muir Maxwell Epilepsy Centre, said: "Many children with serious forms of epilepsy do not respond to the medications that we currently have available. "We need new means of treating these conditions so that we can give back some quality of life to these children and their families."	Children with severe epilepsy could be helped by a new treatment derived from the cannabis plant.
Mr de Mistura said the agenda would include the formation of a transitional administration and elections. But it is not clear who will attend the indirect talks in Geneva, with some opposition leaders yet to confirm. On the ground in Syria, a partial truce that began 12 days ago has considerably reduced the intensity of the fighting. Mr de Mistura said the cessation of hostilities was holding "by and large" and was open-ended as far as the UN was concerned. The first round of talks on a political solution to the conflict in Syria was suspended last month while still in the "preparatory" phase, with both sides blaming each other. It came as government forces, backed by Russian air strikes, launched a major offensive on opposition-controlled areas around the northern city of Aleppo. The government succeeded in cutting a key rebel supply route from Turkey to Aleppo before the US and Russia brokered the cessation of hostilities agreement, which does not include the jihadist groups Islamic State (IS) and al-Nusra Front. At a news conference in Geneva on Wednesday, Mr de Mistura welcomed what he described as "a sustained reduction of violence". "Incidents are taking place, no question and they are. I'm expecting even worse incidents to take place, probably caused by spoilers," he added. "The secret will be whether the sides are in a position, as so far touch wood has been the case, [to] contain them, make them not become an unravelling of what has been after five years quite a change... for the life of every Syrian." Mr de Mistura said he expected informal discussions to begin at hotels across Geneva immediately, but that formal talks would not resume until Monday. He added that they would once again be indirect "proximity" talks, with representatives of the warring parties located in separate rooms, and would last only 10 days before pausing for a week. "We believe that having a timetable and a time limit is healthy for everyone so that we don't think that we can go onâ€¦ for two weeks hoping to get into substance - we go seriously into substance as soon as we can." The BBC's Imogen Foulkes in Geneva says the focus of the talks will be a transitional government, a new constitution, and elections. Humanitarian access and ceasefire violations will not be on the agenda. The UN has set up two taskforces to deal with those issues, and clearly wants the opposition and government representatives to concentrate on a political settlement, our correspondent adds. UN aid agencies say good progress has been made getting supplies to besieged areas, with almost 240,000 people reached, most of whom received nothing in the last year. But our correspondent says it remains unclear exactly who will arrive in Geneva on Monday, with some opposition leaders suggesting they have not yet decided whether to attend. Meanwhile, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Raad Al Hussein told the BBC that the international system had failed Syria. "We've seen in this conflict... almost every conceivable war crime allegedly being committed, in addition to crimes against humanity," he said. "What does it say to us? It says... that the international system is incapable of addressing this sort of conflict. So future 'Syrias' - we have no algorithm, no formula, for how we address these conflicts. And it doesn't bode well for the 21st Century, of course," he added.	The UN special envoy to Syria, Staffan de Mistura, expects "substantive, deeper" talks between the government and opposition to begin on Monday.
The supermarket's stock fell by more than 4% to close at 197.8p. Over the weekend, press reports suggested the deal faced a lengthy investigation from competition regulators. Shares in Booker also fell, with the FTSE 250 company down 3.6%. Overall, the FTSE 100 ended down by 66 points at 7,118.48. Most major stock markets around the world fell after President Donald Trump's decision to impose a travel ban on seven Muslim-majority countries. Among the gainers in the UK, Vodafone rose after the mobile phone company said that its Indian unit was in merger talks. A combination of the two companies would create India's biggest telecoms firm. Shares rose 1.3%. On the FTSE 250, shares in WS Atkins jumped 6% following a report in the Times that the engineering company had been approached by US company CH2M over a possible merger. Flybe shares dipped 1.1% after the airline said it had seen a "slow start" to trading since the start of the new year, blaming "uncertain consumer confidence and poor weather". That was despite the carrier reporting "solid" trading for the final three months of 2016, with revenues boosted by extra capacity. Flybe said passenger revenues rose 13.5% in the quarter, compared with 5.7% in the previous six months. On the currency markets, the pound fell 0.5% against the dollar to $1.2484, but rose 0.4% against the euro to 1.1682 euros.	Shares in Tesco led the declines on the FTSE 100, giving up some of Friday's gains when the stock surged in the wake of news of its planned tie-up with food wholesaler Booker.
Knight Frank found transaction volumes in the Granite City fell from over £600m in 2014 to only £55m last year. Investment in offices alone slumped from £500m in 2014 to £30m in 2016. Knight Frank said the low oil price "continued to take its toll" in the north east, with few deals going through in 2016. But it added that market conditions could improve in the year ahead, with crude prices making a recovery. The report found investors spent nearly £1.8bn last year across all sectors in Scotland, including offices, hotels, shops, student accommodation and industrial units. The figure was 12% down on the previous year but above the 10-year average of £1.72bn. Edinburgh registered a particularly strong year for investment, with almost £1.2bn transacted across all sectors - 92.5% up on 2015. But Glasgow saw a "more muted" 12 months, with transaction volumes down by 59% at £280m. Alasdair Steele, from Knight Frank, said: "Overall, the Scottish commercial property market remained resilient, despite an unstable 12 months. "Across the country, political uncertainty has influenced investment levels over the last year. "However, there's a general feeling beginning to emerge that Scotland offers good value and strong fundamentals - an attractive proposition for investors seeking solid returns at an especially turbulent time. "We'd hope to see that reflected in transaction volumes picking up in 2017, provided the political climate remains stable." Meanwhile, a separate report has suggested that investor interest in Scotland's commercial property market has failed to pick up despite an increase in occupier demand. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) said both domestic and foreign investment inquiries stayed in negative territory in the last quarter. At the same time, the supply of property for investment purposes fell across all sectors. Some surveyors described market conditions as "challenging". The latest Rics UK commercial market survey suggested increased demand from occupiers in the office and industrial sectors. But it was a different story for retail in the fourth quarter, with a net balance of 14% more chartered surveyors reporting a fall in demand for retail space. Gavin Anderson, from Montagu Evans in Glasgow, said: "The current economic outlook isn't looking great and consumer spending on the high street is feeling the effect of growing fears about the economy. "Hopefully, the anticipated reduction in the rateable value of retail premises from April 2017 will act as a catalyst to help retailers' profit margins across their shop portfolios and increase their confidence to expand and take more stores next year." Rics chief economist Simon Rubinsohn said: "The results for the survey suggest that the commercial property market in Scotland has failed to attract investor interest despite an increase in occupier demand for commercial property in the last quarter. "This may be due, in part, to the prospects for the economy and the political situation more generally."	Investment in commercial property has plummeted in Aberdeen in the last two years, according to a report by a consultancy.
The 2004 winner, who has battled health and alcohol problems for several years, has not played at Lakeside since 2006 and will not feature there in 2016. Fordham, 53, qualified for the Grand Slam of Darts for the first time but went out of the tournament on Tuesday. "A few people have said about trying to get into the PDC but I'd love to get to Lakeside once more," he told BBC Sport. "I've got grandchildren now and I'd love for them to see it." Fordham lost his opening group match to Adrian Lewis but he then beat Wayne Jones, meaning a 5-2 victory over Michael Smith would have been enough to see him through to the second round. But Smith, currently ninth in the Professional Darts Corporation's Order of Merit, won 5-2 to end Fordham's participation in Wolverhampton. "It's proved a few things for me," Fordham said. "I know I can compete now at a higher level. I want to just keep going forward now. "The crowd have been unbelievable. I've got to thank (chairman) Barry Hearn and the PDC for making the opportunity there for us. If I ever get back, I'll be back like a rocket." BDO world champion Scott Mitchell went into his final group match with no chance of qualifying for the last 16, but he ended his first Grand Slam of Darts appearance with an impressive 5-1 win over Dave Chisnall. "Before I came here I felt I could win two of the games," Mitchell said. "I'm over the moon to win one but of course I'd like to have won two and progressed." After failing to get through a difficult group which also contained Mervyn King and Peter Wright, it was quickly back to reality for the 45-year-old from Bransgore in the New Forest. "I've got to shoot home and cut a couple of football pitches for a couple of youth football teams I help out," he said. "And I've got to mark out five pitches for the weekend, so I'm hoping for no rain. "That's on my mind now - it was probably on my mind before I played 'Chizzy', which probably helped." The Grand Slam is the only major televised event in which players from darts' two rival organisations - the British Darts Organisation and the Professional Darts Corporation - compete against each other. Of the eight BDO players invited to play in the Grand Slam, only Martin Adams made it through to the knockout phase. The three-time world champion beat Ian White, Jelle Klaasen and Steve Beaton to finish top of his group. "I'm very pleased with three out of three," the 59-year-old said. "I've played three great players and I've won each game." Adams had previously turned down invitations to play in the Grand Slam but accepted in 2015 after being asked to compete in Wolverhampton by the BDO. Many expected Adams to receive a rough reception from the audience, but he says that has not been the case. "I enjoy a good crowd and they've been a great crowd, despite what I've heard about on Facebook and despite what I've read on Twitter," he continued. "And I love playing darts. I'm enjoying myself." World number one Michael van Gerwen, world champion Gary Anderson and Phil Taylor all safely made it into the last 16 with three group victories. Defending champion Taylor has won the Grand Slam six times, but Scotland's Anderson and Van Gerwen of the Netherlands have yet to lift the trophy. "I don't think I've ever won my first three games in the Grand Slam," Anderson, 44, said. "Usually I lose the first game and then panic for the next two. "This is my favourite one and, of all the tournaments, this is one I'd like to get my hands on." Second-round ties are longer than group-stage matches, being played over the best of 19 legs rather than the best of nine. Van Gerwen, 26, added: "It gives me great confidence because I'm better in the long formats. "This is the format that I like - first to 10. I'm up for it."	Andy Fordham is hoping for at least one more chance to play in the BDO World Championships.
Kirsty Blackman, SNP MP for Aberdeen North, found a toy rabbit at the Carriage Gates entrance last July. She tried to trace the owner on social media but no-one came forward for months. After turning to Mumsnet, a user got in touch at Hogmanay, saying the toy belonged to her six-year-old daughter. The woman said she worked near Westminster at the time and her daughter was "gutted" when the bunny went missing as they had been "inseparable since birth". She reclaimed the toy on a visit to the House of Commons on Wednesday. Ms Blackman updated followers on the toy's time at Westminster, including pictures of her and the Jellycat Bashful Bunny with Big Ben behind them and at Prime Minister's Questions. She also drafted an Early Day Motion stating the House of Commons is "saddened by the discovery of the abandoned bashful bunny by the gates of the Palace of Westminster" which was not submitted to parliament but was signed by several SNP colleagues. Ms Blackman said previously: "I have two young children, so I know the devastation that can be caused when a toy is lost."	An MP who issued a social medial appeal after discovering a soft toy abandoned outside the House of Commons has reunited it with its young owner.
The US military says a strike targeting Taliban in the northern city of Kunduz may have caused "collateral damage". Offering his "deepest condolences", Mr Obama said he expected a "full accounting of the facts" and would then make a definitive judgement. At least 12 MSF staff members and seven patients were killed in the incident. The UN called the strikes "inexcusable and possibly even criminal", with Secretary General Ban Ki-moon calling for a thorough and impartial investigation. "International and Afghan military planners have an obligation to respect and protect civilians at all times, and medical facilities and personnel are the object of a special protection," said UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Ra'ad Al Hussein Zeid. The hospital, run by the medical charity MSF, was severely damaged by a series of strikes lasting more than an hour from 02:00 local time on Saturday. Dozens were also injured in the attack. MSF president Meinie Nicolai described the incident as "abhorrent and a grave violation of international humanitarian law". "All indications currently point to the bombing being carried out by international Coalition forces," MSF said. A spokesman for US forces in Afghanistan, Col Brian Tribus, said on Saturday that US forces had conducted an air strike in Kunduz "against individuals threatening the force" at the same time. He added: "The strike may have resulted in collateral damage to a nearby medical facility." President Obama expressed his "deepest condolences" for the deaths in a White House statement. He added: "The Department of Defense has launched a full investigation, and we will await the results of that inquiry before making a definitive judgment as to the circumstances of this tragedy." MSF nurse Lajos Zoltan Jecs was sleeping at the facility when it was hit. "It was absolutely terrifying," he said. He saw a fellow nurse "covered in blood, with wounds all over his body", a statement issued by MSF said. Mr Jecs and other staff went outside when the bombing stopped.  "What we saw was the hospital destroyed. We tried to take a look into one of the burning buildings. There are no words for how terrible it was. In the intensive care unit six patients were burning in their beds." The Afghan interior ministry said a group of 10 to 15 militants had been hiding in the hospital. The Taliban denied that any of its fighters were there. A Taliban statement described the air strikes which hit the hospital as "deliberate", and carried out by "the barbaric American forces". There has been intense fighting in Kunduz since Taliban fighters swept into the northern city on Monday.	President Barack Obama says the US has launched a "full investigation" into air strikes that killed 19 people at an MSF-run Afghan hospital on Saturday.
Media playback is not supported on this device Inverness were dominated after the interval with Kane Hemmings eventually cancelling out Ross Draper's opener. "We've got [Owain] Fon-Williams to thank for making three or four wonderful saves to keep us in it," Hughes told BBC Scotland. "We were second to every ball and I'm happy to come away with a point." Dundee recovered from Draper's strike and spent most of the second half in and around the Inverness penalty area as they controlled the game. "You have to be honest," said Hughes. "I felt in the first half the two teams were nip and tuck, we played some nice stuff and got our goal. In the second half it was all Dundee. "My frustration was how Dundee were getting in so easily and I'm really disappointed with the goal that we lost and how it came about. We need to defend that better. "We were second to every ball and that gives the other team the impetus to get on it and play. We just dropped off it, especially in the second half today. It's not a skill or a technique thing, it's a mental thing." Dundee manager Paul Hartley, meanwhile, felt that his side created enough chances in the second half to win the game comfortably, and he praised his players for remaining patient as they pushed for an equaliser, even as Hemmings, Rory Loy and Greg Stewart all missed a series of chances. "In the first 10 minutes we didn't start that well but in the second half we were terrific," said Hartley. "We could have won that game 5-1, we had some fantastic chances and on another day you bank on Stewart and Hemmings scoring more than that given they chances they got. "But the team kept going and I thought we were brilliant in the second half, some of our passes and combinations. "You've got the give the [Inverness] goalkeeper credit, he made some great saves, but we kept going, we never gave in and I've got a smashing bunch of lads. "[The battle to finish in the top six] is exciting, there's not a lot between the clubs. We've got a big week coming up, a real testing week for the club, the players and myself, and it's a week we want to do well in."	Inverness CT manager John Hughes admits Dundee "did enough" to defeat his side at Dens Park and that his own team did not merit more than a point.
The prince was welcomed to the village of Surama in the Iwokrama rainforest with a feathered headdress, before he watched a cultural dance around a pole. He met rangers to learn about the steps being taken to protect the rainforest and the benefits of eco-tourism. Prince Harry later visited a school and the Kaieteur Falls - one of the world's largest freefall waterfalls. On the penultimate day of his Caribbean tour, the prince took a flight to the Iwokrama International Centre which has a close link to the Prince of Wales, who has been its patron since 2000. He then visited Fairview village to pay his respects to its elders, as well as going to the local school. The prince was also taken to an open-air community hall, where he was given presents including a painting of traditional homes. He gave a speech which praised the people of the remote community, saying: "My father told me what an amazing time he had here, when he was far younger and had far more hair. "The positive thing you are doing here, it's incredible, your leadership is so important to ensure the protection of this place." The final stop of the day was the Kaieteur Falls, which has a drop of 250 metres - five times as high as Niagara Falls. Earlier in the week, the prince met Barbados's biggest star, Rihanna, when the pair sat side by side at a celebratory concert. They also both took part in a HIV test to highlight World Aids Day in Bridgetown. Guyana is the only English-speaking country in South America. Between 1780 and 1813, Guyana changed hands between the Dutch, French and British.

The treatment isn't offered on the NHS, but it's understood some staff have occasionally put patients in touch with organisations who provide it. Experts say attempting so-called "gay cures" can be "dangerous" and "damaging". Fourteen organisations, including NHS England, have signed an agreement to stop gay conversion therapy being offered to patients. Although in general, referrals to conversion services are rare - there is evidence that GPs, counsellors and psychotherapists have made them. They will also be providing training for staff to enable them to improve support available to lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) people seeking advice. The agreement, The Memorandum of Understanding on Conversion Therapy in the UK, makes it clear that NHS England, the organisation which has day-to-day responsibility for running the NHS, "does not endorse or support conversion therapy" and will make this clear to staff. It essentially means GPs will not be able to refer patients for gay therapy and that no-one employed by the NHS can provide it. Amber Dowell, communications officer at the UK Council for Psychotherapy, told Newsbeat the agreement was "really important". "It's very common for people to have feelings where they might question their sexuality, where they might want to explore the attractions they're feeling. "We want people to be able to do that in an environment that is safe, supportive and free of judgement." There are no official figures for how many people attempt conversion therapy every year, but the Department of Health has acknowledged to Newsbeat it does occasionally happen. Amber suggested that an "ignorance of the issue of the ethics involved" rather than staff being "prejudiced against LGB people" was to blame for it being offered by the NHS in the past. "I think, in trying to help people mistakenly, referrals had been made in the past," she said. Newsbeat has spoken to people who said they had experienced conversion therapy. Louise from West Yorkshire said she was blackmailed into receiving "treatment" for being gay in 2007 by her evangelical church. She later attended group sessions of around 20 women near Liverpool. "[Most] were married with children. They were there without the knowledge of their partners or their children. "If I'd been more impressionable I think I could have been really damaged by the process." Brad, from Illinois, lives in the West Midlands. He said he was "scared" when he first discovered he was gay and "wanted to do my very best to change it". He attended group therapy sessions but realised the treatment, which he said encouraged him "to do more stereotypical masculine things" wasn't going to change his feelings. "It's really sad I spent three years of my life trying to do something that was impossible." There are some who suggest it works and insist people should be able to try it. Mike Davidson told Newsbeat he "converted" with therapy over the course of two years and now provides what he calls "support" for people who have "unwanted same-sex attraction" in Northern Ireland. He thinks the service should be allowed but he wasn't able to give an accurate estimate of how widely the treatment was available. He told Newsbeat that gay conversion isn't a "huge industry" and that the people he works with have decided it is something they want to do. "By the time they [clients] get to us, they know what we're about and know what they would like to achieve." Explaining the process, he said: "For some people they want to go as far as controlling their behaviour... they do not want to act out on those issues and we would support them." He also said that he turns people away who appear to have been pressured into taking therapy and admitted that, even when working with someone who wants to change their sexual feelings, a "result" is never guaranteed. The UK Council of Psychotherapy says it intends to expand the agreement to Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland soon.

Born in Bradford, Appleyard did not make his first-class debut until he was 27, but took 200 wickets in his first season in 1951. He made his Test debut in 1954 and had match figures of 7-123 in a victory over Pakistan at Trent Bridge. Appleyard retired from playing in 1958 and went on to serve a two-year term as club president between 2006 and 2008. During his career, he took 642 wickets at an average of 15.42 for Yorkshire, and 31 in nine Tests for England. Appleyard was named as one of  Wisden's cricketers of the year in 1952 and appointed an MBE in 2007.	Former Yorkshire and England off-spinner Bob Appleyard MBE has died at the age of 90.
The two-time Australian Open champion, who gave birth to Leo in December, won 6-3 4-6 7-6 (9-7) against Japan's Risa Ozaki at the Mallorca Open. It was the 27-year-old Belarusian's first match since losing at the French Open in June 2016. Azarenka was sixth in the world when she announced her pregnancy last July. She was a game away from defeat when play was suspended on Tuesday because of fading light. Find out how to get into tennis in our special guide. But she showed her trademark resilience to twice break 74th-ranked Ozaki's serve when they returned on Wednesday, then going on to fight back from 5-3 down in the tie-break. Azarenka was given a wildcard to play in the Mallorca Open, which is scheduled to be her only competitive action before Wimbledon. The former Wimbledon quarter-finalist has used her protected ranking to play at the All England Club in the tournament which starts on 3 July.	Former world number one Victoria Azarenka saved three match points before winning on her comeback from a year out after the birth of her son.
Two Jesse Sene-Lefao tries got the Tigers on the way after Leigh had one of three scores ruled out by the video referee, before Eden cut loose. All four of his tries were created by the potent left-side combination of Luke Gale and Michael Shenton. Jake Webster added a seventh Tigers try, their 101st league score of 2017. Since these two teams met on the opening weekend of the season, Daryl Powell's Castleford have proved to be the stand-out team in the division, and showed hallmarks of that quality to dispatch the Centurions - who have struggled since a bright start. Leigh were not disgraced by their performance and had plenty of ball but defence has been a major improvement for the Tigers, who have the best record in the division. Discipline did not help them, as Cas loanee Ben Crooks went to the sin-bin for a dangerous tackle call and the Tigers scored in his absence. However, it is Castleford's attacking menace which has caught the eye most and they were at their best, through the influential England half-back Gale in particular. Sene-Lefao took his personal tally to six for the season but Eden is now just 14 tries behind last season's Super League record-breaking winger Denny Solomona with 14 games of the season left to play. Castleford coach Daryl Powell: "I thought we were superb in the second 20 minutes of the first half. We defended well all the way through but made too many errors when we got in attacking positions early on. "To nil a team is very difficult to do and we showed some last-ditch stuff there which shows the character in the team. We have done that twice now this season and they are big results for us. "I thought our attitude was outstanding, given we've just had the second ridiculous short turnaround this season. It's crazy how that has been put together. "The boys have put a lot of emphasis on defence this year and they were delighted to keep a clean sheet." Leigh: McNally; Dawson, Crooks, Fleming, Brown; Reynolds, Drinkwater; Acton, Hood, Burr, Paterson, Vea, Stewart. Replacements: Pelissier, Tickle, Maria, Hopkins. Castleford: Hardaker; Minikin, Webster, Shenton, Eden; Roberts, Gale,; Millington, McShane, Massey, Sene-Lefao, McMeeken, Milner. Replacements: Moors, Cook, T Holmes, Larroyer. Referee: Chris Kendall (RFL).	Greg Eden kept up his phenomenal scoring record for Super League leaders Castleford with a fourth hat-trick in a row to help beat Leigh.
Judge Clifford Bellamy said Leicester City Council had not undertaken a "robust risk assessment" of the boy's great-great-uncle who had been jailed for sexual abuse. The city's family court heard the nine-year-old had a "complex" home life. The judge said the boy should be placed into foster care. A city council spokesman said the child has already been moved to an "appropriate placement." The judge explained in a written ruling the boy's mother had mental health problems and separated from his father several years ago and was now in a lesbian relationship. His father has dwarfism, an alcohol problem and had been convicted of having unlawful sex with a 16-year-old girl when he was 21. Updates from this story and more from Leicestershire The boy had been living in the care of his great-great-uncle, who was in his 70s, who had been given an eight-year jail term in the early 1990s. He had admitted unlawful sexual intercourse and a serious sexual offence with his niece when she was aged between 11 and 13. Judge Bellamy said the man had been released on licence after serving five years and was assessed as "low risk". The concerns were raised after the judge was asked to make decisions about the long-term future of the boy at the hearing. He said the council had lacked "any sense of urgency" in bringing the case to the attention of a family court judge. A city council spokesman said: "This case does not appear to have been handled appropriately, or with the urgency required, and our own review is under way. "We have already put in place new systems to improve and oversee the way assessments are carried out, and further work is under way to ensure court proceedings are expedited." The judge also ruled that none of those involved in the case could be identified.	Social services staff have been criticised after a boy spent two years living with a relative who was a convicted paedophile.
The four are now in police custody, after a crime spree that included raids on hotels, small shops and amusement arcades, Italian media report. On one occasion they allegedly raced off in a Porsche Cayenne after pointing a pistol in the driver's face. The gang reportedly boasted of their crimes in video clips on social media. They stole cash, smartphones, tablets and even on one occasion a youth's luxury shoes worth â‚¬530 (Â£465; $601), according to police. The crimes took place in Milan's Quarto Oggiaro district. Two of the young suspects are Italians aged 14 and 16, the others are of foreign origin, aged 15 and 17. They came from broken homes and are thought to have been controlled by an Egyptian man, aged 23. He is under arrest on a drugs charge and was convicted for previous offences. Police found that the youths - dubbed a "baby gang" in Italian media - possessed several firearms, including a pump-action shotgun. Italy's Rai news website said investigators "stressed that the baby gang used brutal violence on their victims in the style of A Clockwork Orange". One victim, a young man attacked in the street, was pistol-whipped and needed 10 stitches for a deep wound. The 1971 film A Clockwork Orange, directed by Stanley Kubrick, was a box-office hit. Based on a futuristic novel by Anthony Burgess, it portrayed a gang of juvenile delinquents who made a cult of gratuitous violence.	Italian police say four teenagers accused of 12 robberies in Milan gloried in violence like the notorious gang in the film A Clockwork Orange.

Ma Filleule (5-1) was second with 5-2 favourite Don Cossack third. McCoy said: "I would love to say it's a relief, but I actually got such a thrill riding him." The Northern Irishman did not seem to fancy his chances much pre-race, but trainer King's seven-year-old put in some spectacular leaps on the way round. "I was actually thinking I wouldn't mind riding the horse in next year's Champion Chase," said McCoy after his victory. "He ran away with me for a mile and a half and I thought he would never keep it up but I was quite happy coming down the hill." McCoy's wife Chanelle and several of his family members were waiting in the winner's enclosure to greet him after his victory. "He wanted that feeling one more time," said Chanelle. "Heading into day three he wanted one more time to ride a winner at Cheltenham, to soak up the atmosphere and not finish his career without one more winner."	AP McCoy won his first race of his final Cheltenham Festival on day three, riding Uxizandre to victory in the Ryanair Chase.
The death toll doubled over the last two days as officials found more than 100 bodies once waters began receding. Officials estimate that the floods have affected 450,000 people in the state. This years monsoon rains have affected millions across at least 20 states in India. The north-eastern state of Assam has also seen dozens killed and hundreds of thousands displaced. The government has announced aid packages for affected areas and Prime Minister Narendra Modi is due to visit Assam on Tuesday. He has said the aim of his visit is to find a "permanent solution" to the flooding that Assam faces every year. The Press Trust of India news agency quoted an official as saying that many affected people in Gujarat had begun returning to their villages.	Floods in the western Indian state of Gujarat have killed 218 people, government officials have confirmed.

Yet the sophisticated image of the Grand National is far removed from the images in newspapers the day after of women falling over, or with underwear showing after being caught by gusts of wind. It is something that Liverpool women academics, stylists and commentators are tired of, and the fight back has begun. Liverpool fashion student Hannah Ramsay, who now lives in London, said that people there regard her accent as something "hysterically funny". She wrote a paper on the north-south fashion divide as part of her degree course. "I think the gap is closing between the north and the south in terms of fashion," she said. "There are always going to be people who want to do Liverpool down and resort to stereotypes no matter what we do, there are people who want to rip it to shreds." She said she will not go to Ladies' Day as she does not want to judge other people subconsciously. "People in Liverpool do want to look good and not adhere to the norm," she added. Gemma Ahearne, a sociology and criminology lecturer and PhD student, said the negative coverage is part of the "vilification of the working classes", who are "not regarded as being worthy of being at the races". She used Aintree as a case study when she examined how the media portrays women and she believes it targets women and defines them as "Chavs" who are held up as "defective" and to be mocked. Ms Ahearne said: "I don't go to the National as it's cruel to the horses, but I have friends who go and hate how women are treated and portrayed as caricatures," she said. She believes the media are "misogynistic and disapproving of women who are hyper-confident, and such coverage aims to regulate their behaviour". "The comments below the line on these articles are disgusting and you get a differentiation at Cheltenham and Ascot, where the language and semantics talks of fashionable fillies," she added. Jennina O'Neill, manager of the Met Quarter shopping district in Liverpool, said it was disappointing the press focus on the same stereotypes year after year. She said: "It's important to celebrate individuality, but the focus should be on style, it would be nice to see more stories showcasing some of the great looks at the races." Interestingly, she does not believe it has a major impact on the city as she said "every city has to deal with certain stereotypes." She agreed that women in Merseyside take pride in their appearance, but said there were lots of different looks in the city. "One thing we notice from our shoppers is the appetite for individuality", she added. Andy Heath, the deputy managing director of Merseyrail, said they had seen a marked change in the behaviour of racegoers - for the better - over the last four or five years. "There is a well-trodden stereotype of Ladies' Day that people turn up in their finery and stagger out at the end of the day," Mr Heath said. Merseyside Police Supt Paul Wilson said anti-social behaviour would not be tolerated and he asked people to treat the area with respect. Last year, there were just 16 arrests during the three-day festival - five on Ladies' Day. None were women, the force said. Merseyrail has introduced bylaws that prevent people who are extremely intoxicated travelling. Music is played and coffee sold in pop-up stores to create a good atmosphere. Over the three days, Mr Heath said the rail company transports 100,000 people - half on Saturday and 30,000 on Ladies' Day. Trains double in frequency to every seven minutes and 12,000 flip-flops are handed out. The flip-flop giveaway also prevents escalator accidents at Liverpool stations, Mr Heath added. While not denying that people may indulge too much, he said they were "a very small minority." "You don't get this sort of publicity at other events such as York or Ascot," he added. "It's a very jaundiced and unfair reflection on women in Liverpool."	It is a day when women from Merseyside are encouraged to dress in their finest clothes and enjoy a day at the races at Ladies' Day.
The force said paedophile hunter activities can hinder investigations and lead to offenders walking free. Det Ch Supt Tom Richards of Kent Police said it also diverts resources away from cases involving real children. Kent group The Hunted One said: "Police should concern themselves more with tackling paedophiles than us." But Mr Richards said: "There have been zero cases in Kent where a vigilante paedophile hunter group has identified an individual who has at that stage presented a real risk to a real child. "In the last two financial years, vigilante groups in Kent have contributed to 20 individuals being arrested but my resources alone in the same period have arrested 299 people." Professor Martin Gill, a criminologist working for Perpetuity Research, said: "There is nothing worse than a police investigation to get to its crescendo and then be undermined by an often well-intentioned but disastrous intervention." The Hunted One claims to have caught 57 people, leading to 27 convictions. In October last year, Mark McKenna from Northfleet was jailed for five years after he was snared by The Hunted One. The 38 year-old thought he was meeting an 11-year-old girl for sex at Bluewater Shopping Centre in Kent. But instead of talking to a vulnerable child online, he was speaking to the group of concerned parents. Ben Bleach of The Hunted One said he could not understand why "a child has to be raped" before action is taken.	Vigilante groups seeking to expose paedophiles should stop taking the law into their own hands, Kent Police has said.
Musgrove Park Hospital said the cause of the "technical issues" in the hired facility was being investigated. Surgery was carried out on 62 patients with just under half reporting complications while some 15 people had "more significant" corneal issues. The use of the mobile facility was ceased when the issues were discovered. All affected patients have been spoken to and care plans are now in place for their ongoing treatment, a hospital spokesperson said. Vanguard Healthcare had been hired to provide the theatre to help clear a backlog for some ophthalmic services. The unit, which consists of an anaesthetic room, operating theatre and two-bed recovery, is at the hospital until the end of the year. Vanguard said it was "co-operating fully" with the hospital for the investigation which would focus on the drugs, equipment, sterilisation and protocols used. "The majority of operations were successful, however a number experienced an unusual level of discomfort after surgery," added a spokesperson. "We have, with the hospital, conveyed to the patients our concern and sympathy for the discomfort or distress they have experienced." The hospital's chief executive, Jo Cubbon, said the issues meant many patients who had already waited longer than they should have, will now have to wait again for their operation. "We are very sorry this has happened and are working to put a solution in place so that these patients will receive their treatment as soon as possible," Ms Cubbon said.	About 30 patients in Somerset who had cataract surgery inside a mobile hospital theatre have been left with blurred vision or other complications.
The proposal concerns routes that make up the Belfast Rapid Transit (BRT) plan. Currently bus lanes in Belfast run from 07:30 until 09:30 and from 15:30 until 18:30. Under the proposals this would be extended from 07:00 to 19:00. The project is due to come into operation in September 2018. "We should remember in 2012 the business case for the Belfast Rapid Transit was built upon the concept that these would be 12-hour, seven-to-seven bus lane priorities," said Mr Hazzard. "That is so we can have maximum compliance and avoid confusion." West Belfast East Belfast Titanic Quarter Mr Hazzard said there would be two rounds of consultation on the proposals and said there could be some room for flexibility. "What we can do and looking at other cities - Dublin for example - we may have loading and unloading windows and drop-off and pick-up times, where you have windows into that," he said. "This is through consultation with those commuters, with those stakeholders and the community along the route so we can design our proposals and then go to a formal consultation period after." He added: "These buses and vehicles will be coming across every seven minutes in and out of the city, it's so, so important that we get this right."	Transport Minister Chris Hazzard is proposing to extend the times of bus lanes on some of Belfast's busiest commuting routes.
The government has been accused of failing to do more to help 2.6 million women born in the 1950s who have lost out because of changes to pension law. The SNP's Mhairi Black said it was "laughable" the problem could not be fixed when the government had found £1bn to fund its deal with the DUP. Minister Guy Opperman said he would look at cases of financial hardship. But he faced shouts of "shame on you" when he said the government was "actually doing a significant amount" to address the individual difficulties of older workers trying to enter the labour market - including by offering them apprenticeships. Mr Opperman, setting out the government's work on "lifelong learning" said: "The reality is over 200,000 people over 60 have entered further education since 2014/15. "We have also extended apprenticeship opportunities as one of the best routes to skilled employment for people of all ages and gender. "Such apprenticeships in England, for example, in 2014/15... 12% of the starting apprenticeships were for those aged 45." Mr Opperman was heckled by MPs as he outlined the details. Labour's Graham Jones, raising a point of order, said: "I'm struggling to hear the debate, did the minister just say that women aged 64 could go on an apprenticeship course?" The debate centred on the plight of the so-called Waspi women - Women Against State Pension Inequality - whose aim is to achieve fair transitional arrangements for women born in the 1950s, for whom the state pension age is being raised from 60 to 66 by 2020. Ms Black said she had been contacted by a woman who said her friend had committed suicide after the general election result "because she could not face what was going to happen to her". "Citizens committing suicide over an issue that could be solved like that - an issue the government could do a U-turn on at any given moment," she said. Ms Black said it was "an absolute disgrace" that a debate on the issue was having to be held again. Turning to Mr Opperman, a pensions minister, she said it was "laughable" that the government "can find a billion pounds for a deal to cling on to power, but we cannot find the money to give women the pensions that they are due". "The only other two things they are guilty of is being born in the 50s and the fact they are women." Labour's Carolyn Harris said the government "has betrayed these women - they've stolen their security and they've shattered their dreams without time to prepare and make the necessary alternative arrangements".	A minister has been heckled by MPs for suggesting women over 60 facing poverty could start an apprenticeship.
The report focuses on the impact of sea level rises on the Dawlish to Teignmouth line which connects Cornwall and Devon to the rest of the UK. The line was closed for two months in 2014 after it was destroyed by storms. Network Rail said the study would be "key" to long-term developments. The report, published in the Journal of Transport Geography, said that 10% of journeys on the line, which was rebuilt and reopened in April 2014, could be affected by 2040. The report said adverse weather disrupted the line about 10 days per year, but according to sea-level predictions that could rise to almost 40 by 2040 and up to 120 by 2100. Academics from Plymouth University, the University of Leeds and the University of York identified a link between sea-level change and rail incidents over the last 150 years. The academics said there could be similar implications for other vulnerable stretches of railway throughout Wales, south-east England, the Cumbrian coast and Scotland. Dr David Dawson, from the University of Leeds, said the long-term future of the line was "really worrying". The report predicts diverting routes could potentially cost billions of pounds. Network Rail said it hoped to develop "long-term interventions" to "secure the future" of the line. The Department for Transport said it had invested Â£31m into improving the resilience of the route and was "exploring the potential for longer-term improvements in the area". In January, the prime minister backed a new Okehampton railway route as the "most resilient" alternative to the vulnerable Dawlish line.	Climate change could disrupt up to a third of rail services travelling to and from the South West within the next 100 years, a study suggests.
Environment body Natural Resources Wales (NRW) said staff were erecting temporary flood barriers and carrying out other prevention work. An amber "be prepared" warning for persistent rain is in place for Gwynedd, Conwy and Denbighshire. The Met Office said up to 15cm (6ins) of rain could fall in north Wales. A yellow "be ready" warning is also in place for Ceredigion, Conwy, Denbighshire, Flintshire, Gwynedd, Anglesey, Powys and Wrexham. NRW  has issued river flood alerts due to rising levels caused by continuous rain since Friday. It said people should be prepared for flooding and it was monitoring the Dyfi, Elwy, Conwy and Vyrnwy river catchments. Scott Squires, of NRW, said: "Our staff are out working putting measures in place to prepare for flooding. This includes erecting temporary flood barriers to protect areas at risk in St Asaph and Llanrwst."	Work is being carried out to try to prevent flooding in parts of north Wales as heavy rainfall is forecast to continue into Sunday.
On Tuesday Mr Obama cancelled planned talks after the firebrand Mr Duterte called him the "son of a whore". Wednesday's informal meeting took place before an Asean summit gala dinner. While a Philippine spokesman said he was "very happy" it happened, the US side said they had a "brief discussion" in a pre-meal "hold space" for leaders. Mr Obama and Mr Duterte are said to have entered the dinner venue separately at the summit in Laos and did not interact with each other during the event, which lasted one hour and 20 minutes. "They were the last people to leave the holding room. I can't say how long they met," Philippine Foreign Secretary Perfecto Yasay, travelling with Mr Duterte, told reporters shortly afterwards. "I'm very happy that it happened." A White House official said the pair exchanged "pleasantries" in a "brief discussion" before dinner. War on drugs Mr Duterte's outburst came after at a press conference where he told reporters he would not accept Mr Obama raising any concerns about the war on drugs in the Philippines. "You must be respectful. Do not just throw away questions and statements. Son of a whore, I will curse you in that forum," Mr Duterte said, apparently in reference to the US president. What else has the controversial Filipino president said? Summit diplomacy, Duterte-style World leaders' offensive insults: Who's top? From 'Punisher' to president: Who is Rodrigo Duterte? The  Filipino leader later expressed regret over the remarks, but not before Mr Obama had cancelled a planned meeting. Mr Duterte won the presidency with his hard-line policy to eradicate drugs and some 2,400 people have died in anti-drug operations since he took office in June. He had previously urged citizens to shoot to kill drug dealers who resisted arrest, and threatened to "separate" from the UN after it called his war on drugs a crime under international law. President Duterte, known for his controversial remarks, had previously called US Secretary of State John Kerry "crazy" and referred to Pope Francis as the "son of a whore". But the president also has staunch support at home for his hardline position on drugs.	US President Barack Obama and Philippine leader Rodrigo Duterte had a brief face-to-face encounter, days after a very public spat.
The trip includes a birthday barbeque in Western Australia for the heir to the British throne, who is turning 67. The pair will also meet new Australian PM Malcolm Turnbull, once the public face of the country's republican movement. Their 12-day tour will take in 12 different towns and cities across Australia and New Zealand. Charles and Camilla arrive in the New Zealand capital Wellington on 4 November. They will then travel around Australia between 10 and 15 November, visiting Adelaide and Tanunda, Canberra, Sydney, Albany and Perth. It will be the 15th time the Prince of Wales has visited Australia. His son Prince William and his wife Kate proved a hit with Australians when they visited last year to show off their baby son.	Prince Charles and his wife Camilla are to visit Australia and New Zealand in November, his office says.

City thought a £40m deal had been agreed for the Argentine striker after he told the Premier League outfit he wanted to return to South America. But Corinthians said there was not enough time to sign the the 27-year-old before the Brazilian transfer window closes at 0400 BST on Thursday. Corinthians still want Tevez and hinted an agreement can be reached in January. It had appeared that the former West Ham forward had got his wish for a transfer but then in a statement, Corinthians said: "The board of Sporting Club Corinthians hereby officially announce the impossibility of hiring the Argentine striker Carlos Tevez. "While acknowledging the efforts of Manchester City and all involved in the negotiation, more time is needed for the transfer to be achieved, given that the window to sign players from abroad closes on Wednesday, 20 July [Brazilian time]. "We are aware of the dream our fans had of having this player at Corinthians again and we look forward to him being with us in the near future." That would indicate that Corinthians may look to revive the deal in the January transfer window, although that would not be the preferred option of Tevez or his current club. Tevez, who had a spell at Corinthians from 2005 to 2006, originally asked City for a transfer in December and has since reiterated that desire to leave so he can be closer to his family in Argentina. However, there are few clubs who can match the asking price of about £40m. Corinthians' move for Tevez - which emerged on Monday - was believed to be funded by a new television deal for Brazilian clubs. But the Sao Paulo side's response to City's demand for a proper payment schedule on Tuesday was perhaps a sign the transfer would not have gone smoothly. The breakdown of Tevez's transfer to Corinthians also leaves City manager Roberto Mancini's proposed move for Atletico Madrid striker Sergio Aguero in doubt. Tevez, who is contracted to City until 2014, has been a key player for the club since arriving from neighbours Manchester United in 2009. He helped Mancini's side to FA Cup success and Champions League qualification in the 2010/2011 campaign. He has scored 43 Premier League goals in his two seasons at City - the highest total of any player in the top division.	Carlos Tevez's move from Manchester City to Corinthians has fallen through because the Brazilian club pulled out.
Those with mental health or neurological conditions were least likely to have developed ways of living with their illness. A study of 15,687 adults has been analysed at Heriot-Watt University. The Welsh government said it was working with charities on a patient guide for those with chronic illnesses. The study, published in the International Journal of Cardiology and based on research in 2012, found: Chronic illnesses affect an estimated 800,000 people in Wales and are a growing problem for the NHS as the population gets older. Dr Ivy Shiue, assistant professor of environmental health at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh, said people who had not learnt to live with symptoms experienced worse quality of life and the risks were especially high for those with mental health conditions. "These patients may start to lose hope and their sense of identity, ultimately leading to a feeling of fear, hopelessness and despair at their condition," she said. CASE STUDY: Lisa Welch, from Cwmfelinfach, Caerphilly County, has suffered with depression but got help through a self-management programme and mental health charity Gofal. "I've had mental health problems for 19 years but it got worse. I had a bad divorce and I couldn't cope. I wouldn't get dressed, I wouldn't go out, wash or shower, it all spiralled out of control from there and it made me feel worse. "I just didn't want to be here. But I have two boys and that kept me going." "It was only when I had rent arrears and then I was offered help and got introduced to Gofal. Dealing with my bills with the help of my support worker was a big weight off my shoulders." The Welsh government said people living with long-term health conditions could benefit from working with medical professionals to help manage their health and wellbeing. "This can also help to inform them about the support available to them from both the NHS and voluntary organisations," said a spokesperson. A guide for patients is also being developed with the Long Term Conditions Alliance Cymru.	Nearly a third of adults in Wales are struggling to cope with the pain and symptoms of long-term health conditions, according to a new study.

Easyjet was down 3% and IAG down 2.4%. Madame Tussuad owner Merlin also fell 2.4%. The wider FTSE 100 closed slightly lower, slipping 0.3% to 7525.55. Ocado shares closed down 1.7% despite the online retailer securing its first overseas deal to set up an online grocery service for a European retailer. Ocado's shares had initially greeted the news with a 7% surge. Ocado, which had originally pledged an overseas deal by the end of 2015, did not name the retailer or say how much the contract was worth. Ocado's shares have risen by 37% in the past two months and Neil Wilson, analyst at spread betting firm ETX Capital, said the drop could be linked to investors deciding to take profits. However, he said it was still unclear what value the deal would bring to Ocado. "We don't even know who the company is - Ocado simply dubs it a 'regional' retailer (not a national one). This is progress after a lot of promises, but it's not exactly like doing a deal with Wal-Mart - yet," he said. Old Mutual was among the biggest risers, gaining 2.4% The firm was continuing to gain from Friday's announcement that the firm's wealth management arm had snapped up the financial adviser network Caerus Capital Group. Mining stocks were among the top losers with Antofagasta down 3.6%. The pound was up 0.25% against the dollar at $1.2926 and 0.55% higher against the euro at 1.1487 euros.	Shares in Easyjet and BA owner IAG both closed lower in the wake of Sunday's assaults in London.
The 27-year-old Israeli international joins from Ashdod for an undisclosed fee, after spending last season on loan at Easter Road. "It was not so easy, but I'm happy to get it done finally," Marciano told Hibs TV. "My first season was hard and I didn't really know what Hibs means, but it was an amazing experience." Marciano made 28 appearances for Hibs last season as the Edinburgh club secured their return to the top-flight by winning the Championship. He is the club's fourth signing of the summer - after Efe Ambrose, Danny Swanson and Simon Murray - and will compete with Ross Laidlaw for the starting goalkeeper slot in the Premiership this season. "I wanted to become a better player when I came here and I think I did that," Marciano said. "That's why I wanted to come back to Hibs - because I have everything here to be a better player. "And of course the fans are amazing and it's a privilege to play in front of them every week."	Hibernian have completed the permanent signing of goalkeeper Ofir Marciano on a four-year contract.
Sredojevic, who on Sunday lead the Cranes to their first Africa Cup of Nations finals since 1978, complained on social media about not being paid. Fufa admits it owes the coach and says paying him is a priority. The association added it is meeting with the coach to resolve the issues. Fufa also explained that much of its recent income had been used to ensure the "the success of the team" in their final must-win Nations Cup qualifier against Comoros. The statement continued: "Fufa is committed to ensuring all his salary arrears are cleared and we are confident this will be handled." The coach has also said that he is prepared to take the matter to football's world governing body Fifa if necessary.	The Federation of Uganda Football Associations (Fufa) has said that it is working on clearing the salary arrears owed to the national team coach Milutin 'Micho' Sredojevic.
The 36-year-old was sacked from his first managerial post at League One club Oldham in January after just 20 games in charge. Former midfielder Dunn, who won one England cap in 2002, joined Rovers aged eight and made 377 appearances in two spells at Ewood Park. "I don't have to say how much this club means to me," he told the club website. "I think everyone knows what Blackburn Rovers means to me personally. "I'm looking forward to learning from the manager, as well as Alan Irvine and Rob Kelly who are some of the best coaches around." Meanwhile, Blackburn boss Paul Lambert has called for a winter break to be introduced into English football. The 46-year-old made five changes for the FA Cup loss to West Ham and then six changes for Wednesday's defeat by Derby as they have a run of 10 games in 32 days. "I would have it," Lambert told BBC Radio Lancashire when asked about the break. "I've experienced it and I know it's brilliant. "It's really refreshing, you go away and you come back and you've done another pre-season. "It gives everyone so much recovery from long-term injuries, for people mentally and it gives everyone a break."	David Dunn has returned to Blackburn Rovers to take up a position as Under-21 assistant coach.
Glass Butter Beach was supposed to run from Friday to Sunday at Abersoch, Gwynedd. But organisers have cancelled Saturday's event due to "extremely severe weather conditions." A yellow "be aware" warning is in place for every council area in Wales until 21:00 BST Saturday with heavy showers expected. A message on Glass Butter Beach's Facebook page on Saturday said: "In light of today's extremely severe weather conditions, we are unable to open the main arena and the festival for today has unfortunately been cancelled." The programme is set to go ahead as planned on Sunday. Saturday tickets will be valid for Sunday's programme. The Met Office warned gusts of up to 60 mph could hit most of Wales on Saturday. Coastal areas face the strongest winds, which will bring large waves in the most exposed places. Flood alerts for Pembrokeshire, Ceredigion, Carmarthenshire and Swansea are also in place, with high tides predicted to last from Friday to Monday. In Swansea, the Ride with the Pros cycle event has been cancelled because of the weather.	A three-day music festival has cancelled its Saturday programme due to strong winds and heavy rain.
Chisora rocked Fury in the second round with a left and two further rights but it was the only time the champion looked like he might win the fight. Fury, 23, looked fresh throughout and picked his opponent off at ease to earn a wide unanimous decision. Two judges scored the fight 117-112 with the other scoring it 118-111. "This is a dream come true and it means the world to me," said Fury. Victory for the unbeaten Fury -  the 15th of his professional career  - could now open the door to a potential world title shot against either of the Klitschko brothers. Wladimir Klitschko, WBO, IBF and WBA champion, openly discussed the prospect of facing the winner in the build-up to the Wembley Arena showdown, and now Fury can dream of a shot at the big time. This is a dream come true and it means the world to me Chisora has had two proposed bouts with Ukrainian Klitschko cancelled within the past eight months but he looked a long way short of a fighter ready to mix in such exulted company. Manchester's Fury started the fight on the front foot and looking sharper than 27-year-old Chisora, who looked rusty and like a boxer that had not fought for nearly a year. And certainly Chisora's pre-fight weight of 18st 9lb - the heaviest of his career - seemed to suggest the Finchley-based boxer had taken a less than professional approach to training for the fight. It was the Fury jab that proved the most effective punch, with his short clubbing left also finding the target throughout. The previously unbeaten Chisora rocked Fury in the second and had his man in trouble in the third and fourth but the challenger cleared his head and dominated from there on in. Fury boxed well throughout, throwing some beautiful combinations while never looking like ending the fight early, with Chisora cutting a battered, bloodied and disheartened figure as the fight wore on. At one stage his corner threatened to pull Chisora out of the fight in an attempt to spark him into life, but it made little difference. He was constantly worn down by Fury's physical dominance and relentless work rate and despite a 30-second burst from Chisora in the 10th, he never looked liked turning the fight around. The champion knew he needed a stoppage in the final round but he lacked energy and intensity as Fury managed to keep the disappointing Chisora at length to take the fight and British and Commonwealth titles on points. Ashley Theophane overcame a difficult start to stop Welsh veteran Jason Cook in the 10th round of the first defence of his British light-welterweight title at Wembley Arena. Cook, whose career record slips to a potentially final 28-4-1, unsettled the Londoner early on with some intelligent pressure fighting and Theophane's frustration was clear when he was docked a point for low blows in round five. But the champion, now 30-4-1, regrouped, finding his range with a number of sharp combinations before flooring his foe conclusively with a left hook to the body in round 10.	Tyson Fury defeated Dereck Chisora on points to become the new British and Commonwealth heavyweight champion after a brutal fight at Wembley Arena.
Josh Earnest said the closure of the Cuban detention camp was a national security interest. It was one of the first directives President Barack Obama ordered two months after he was elected in 2008. Inmates have slowly been transferred out and at the start of the year, 122 men were left. The peak population in 2003 was 684. Mr Earnest said the administration was "in the final stages of drafting a plan to safely and responsibly (close) the prison at Guantanamo Bay and to present that to Congress". He added: "That has been something that our national security officials have been working on for quite some time, primarily because it is a priority of the president." In 2009, President Obama admitted the January 2010 deadline he had set for closing the counter-terrorism facility would be missed. Since then, Congress bipartisan opposition has meant the transfer of prisoners to the US has been blocked. Some have been considered too dangerous to be released, but the US holds no evidence that can be used in civilian or military trials against them. The US has slowly been sending prisoners back to their home countries or to third countries, a process Mr Earnest said needs to continue if the facility is to shut. The camp was established in 2002 by the Bush administration to detain the most dangerous suspects for interrogation and the prosecution of war crimes. Controversy has centred around the period of time detainees have been held without charge and the use of interrogation techniques.	The White House is in the "final stages" of drafting a plan to close the controversial US military prison Guantanamo Bay, a spokesman has said.
US academics have produced international comparisons in key subjects - using tests taken in 2011 by 900,000 pupils in over 60 countries. It shows that Northern Ireland is Europe's top performing education system for primary maths. England has slipped in science, but is top 10 for primary and secondary maths. The top places in this global education league table have been taken by Singapore, Hong Kong and South Korea. Finland is among the highest placed European countries. Such comparisons have become increasingly influential - measuring pupils against the standards of international competitor countries. Globalisation in the jobs market and the economy has seen education ministers wanting to benchmark pupils' achievement against current international rivals. Such international rankings have also highlighted the educational strength underpinning the emerging economic powers in Asia. These latest rankings bring together two major studies - the four-yearly Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) and the five-yearly Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS). They reveal the continuing pattern of domination by a group of Asian education systems - South Korea, Singapore and Hong Kong (such international comparisons include regional school systems as well as countries). But the study, compiled by researchers at Boston College in the US, shows that England and Northern Ireland are performing strongly in the following group of European education systems. Source: TIMSS 2011 In maths, the study says England has been one of the most improved between 1995 and 2011. England remains in the global top 10 for maths - in 9th for primary and 10th for secondary. England has slipped in primary science tests, taken by 600,000 10 year olds - down to 15th place from 7th place in the last tests in 2007. There was also a dip for secondary science, taken by 14 year olds, down from 5th to 9th place. In the literacy tests, taken by a sample of 325,000 primary school pupils, there was progress for England - up from 15th to 11th. A spokesman for Education Secretary Michael Gove said: "These tests reflect progress between 2006 and 2011 and were taken only a year after the election. "So to the limited extent the results reflect the effect of political leadership, Labour deserves the praise for the small improvement in reading and the blame for the stagnation in maths and the decline in science. The tests say nothing, good or bad, about what we have done." Labour's education spokesman, Stephen Twigg, said: "These results show schools in England are some of the best in Europe - thanks to the hard work of teachers and pupils. The Labour government's reforms saw reading results improve thanks to better teaching, smaller class sizes and Labour's National Literacy Strategy. Source: TIMSS 2011 "However, we need to understand why East Asian countries out perform us in key skills - particularly science and maths." Mr Twigg also highlighted the lower achievement for Sweden in reading - linking it to the free schools inspired by the Swedish education system. There was a particularly strong performance for Northern Ireland - in 6th place for primary maths, which meant it was the highest ranking European school system. Northern Ireland, taking part in these tests for the first time, is in 5th place for primary reading - in a top group alongside such education superpowers such as Finland and Hong Kong. In terms of the proportion of pupils reaching the highest ability levels, Northern Ireland was even more successful, in 3rd place. The maths study also ranked the "safe and orderly" levels of schools - and found Northern Ireland was at the top, with England in 14th place. There was also a ranking of bullying for the primary maths study - with England having one of the worst records in Europe, in 30th place in terms of students' views of the levels of bullying. Scotland and Wales did not take part in these rankings. Such results show long-term trends, overlapping between different governments and education ministers. In England, the tests were taken under the current coalition government, but the pupils would have studied under the reforms of the previous Labour government. Source: PIRLS 2011 Researchers say the factors linked to success are a supportive home background and schools which have good discipline and experienced and well-motivated teachers. They also mention negative social factors, such as too many older pupils having learning impaired by a lack of adequate sleep. The maths study examined the availability of resources at home - such as books - with pupils in South Korea, Norway, Sweden and the US being the best equipped. Indonesia and Ghana had the least learning materials at home. There is a broad pattern repeated across these tables, with a cluster of Asian, Pacific Rim, countries at the top, European and western countries in the upper and middle ranks, with countries in North Africa and the Middle East in the lower ranks. Report author and Boston College professor, Michael Martin, said that the success of the top-performing countries reflects the long-term investment - and shows the way for other developing countries to follow. "Education is a multi-generational enterprise," he said. "One thing you can learn from these is what's possible. That comes as a shock sometimes, what students in other countries can actually do and the gap sometimes between what your students are achieving and what students in other countries are achieving," said Prof Martin. There are other international rankings - but these also show a similar picture at the top of the table, with education systems such as South Korea, Hong Kong, Finland and England among the highest performers. In global league tables assembled by Pearson last month, Finland and South Korea were top, with England in 6th place. The less expected success of the TIMSS and PIRLS rankings will be the high performance of Russia, which has a place in all their top 10s. Another prominent international ranking, the PISA tests run by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, has shown a strong performance for Chinese education systems, including Shanghai and Hong Kong.	Asian countries have taken top places in global school rankings for maths, science and reading, with England and Northern Ireland among high performers.
Thieves took the animal from Silver Star Pets in Pengam, along with dog leads, dog coats, fish tanks, pet food and dog grooming equipment worth £35,000. The incident is one of four break-ins that occurred at the Britannia Enterprise Centre some time between Tuesday evening and Wednesday morning. Police are appealing for information. The other units broken into were Auto Stitch, George Monumental Masons and Pride and Groom where damage was caused to the doors but nothing was stolen. A taxi sign, however, was also stolen from one of the vehicles parked at the centre.	An African Grey parrot valued at £900 has been stolen from a pet shop in Caerphilly.
Gary Price was suspended from all council duties for five months in November after Powys council's Standards Committee ruled he had breached the code of conduct. His appeal has been dismissed by the Adjudication Panel for Wales following a two-day hearing in Llandrindod Wells. Mr Price has been contacted for comment. He was found to have sent information which the council said "incorrectly and unfairly" portrayed what happened at a grievance appeal hearing, in which he was a panel member. The Adjudication Panel for Wales unanimously agreed to refer the matter back to the Standards Committee with a recommendation that Mr Price be suspended for three months. Council leader Barry Thomas said the decision "sends out a clear message that those who enter public office have to operate within the members' code of conduct and maintain the highest possible standards".	A decision to suspend a Powys county councillor has been upheld.
One of the most celebrated African-American broadcasters in the US was best known for moderating Washington Week in Review and for PBS NewsHour. Ifill had been absent for last week's election coverage due to ongoing health issues and had been on leave since May. "She was a journalist's journalist and set an example for all around her," said a PBS NewsHour executive producer. "Gwen was a standard bearer for courage, fairness and integrity in an industry going through seismic change," said producer Sarah Just. "She was a mentor to so many across the industry and her professionalism was respected across the political spectrum." At a daily news conference, President Barack Obama offered his "deepest condolences" from himself and the first lady. "She was a friend of ours, she was an extraordinary journalist, she always kept faith with the fundamental responsibilities of her profession," he said. Ifill had moderated two vice-presidential debates as well as a Democratic primary debate last year. In 2004 she moderated the debate between Dick Cheney and John Edwards, and in 2008 between Joe Biden and Sarah Palin. Last year she hosted the primary debate between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. Sarah Glover, the president of the National Associated of Black Journalists, expressed her condolences on Facebook, saying that Ifill "was a transformative voice among journalists". In 2013, after being named co-host of PBS Newshour, Ifill told the New York Times that she hoped she would inspire future minority journalists. "When I was a little girl watching programs like this - because that's the kind of nerdy family we were - I would look up and not see anyone who looked like me in any way. No women. No people of colour", she said. Paula Kerger, president and CEO of PBS, said that Ifill's "contributions to thoughtful reporting and civic discourse simply cannot be overstated." "She often said that her job was to bring light rather than heat to issues of importance to our society. Gwen did this with grace and steadfast commitment to excellence", Mrs Kerger added. Before working in broadcasting, Ifill had worked as a print reporter for the Baltimore Evening Sun, the Boston Herald American, the Washington Post, and the New York Times. She died after a battle with cancer.	Veteran journalist and news anchor Gwen Ifill has died aged 61, the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) has said.

The 2011 world silver medallist and partner Robert Blair beat Martin Campbell and Julie MacPherson 21-11 21-16 to extend her record in the event. Hamilton's Kirsty Gilmour made it five singles titles in a row with a 21-13 21-9 win over Edinburgh's MacPherson. And the Olympic hopeful won her fourth consecutive women's doubles title. Gilmour partnered Erskine's Rebekka Findlay to defeat MacPherson and Beith's Eleanor O'Donnell 21-17 21-7, leaving MacPherson with a trio of runners-up medals. Prior to the finals afternoon, Bankier, who has recently moved to Paris on a business venture, received a glass rock tablet from Badminton Scotland president Dan Travers. She said: "I had nine National titles and I suppose the thought of trying to get 10 was tempting and another Nationals meant that I would be able to play one last time in front of my family and the people who have helped me so much in my career. "I was really nervous before the final and I don't usually get affected like that. I had a sleepless night." It was a good day for Blair as he finished with two Scottish titles, having partnered Mauchline's Adam Hall to his first men's doubles title and Blair's third with different partners. The second seeds beat top seeds and defending champions Campbell and Patrick MacHugh in a high-quality final. The 21-19 21-18 win made up for Blair's defeat in last year's final when partnering Gordon Thomson. There was also a first National title for Matthew Carder after two years as runner-up to Kieran Merrilees in the men's singles. The South Queensferry player had to come from a game and 19-17 down against Glasgow's Thomson in the final against to win 18-21 21-19 21-17.	Imogen Bankier ended her badminton career with a 10th consecutive mixed doubles title at the Yonex Scottish National Championships in Perth.
The sofa was seen perched in the boot of the Toyota Celica on the A140 in Long Stratton, Norfolk, on Saturday by traffic officers, police said. They found it was tied in by a loose, thin, suitcase-like strap, that was "only partially holding the sofa". The driver was given a traffic offence report notice and may face more action. An officer on a motorcycle saw the vehicle at about 15:10 GMT. The Norfolk and Suffolk Roads Policing Unit tweeted about it and said it made them do a "double take". "More suitable vehicle or straps would be a better bet," the unit added.	Police have stopped a driver after they spotted a sofa precariously hanging out of the back of a sports car travelling on a busy road.
Italian artist and sculptor Maurizio Cattelan created the fully functional 18-carat gold lavatory, which he has titled America. The, ahem, interactive exhibit has been installed in one of the Guggenheim's public bathrooms, reports the New Yorker. The Fifth Avenue museum describes the piece as "a bold, irreverent work". The lavatory replaced one of the Guggenheim's porcelain toilets in a one-person, unisex restroom. Visitors who pay museum admission will be able to use it as they wish. The Guggenheim said the piece is "ultimately reminding us of the inescapable physical realities of our shared humanity". The exhibit is aimed at "making available to the public an extravagant luxury product seemingly intended for the 1 percent", according to the museum. "Its participatory nature, in which viewers are invited to make use of the fixture individually and privately, allows for an experience of unprecedented intimacy with a work of art," said the Guggenheim. Cattelan, a Milan-based artist and a truck driver's son, hinted earlier this year that his creation had been inspired by economic inequality. The exhibit has also drawn comparisons with Marcel Duchamp's avant-garde "Fountain", the porcelain urinal he exhibited in New York in 1917, causing a sensation in the art world. Cattelan, 55, is known for his provocative sculptures, including La Nona Ora (The Ninth Hour), which depicted Pope John Paul II floored by a meteorite.	Members of the public are being invited to spend a penny in a solid gold toilet at New York City's Guggenheim Museum.
The falls came after the head of the Eurogroup of eurozone finance ministers suggested that the Cyprus model, which involves a tax on bank deposits, could form a template in any future bailout. On Monday morning, hopes the deal would solve the crisis lifted shares. By 15:30 GMT, all major European markets had fallen into negative territory, joined by US stocks. The president of Cyprus, Nicos Anastasiades, later addressed his country in a television broadcast. The deal was "painful" but the best that could have been struck under the circumstances, he said. He said that controls limiting restricting the movement of capital would be temporary and he promised to protect the weak, saying that welfare payments would be met. Earlier, markets in Europe and the US moved downwards when Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch Finance Minister who as head of the Eurogroup played a key role in the Cyprus negotiations, said the deal represented a new template for resolving future eurozone banking problems. "If there is a risk in a bank our first question should be 'OK, what are you in the the bank going to do about that?'," he told Reuters and the Financial Times. He later added a clarification saying that Cyprus was "a specific case with exceptional challenges". The Cyprus deal puts the burden for dealing with problem banks on their shareholders and creditors - in this particular case, customers with large bank balances - rather than the government and taxpayers - and bondholders, who lend through financial markets. Our World Economics Editor, Andrew Walker, pointed out the more usual approach to failing banks in the current crisis has been for the state to inject new capital. He says that Cyprus's banks are unusual in that they have relatively low amounts of financial market investors which could be tapped. In the past, nations such as Ireland have pumped billions of taxpayers' money into propping up their banks, rather than risk upsetting large investors and spooking the financial system. Mr Dijsselbloem said the pattern for bank rescues should see shareholders take the first hit, then bond holders, who lend money through financial markets, and only then should depositors with large bank balances be tapped. By Stephanie FlandersEconomics editor But Mr Dijsselbloem's remarks raised fears that other European countries with struggling banks may face the same solution as Cyprus, which agreed to force those with cash on deposit above 100,000 euros (Â£85,000), many of whom are Russian, to pay a substantial tax. Cyprus will receive 10bn euros ($13bn; Â£8.5bn) in bailout funds, but has agreed to a major restructuring of its banks. Small savers will be protected but Cyprus's second largest bank - Laiki Bank - will be wound up and split into "good" and "bad" banks, with its good assets eventually merged into the Bank of Cyprus, the country's biggest bank. The two banks will remain closed until Thursday, while all others will reopen on Tuesday after being closed for more than a week, Cyprus's central bank says. By Robert PestonBusiness editor The Cypriot government suggested that account holders with deposits of more than 100,000 euros should expect to lose about 30% of their balances. The UK's FTSE 100 index ended the day down 0.2%, while Germany's Dax gave up 0.5%, and France's Cac lost 1.1%. In New York, the Dow Jones was 0.5% lower. In Madrid, the market slipped 2.5% while the Milan index was down 2.27%. The euro was also driven lower, falling to a six-week low against the pound. The euro was down 0.6% to 84.74 pence. Jeroen Dijsselbloem The new deal for Cyprus, unlike previous agreements, does not require the approval of the Cypriot parliament. The uncertainty over the future of Cyprus in the eurozone was sparked a week ago when its parliament rejected an earlier bailout deal, which also included a controversial bank levy. Despite the Cypriot economy's relatively small size, many analysts had been concerned that the crisis would spread to the wider eurozone, had Cyprus been forced to give up the single currency. There were fears that the country's possible exit from the euro would trigger a loss of confidence across the single currency bloc, and prompt investors to withdraw from other troubled economies, such as Greece. However, while Cyprus is now likely to remain in the eurozone, the country still faces significant obstacles as it attempts to recover from the crisis. The EU-IMF deal involves a massive restructuring of the Cypriot banking system, as well as austerity measures and tax increases. There has also been significant public anger in Cyprus at the intervention of European authorities, and the credibility of the Cypriot government has been questioned. "We see a risk that Cyprus' sovereign debt burden post-bailout might not be sustainable, as the country is likely to enter a deep recession caused by the shrinkage of the banking sector and severe deleveraging," warned Reinhard Cluse, an economist at UBS.	European and US stock markets have fallen despite the agreement of a bailout deal for Cyprus.
Landlords who let properties to more than three unrelated people need to apply for a licence for a House of Multiple Occupation (HMO). But many are put off - because a licence can cost ??1,000 - despite facing a fine of up to ??20,000, Southampton City Council said. The authority estimated a total of 1,500 unlicensed HMOs in the area. Shelter helpline adviser Nadeem Khan said fear of eviction and living in poorly maintained properties are frequent concerns raised by HMO tenants. "Because of the huge shortage of affordable homes people are being forced into rented homes which are unregulated. We receive about five or six calls a day about this," he said. Nationally, mandatory licensing for HMOs is aimed at houses of three storeys or more and occupied by five or more unrelated people. In Southampton, the licences affect properties in Bargate, Bevois, Portswood, Swaythling (Designation 1 - introduced in 2013) and in Shirley Freemantle, Millbrook, and Bassett (Designation 2 - introduced in 2015). A council spokesman said: "Landlords have generally co-operated with the regime, but a small minority have resisted applying for their licence." The council said it had so far gained prosecutions against one firm and 13 individuals.	Tenants in Southampton may face eviction because landlords are holding incorrect paperwork, Shelter claims.
They began the third day 75 runs behind with five first-innings wickets in hand. For them to win on the same evening is not quite unprecedented, but certainly highly unusual, especially in the age of covered pitches. At lunchtime, South Africa were basically level with all 10 wickets intact. It was their opportunity to bat England out of the game. Instead, less than two sessions later, they were beaten. It was incredible. The catalyst for it all was Stuart Broad. As soon as he starts lifting those knees up and running in hard, batsmen are in trouble. Media playback is not supported on this device His 5-1 in 31 balls is the seventh time he has taken five wickets in a single spell of bowling. Those are match-winning performances. He was helped by conditions - the clouds hung around, the floodlights were on all day, the new ball was venomous and brutal. But the bowler still has to put the ball in the right place and, in those circumstances, Broad is a formidable man to face. It wasn't just the deliveries that took wickets that were dangerous - some were flying past the nose, others were crashing into flesh. South Africa will not only be suffering the pain of defeat, but also the bruises of leather on skin. These spells that Broad bowls - The Oval in 2009, Chester-le-Street in 2013, Trent Bridge in 2015 and now here - are symptomatic of his character. If your team is in a situation where someone needs to stand up and be counted, then Broad wants to be that man. He uses all of his 6ft 6in to get bounce, but also swings and seams the ball as well. He's accurate, so builds pressure. On top of that, he loves to get in your face and under your skin. Broad, though, is just one of the players capable of turning a Test for England. In fact, I'm willing to stick my neck out and say that it is unusual for England to be blessed with so many match-winners. Broad, Ben Stokes and Joe Root can all turn the momentum in a session. We know what a fully fit James Anderson is capable of and Steven Finn showed during the Ashes that he can bowl a magic spell. This ability to turn a Test from a position of peril began for England back in the summer. On the first morning against New Zealand at Lord's, England found themselves 30-4, only for Root and Stokes to counter-attack. For years, England had it done to them - think of the havoc that Australia's Adam Gilchrist used to cause. Now, England are doing it to other teams with a great deal of flair and courage. They are a team on the up and one I fancied to beat South Africa, who, in contrast, are a team in decline. The Proteas may have started the series ranked number one, but we knew they were no longer the world's outstanding team. Yes, they have been deprived of Dale Steyn and Vernon Philander - and it is a shame that England did not have the chance to beat a full-strength South Africa - but that might not have made a difference. South Africa simply did not have the chance to get over their humbling in India and therefore carried the scars into this series. England had the opportunity to draw a line under their defeat against Pakistan in the UAE, a series where they far from disgraced themselves. Looking ahead, England have two home series in the summer that they should win. The last time Sri Lanka were in England, they won, so Alastair Cook has a score to settle there and some ranking points to win back. You never know which Pakistan will turn up, but England will again be favourites. They then go to Bangladesh, which will be good preparation for a formidable trip to India, the new world number ones. Then again, England won the last time they were there too. These things go in cycles and, in English cricket, we tend to look forward to the Ashes as a marker and a time to be judged. The next date with Australia is at the end of 2017, down under. Almost two years out, England look well-placed. Jonathan Agnew was talking to BBC Sport's Stephan Shemilt	England's victory in the third Test against South Africa in Johannesburg was quite remarkable.
Children in P6 and P7 will learn how to cope with change under the Healthy Me programme developed by Northern Ireland charity, Action Mental Health. Its chief executive David Babington said it will help prepare pupils for the stresses of the transfer test and big changes in their educational life. Five schools took part in a pilot. The charity is now hoping the programme will be rolled out in schools across Northern Ireland. It consists of "interactive workshops" in which pupils are made aware of the importance of emotional wellbeing; encouraged to seek help if they are in distress and helped to identify sources of support. The workshops also provide teachers with basic training in promoting emotional wellbeing. The Healthy Me initiative was launched at Carrick Primary School in Lurgan, County Armagh, on Friday morning. The school's pastoral care co-ordinator, Helen Hamilton, is also its P7 teacher and said the programme has helped pupils and parents ahead of the big move. "I see the anxiety in kids starting to build about secondary school," Ms Hamilton told BBC News NI. "No fault of the secondary school - they're excellent and many are very excited to be going there - but they're apprehensive too and a lot of the time, that can be fed down from parents as well, they're worried about them. "You're going from a very close-knit family atmosphere in a primary school - where you have one teacher who sees a child every day all day, and gets to know them and their wee quirks and can spot very quickly if they're out of sorts - to the very difficult job of senior school teachers who see them maybe for half an hour. "It's more difficult for them to pick up on those things, much as they try, so parents sometimes need the reassurance and understanding that the transition can be easier than they expect." Getting a place in a secondary school can be source of stress however, and last month, thousands of P7 pupils began to sit this year's unofficial transfer tests, set by two different examination bodies, the Association of Quality Education (AQE) and GL Assessment. Pupils have the choice to sit either test, both tests, or none, but figures provided to the BBC by the two organisations indicated a slight rise in the number of entrants sitting the tests this year, with a total of 14,681, a rise from 14,575 in 2015. "Transition from primary to secondary school is a particularly stressful time for children and we believe that targeting the programme at P6/P7 children will help them cope with this transition," Mr Babington said. "Modern life is stressful and can impact on mental health, so implementing strategies for protecting children from stress and helping them learn to cope with change is an extremely positive influence on their young lives," the Action Mental Health boss added. Ms Hamilton said that in the workshops, children were taught breathing exercises, and "how to relax", including how to take time out from busy after-school activity regimes. "We, as a school, value so much the amount of evidence that shows that children who, mentally and emotionally, aren't ready to learn cannot progress, so   it's so important for us that children's social and emotional needs are met," the P7 teacher added. The need to "strengthen the resilience of young people" is one of the key challenges facing Northern Ireland's education system, according to the chief inspector of schools, Noelle Buick. "All young people need to build resilience," she wrote in her  latest report, published last month.. The chief inspector said pupils were facing "complex challenges" because the "social context of relationships, values, attitudes and behaviours in which children and young people live and learn has changed significantly" in recent years. "It is timely to review the need for strengthening the resilience of children and young people at all levels through stronger and more explicit preventative education within the wider taught pastoral care curriculum."	Pupils preparing to leave primary school are being taught how to deal with stress and to be more resilient as part of a new mental health initiative.
Council officials will meet on Tuesday to start the process of identifying where the Maes will be. A cabinet report said 140 acres were needed, along with good mobile phone signal and, if possible, fibre broadband. Town and community councils will be contacted, asking for suggestions to be sent to Ceredigion council by March. Once these have been received, they will be forwarded to the National Eisteddfod board, which is responsible for choosing the host site. The county hosted the first known eisteddfod, when Lord Rhys, prince of Deheubarth, gathered poets and musicians at his castle in Cardigan in AD 1176.	Suggestions for the potential host site of the 2020 National Eisteddfod in Ceredigion are being sought.
Ministers and other government officials are being given a three-month deadline to hand over state-owned homes and vehicles, from the date of the new president's inauguration. The law targets presidential appointees who try to cling on to the perks of office after a new leader is elected. Ghana goes to the polls on 7 December. After previous transfers of power, some officials have had to be forcibly evicted and had their state-owned vehicles seized after failing to hand them back. The law does not apply to presidents and vice-presidents as we earlier reported. The bill, which was passed by MPs on Wednesday evening, will now go to the president to sign into law. Existing legislation requires officials to hand back government property after they leave office, but this is the first time a strict time limit has been applied. Ghana's current leader John Mahama is standing for re-election and his main opponent is Nana Akufo-Addo. The winner will be inaugurated on 7 January 2017. Ghana's presidential candidates:	Outgoing ministers in Ghana could be forcibly evicted from their official residences if they fail to move out in time, under new laws.
The business was owned by John and Karen Blisard and began operating in 2007. It now has five branches: two in Belfast, two in Dublin and one in Galway. The firm's last set of abbreviated accounts suggest it made a profit of around Â£300,000 in 2014. It has been taken over by Belfast brothers David and Andrew Maxwell. They are backed by the Dublin-based investment firm Renatus Capital Partners Andrew Maxwell is a former professional rugby player with Ulster. David has previously run restaurants in Arizona where he said he "fell in love with Mexican food and culture". He said they planned to expand the chain. "The management and crew at Boojum provide exceptional service which has been pivotal to the success of the business," they said. "Our aim, in partnership with Renatus, is to preserve that success and build on it. "We expect to create many new jobs as we bring the Boojum experience to new communities." The deal was initiated by the Belfast-based corporate advisors HNH Group. Matt McCullough from HNH played rugby at Ulster with Andrew Maxwell. He said: "Knowing the Maxwells, who are high quality operators with a passion for Mexican food, we felt they would be capable of maintaining everything that is good about the Boojum brand, whilst moving the business forward. "These aspects were key to making this deal happen." The sale does not include the Blisard's barbecue restaurant, Bubbacue.	Boojum, the Belfast-based chain of burrito restaurants, has been sold.
The 30-year-old joined Cobblers on a one-year deal last summer, making 25 appearances in all competitions. But boss Justin Edinburgh said the club were unable to "get comfortable" with his commitments to DR Congo. "Gaby is a top professional, we wish him all the very best for his future career," said Edinburgh.	League One side Northampton Town have released defender Gabriel Zakuani after contract talks broke down over his international commitments.
The Iron have lost three of their last six league games, but are still second in League One. The home defeat by Shrewsbury on 11 February ended a run of 26 league games without losing at Glanford Park. "Let's get real, we are second in the league and that is after playing probably our worst football of the season," Swann told the club website. "Do you honestly believe that when a player doesn't control the ball with his first touch of the game we should be on his back?" He added: "The rumours of contract disputes, unrest in the team, a not-bothered attitude, is so far from the truth it hurts when I read it and certain people just want to derail our success whether knowingly, or not, which is even more annoying. "We ask passionately that you all get behind them and give them that chance to recapture their form and yes, do not panic, because we can do it, we can get promoted and we can be proud of them." The Iron were top of the table when they last won, against Port Vale on 28 January, but are now seven points behind leaders Sheffield United and level on points with third-placed Fleetwood. Scunthorpe host the Cod Army on Saturday.	Scunthorpe chairman Peter Swann has urged fans to keep faith in the team and "not get on players' backs".
A Leave vote was always seen as more likely to generate significant disturbances in the financial world. For that reason it is also the result which was thought more likely to pose a headache for the world's central banks. There have already been statements from some that they are prepared to act to maintain financial stability. There are two potential issues they might want to respond to in the short term: the stability of the (commercial) banks and swings in exchange rates. With the banks there is a possibility of a general rise in risk aversion, and some might have difficulty borrowing in the inter-bank market. The ultimate danger from that is that they might be unable to make debt payments as they come due. Central banks can address that by lending them extra money (liquidity). In the UK the Bank of England has already been doing this ahead of the referendum, hoping to ensure that there is sufficient liquidity already in place. The Bank has said it "will continue to monitor market conditions carefully and keep its operations under review". Other central banks will be ready to take similar action if they think it's needed. What if the strains show up in terms of foreign currency liquidity - say an Italian bank needing quick access to Swiss francs? There are arrangements known as swap lines put in place during the international financial crisis that can be used if necessary. The Italian bank could then get Swiss francs from the European Central Bank (ECB), (and the Swiss National Bank would be able to offer euros to Swiss banks if needed). The Bank of England is involved in these arrangements so it can get foreign currency if British banks were to need it urgently. With sharp moves in exchange rates, there are several options. They could just live with it. But if they felt the swings were too sharp and destabilising they could intervene using their foreign currency reserves. In the case of the UK, the decision to conduct such intervention is for the Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, with the Bank of England carrying it out in the markets. So if there were too precipitous a fall in the value of one currency (sterling would be the obvious candidate in the event of a leave vote) the Bank of England could buy sterling with dollars or yen from its reserves, hoping the additional demand for the pound would support its value. Conversely the Swiss National Bank has been worried about too rapid a rise in the Swiss franc and has already been into the markets to buy other currencies such as the euro with its own national currency. Further action on these lines is a possibility. Currencies seen as havens are susceptible to unwanted sharp rises in times of financial stress and the Swiss franc is a prime example of that. Currency market intervention is often not announced. Some observers say there is evidence suggesting that the Swiss central bank might have intervened over the past week.  The intervention after the vote by the SNB was announced however. Interest rates can also be used to curb currency moves - a cut to stop a currency rising; a rate rise to prevent a fall. Both options, interest rate moves and intervention, can be co-ordinated by central banks. Further quantitative easing (QE) is also a possible response to a rising currency. It tends to drive down market interest rates and there has been some speculation that it might be on the agenda very soon,  perhaps from the Bank of Japan (which does not want to see the yen gaining value). Interest rate moves and QE can also be used to address longer term fallout - to tackle any impact on inflation or growth. The Bank of England has scope to cut rates further and it could undertake further QE. A fall in sterling would be inflationary, though up to a point that could be welcome as inflation is currently (at 0.3%) far below the Bank's target (2%). Another risk is that in a general flight from riskier assets the government debt problem in the eurozone could return, pushing up borrowing costs for countries such as Spain and Italy that were in the firing line a few years ago. Those earlier eurozone storms abated after the ECB announced that it was prepared in some circumstances to buy the bonds, the debts, of governments severely affected. In the event it never used this new weapon. The mere threat of doing so was enough to settle the eurozone bond market. Some observers, such as the London consultancy Capital Economics, think it could finally use this programme, if the aftermath of a leave vote were sufficiently disruptive. The likely timescale for these options varies.  In principle many could be done very quickly. The most urgent, if needed, would probably be bank liquidity. Interest rates and QE could be announced early, but could also be used as a response to economic fallout that might emerge over a longer period. The ECB's option of riding to the rescue of the likes of Spain or Italy would take some time. They would need to have an economic policy programme agreed with the rest of the eurozone. And Spain in particular, with an election this weekend, is itself in a period of political uncertainty that could make it difficult to conduct international negotiations.	Economic policymakers must now decide whether and how they should respond to the UK's vote to leave the EU.
After years of decline, the number of public authority homes sold in the year to March rose from 1,209 to 1,526. Ministers announced last year that right-to-buy, previously abolished for new tenants, was to end altogether. Statisticians concluded that the announcement was "likely to be responsible" for the upturn in sales. Over the same period, 1,140 new council homes were built in Scotland, the highest total in 25 years. The number of affordable homes also rose by 17%, with 7,012 completed. Housing minister Margaret Burgess said: "Over 4,000 new council houses have been delivered through the Scottish government's council house building programme since 2009. "The supply of affordable housing continues to be a high priority for us and we are working with the entire sector to increase the supply of affordable homes and deliver vital support for construction and housebuilding companies throughout Scotland. "Since 2011 we have delivered more than 21,000 new affordable homes, bringing us over two-thirds of the way towards our five-year target of 30,000 new homes." Across Scotland the total number of new homes increased by 7% over the past year to 15,957 - with Aberdeenshire, Edinburgh and Glasgow accounting for more than a quarter. The increase is the first since 2007/08 but the supply of new homes still remains well below pre-recession levels. Ms Burgess said: "This is the first annual increase since before the recession, reflecting the growing confidence within the housing market, which the Scottish government has helped to stimulate through investment in initiatives designed to support the sector and help people into home ownership. "Nonetheless, new housing supply remains well below pre-recession levels and I recognise that the housebuilding industry continues to face a number of challenges." The Scottish Federation of Housing Associations (SFHA) broadly welcomed the new statistics. It said: "The recognition, however, that we still have a very long way to go to recover from the 42% decrease in completions since then, is sobering and reflects the challenge to all providers of new housing. "The drop in housing association completions represents the time lag between the introduction of the new subsidy levels in 2013 and the time taken to kick-start many projects previously unviable because of lower grant levels. "However, the increase in approvals for housing association projects - up from 1,620 in 2012/13 to 2,875 in 2013/14 - gives some hope that we are beginning to recover from a devastating slowdown in the construction of social housing, at a time when almost one million Scots can't afford adequate housing conditions." Responding to the figures, trade body Homes for Scotland warned that sustained increases in production were now under threat after last month's announcement that the Scottish government's Help to Buy scheme had run out of money for this financial year. Chief executive Philip Hogg said: "The figures show that the increase in supply was driven by the private sector and this clearly demonstrates the huge impact made by the very successful Help to Buy (Scotland) scheme, which has generated over 4,300 sales and reservations since launch less than a year ago. "Whilst we applaud the Scottish government for introducing the scheme, funding for this year has already run out, leaving both buyers and builders very frustrated. "The industry has effectively had the rug pulled from beneath it before any firm recovery has had the opportunity to take hold. "And the impact is already apparent with significant drops in sales in the weeks since the budget expired in July.  We therefore fear a return to decline in the months ahead.	Council house sales in Scotland rose by 26% following the decision to scrap tenants' right-to-buy, according to official figures.
Diabetes UK Cymru says there are now 177,212 people in Wales living with the condition. It said if the trend continues these figures could rise to 288,000 by 2025. Launching Diabetes Week, the charity said a lack of education on managing the condition had led to "devastating" health complications, including amputations, blindness and strokes. According to the charity, many cases of type 2 diabetes can be prevented but there is no way of preventing type 1. Diabetes costs NHS Wales nearly Â£500m a year, it added. Diabetes UK Cymru's director Dai Williams said: "Over the last decade we have seen the number of people with diabetes rising at an alarming rate and these latest figures are a stark call to action. "We must act now or face the very real danger of diabetes devastating the lives of even more people, and threatening to wreck the already over-burdened NHS."	The number of people with diabetes in Wales has reached an "all-time high", a charity has warned.
Here are the best bits we heard backstage at the Royal Albert Hall in London. In La La Land, Emma Stone plays aspiring actress Mia Dolan. So does the best actress winner think Mia could ever win a Bafta or Oscar? After a dramatic pause, she delivered her verdict. "Hopefully!" "It's been like a whirlwind," said Spider-Man actor Tom Holland, winner of the Rising Star Award. "I'm so happy everything seems to be working out." The 20-year-old Brit isn't wrong there. Having made his screen debut in tsunami disaster movie The Impossible, he first appeared as Spidey in Captain America: Civil War and recently finished filming for Spider-Man: Homecoming. But Tom admitted the super hero role has its drawbacks. "Ever since I was a kid I've wanted to be Spider-Man. It's been so fun, but my legs are in bits right now from spider poses after spider poses. "So I'll be sitting down for the rest of the evening!" It was perhaps inevitable that Meryl Streep's speech at the Golden Globes would come up at the Baftas. Asked about Donald Trump's response, supporting actress winner Viola Davis didn't hold back. "Anyone who labels Meryl Streep an 'overrated' actress obviously doesn't know anything about acting," she said. "That's not just directed towards Donald Trump - that's directed towards anyone." She didn't stop there. "This is someone who is the master at her skill and she has lasted for 40 years in a very difficult profession," Viola continued. "One of the things people have to know about this woman is that she is the most honourable, accessible human being you could possibly want to meet." Best actor winner Casey Affleck said he'd grabbed a word with Meryl Streep after the Baftas ceremony. "She was taking pictures of people... and I told her how much her speech at the Golden Globes meant to all of us and how grateful I was that she did it and kicked in the door a little bit," he said. The Manchester by the Sea star said he hoped more actors would speak out. "There is a big audience for these awards shows... and I have to say I'm very proud to be a part of the arts community. "I don't always say some of the things I would like to say in those opportunities because there are people like Meryl Streep who say them much better than I can - and if they are going to be said it should be said very, very well because they are important." "I'm a little bit wobbly," confessed Dev Patel a few minutes after winning the supporting actor prize for Lion. "I really did not expect it, we have gone to so many awards ceremony and this one is where everything changed, on home turf with my family." Dev recalled how he had made his acting debut a decade ago on E4's teen drama Skins. "I remember the first time I ever stepped on a film set, I never knew what a boom mic was," he laughed. "My mum took me to an open casting of Skins after she saw an advert in Metro newspaper and 10 years on we are here at the Baftas - that is pretty amazing." Justin Hurwitz, who won the Bafta for his original music in La La Land, said that he'd written a title song that didn't end up in the movie. "It was going to be in the middle of the movie but we nixed that, and then we toyed with using it in the end credits, and we nixed that at the last minute." And how about this? Another Day of Sun, from the famous traffic jam scene, was cut "for many months" before being put back in as the big opening number. Mel Brooks, who was awarded the prestigious Bafta Fellowship, was asked about whether he might write a comedy about Donald Trump. "I'm not afraid of him, I don't think he's dangerous," said the 90-year-old writer, actor and producer. "I think he's mostly an entertainer, a guy who wants audiences to love him. "What I'm afraid of are all the guys around him, the people who whisper in his ears, like the people who whispered in George W Bush's ears and we got the Iraq War... "I just hope that Trump stays the egomaniac he is, listens to no-one and then we'll all be safe. But if he believes these guys we're all in trouble." Mel was in a lighter mood as he plugged his new musical Young Frankenstein, which will open in London's West End this year after a run in Newcastle. "I think, modestly speaking, it will be sensational," he chuckled. Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

Sylvia Blackburn, 72, suffered serious head injuries outside Bedford Road Lower School, Kempston, on 19 December 2014. Luton Crown Court heard Brian Wright, 55, of Kempston, said he was unable to see at the point of impact. He denies causing serious injury by dangerous driving. Prosecutor Sally Mealing-McLeod said Mrs Blackburn, a lollipop lady for 20 years, had been on duty in Bedford Road as pupils were leaving school on the last day of term. She was wearing a long-sleeved high-visibility orange and yellow coat which had reflective strips and "school crossing patrol" written on the back. When the traffic lights turned red, she stepped out to escort a woman and her six-year-old daughter across the road. Traffic travelling in the opposite direction stopped, but Mr Wright's VW Golf failed to stop and hit her at 14mph, the jury heard. Witnesses described Mrs Blackburn's head hitting the screen pillar of the windscreen before she struck the wing mirror and then the road. The married mother of three was airlifted to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge. She was later transferred to Bedford Hospital and is now at a residential care home for people with an acquired brain injury. Mr Wright, of The Dell, declined to comment in police interview but in a statement said he was blinded by the setting sun and lowered his visor but was unable to see when the collision happened. The court heard the sun was 10 minutes from setting and could have been shining into Mr Wright's eyes. Ms Mealing-McLeod told the jury that if his vision had been affected he should have stopped. The trial continues.	A driver "blinded" by the sun drove through a red light at a pedestrian crossing and knocked down a lollipop lady, a jury has heard.
Burberry rose 2.81% on speculation that the company could be takeover target for a US private equity firm. Mining shares were hit by a number of broker downgrades following recent falls in commodity prices.

(Close): Fashion house Burberry led the market higher following speculation that it could be a bid target.
Gray opened the scoring from the spot after Shane Duffy felled George Boyd in the area. Rovers pressed for an equaliser but Elliott Bennett's powerful effort was brilliantly kept out by home keeper Tom Heaton. The Clarets are now four points clear of third-placed Hull. Relive Burnley v Blackburn here The victory was the first time Burnley had beaten Rovers at Turf Moor in 38 years and took them a point above Middlesbrough, who beat Wolves 2-1 on Friday night. Paul Lambert's visitors might feel aggrieved they did not get anything from the game, having had 15 attempts to Burnley's eight and being dominant in the second half. Blackburn also felt they should have been awarded a first-half penalty when Hope Akpan went down under the challenge of Stephen Ward, while Heaton was again on hand to deny Bennett's low drive in the second period. Michael Keane did have a late chance to seal it for the hosts, but the centre-back scuffed Scott Arfield's delivery when free in the area as Sean Dyche's side held on to a hard-fought win. Burnley manager Sean Dyche: "That's my sixth Lancashire derby and I've not seen a decent one yet. "They've always been tight affairs and we thought it might be that type of game again. "It was cagey and awkward but obviously I'm delighted we came out on top and it is fantastic for the town and the fans. For me it's three points and another win but for the town it is a different thing." Blackburn boss Paul Lambert: "I thought we should have won. We were brilliant on Tuesday and we were great today. "I'm sitting here totally relaxed because I thought we played a right good game against a side who have a lot of Premier League players and have more money than us. "You wouldn't have noticed the points difference today and that's the level I want my players to play at." Match ends, Burnley 1, Blackburn Rovers 0. Second Half ends, Burnley 1, Blackburn Rovers 0.

The Nevada State Athletic Commission (NAC) confirmed a one-off rule change to drop the glove size from 10oz. "I don't believe with the new gloves he makes it out of the second round," said UFC champion McGregor, 29. "Part of me kind of wants to show some skill and dismantle him but I do not see him absorbing the blows." "I am ready to go to war for 12 rounds and I am also ready to put him away in seconds," he added. "There is no way in hell I am not prepared to fight in the deepest of trenches." The move to allow lighter gloves came as a surprise as the 154lbs bout is considerably over the 147lbs limit at which 8oz gloves can be used. The lighter gloves have less padding over the knuckles and are believed to favour the heavier puncher. Earlier in August, the NAC, who sanctioned the contest, told BBC Sport they could not recall a fight at 154lbs ever being given dispensation to make such a move. McGregor typically uses 4oz fingerless gloves in MMA, while undefeated boxer Mayweather has used 8oz gloves in 46 of his 49 bouts. In a lengthy conference call, McGregor took questions from journalists around the world just 10 days before he makes his boxing debut in Las Vegas against former five-weight world champion Mayweather, 40. He revealed he has been conducting "scary" training sessions at 13,000ft in an altitude chamber and stated he feels in "absolutely amazing" condition for the T-Mobile Arena bout. But the UFC lightweight champion believes he has been "discarded" by boxing analysts and made to feel "not welcome" in the build-up to what could be the richest fight in history. "It's certainly motivating - the disrespect and disregard for my skillset," added McGregor. "I look at people sometimes and their mind is closed. "Fighting is a complex game. I use it as motivation and I look forward to going in and educating the world on what martial arts is." McGregor's future beyond his boxing debut has been queried by MMA fans who fear he may not be motivated to return to UFC after earning a reported $100m in facing Mayweather. He addressed several potential career avenues during the conference call and contests he is still a current multiple-weight UFC champion despite vacating his featherweight belt in November. "The current featherweight champion is Max Holloway, a man I dismantled," added McGregor. "Everyone knows, I am the multiple world champion. I look forward to going back and continuing where I left off." McGregor said Mayweather would get his "respect" if he followed through on comments made on a US talk show this week in which he said the pair could rematch under MMA rules. Paulie Malignaggi - who quit as McGregor's sparring partner after reacting angrily to images appearing to show him knocked down in a session - has also raised the prospect of coming out of retirement to box the Irishman. "Tell him to shut his mouth and join the queue," McGregor said when asked about facing the former two-weight world champion. "He got whooped and went sprinting. There's a big list of people who want to fight me."	Conor McGregor says he will beat Floyd Mayweather Jr in two rounds after the use of 8oz gloves was approved for the contest in Las Vegas on 26 August.
Judge Thomas Lipps rejected arguments by defence lawyers that witnesses could face intimidation or harassment outside the courthouse in Steubenville. The case has attracted attention due to social media and the high profile of the football team in the small town. Judge Lipps also ruled the non-jury trial would be open to the public. He did so over the objections of the family of the 16-year-old girl who was allegedly attacked. She wanted to protect her identity and keep evidence that might eventually be ruled inadmissible from becoming public. Trenton Mays and Ma'lik Richmond, both 16, deny the charges they face next month at a juvenile court. Three other students who witnessed the alleged attack but were not charged are expected to testify at next month's trial. Those witnesses include two who took a video and photograph, then deleted the images. The Ohio attorney general's office told lawyers for those students last autumn that if the images had been found, they would have been charged. Prosecutors say the girl, who went to a school across the river from the city in West Virginia, was attacked after an alcohol-fuelled party last August. The case was thrust into the national spotlight after attention by bloggers and the hacker activist group Anonymous. Some claimed that the community had sought to cover up the alleged crime in order protect the two accused. The trial is set for 13 March.	An Ohio judge has ruled that the rape trial of two high school football players will take place in the county where the alleged attack happened.
But the former Scotland midfielder insists that he can turn the Cumbernauld outfit around despite only one win in 12 games. "Of course I can," the 39-year-old manager told BBC Scotland. "But, if we have any aspirations about getting into the play-offs, we need to win on Saturday." With Forfar Athletic eight points clear of Arbroath at the top, Clyde slipped 15 points behind third-placed Elgin City when they were trounced 4-1 away to the Moray outfit on Saturday. The Bully Wee are also 11 points behind this weekend's hosts, who sit in the final play-off spot. Ferguson's side do have three games in hand over Annan, but Montrose and Berwick Rangers have also overtaken Clyde during their run of nine league games without a win. "It is tough," admitted Ferguson, who previously had a spell as caretaker manager with Blackpool. "Listen, it's easy to walk away, but I am there fighting and we'll get into the play-offs." Clyde have played fewer games as a result of a run to the fifth round of the Scottish Cup that ended last midweek after they lost 2-1 in extra-time at home to Championship outfit Ayr United. "We had a long game on Tuesday night - went into 120 minutes and into extra-time, but I'm not going to use it as an excuse," said the Bully Wee boss, whose side were praised for their display against the full-time visitors. "We try to do everything properly, the recovery - we went and got protein shakes, recovery shakes, we took them up the night before, which we normally don't do because it is a bit of a cost to the club. "But it just wasn't good enough. I'm not going to mix my words. I told them after the game." Ferguson, who had a long playing career in the top flight in Scotland and England, has often expressed his frustration at managing part-time players. "On Tuesday night, Ayr United scored the winner in extra-time," he said. "I had four guys who were going straight from that game to night shift for eight or nine-hour shifts. "I take my hat off to them as a realise now how difficult it is. "But that's why we do a pre-season and we should should be fit enough to play three games in a week."	Clyde's Barry Ferguson admits it is make or break for his side's promotion play-off chances when they travel to face Annan Athletic on Saturday.
Tiffany Li, 31, posted $4m in cash and pledged $61m in property, raised from a group of friends, family and business associates, the Associated Press said. The bail had been set at $35m, but California courts require double the amount if property is used. Her lawyer said she was "well-liked in the community", the LA Times reported. "I was surprised at the number of people that came forward," Geoff Carr said, "I think people believe she is not guilty," he told the newspaper. Ms Li has pleaded not guilty to charges that she conspired with her boyfriend, Kaveh Bayat, and another man, Olivier Adella, to kill Keith Green, 27, and dispose of his body last year. Prosecutors say she feared losing custody of her young children to Mr Green. San Mateo County District Attorney Steve Wagstaffe told the LA Times the bail sum - described as "mind boggling" in one news report - would be the highest ever posted in the wealthy county's history. He said he believed her to be a flight risk, but that lawyers on both sides had agreed that if the expected release went ahead she would have to wear an electronic monitoring bracelet, be under house arrest and surrender her passport as well as her children's. Mr Carr said he expected Ms Li, a Chinese-born property manager and former stockbroker, to be released on Thursday, the Associated Press reported. A family friend of Mr Green, Angela Dunn, said news of the bail was "very disappointing", ABC7 reported. Mr Green and Ms Li had met on 28 April at a pancake restaurant near her home in Hillsborough, an area south of San Francisco, considered one of the wealthiest communities in the US. But he never returned home. His body was found nearly two weeks later, some 80 miles (128km) north. He had been shot dead. A week after that, Ms Li, Mr Adella and Mr Bayat were arrested on suspicion of murder.	A California woman suspected of murdering the father of her two children is hoping to be released from prison after raising $65m (Â£52m) bail.
Media playback is not supported on this device The striker has scored 12 goals for City, but they are bottom of their Champions League group and six points behind Premier League leaders Chelsea. "Of course we understand the people who have been criticising us," 26-year-old Aguero told Football Focus. "The club invests in top players and the fans want to see more from us." Aguero added: "But we still have time to put things right. The supporters here are more respectful and patient but they still expect a bit more from all of us. We can still turn it around, though." The Argentina international scored the winner as City began the week by winning 1-0 in a tumultuous Manchester derby. But on Wednesday, they were booed off the field after losing 2-1 at home to Russian side CSKA Moscow. City's Champions League record since they first played in the competition in 2011 is played 24, won eight, drawn six, lost 10. They have not kept a clean sheet in nine home games. Manuel Pellegrini's team could go out even if they win their next two games against Roma and Bayern Munich. "In the Champions League, we are not currently in the position we want to be," said Aguero.  "It's not what we were expecting. The only thing we can do is to keep going, we still have two games to play and we have to win both, and then wait and see how the other results go. "In spite of how badly things have gone in the Champions League, we are still fortunate enough to be able to qualify. So it's up to us."	Sergio Aguero says he can understand why Manchester City have been criticised this season, but expects their form to quickly improve.
Media playback is not supported on this device Platini wants to restore the image of world football's governing body in the wake of serious corruption allegations. "We want a reform candidate," said FA chairman Greg Dyke. "We believe he will reform Fifa in the way that reform is needed." Sepp Blatter has already announced he will quit as Fifa president, with an election set for 26 February. Frenchman Platini, president of European football governing body Uefa, is likely to face a number of challengers, among them Prince Ali Bin al-Hussein of Jordan and Liberian FA president Musa Bility. Dyke added: "We understand there will be a number of candidates, which should result in a strong and healthy debate. "However, we should not underestimate how challenging it will be for anyone to lead an organisation that has been so tainted. The whole structure of Fifa must be reviewed and fundamentally changed." Platini has found himself at odds with the FA over Qatar's successful bid to host the 2022 World Cup. The 60-year-old championed the Gulf nation despite concerns over its human rights record and severe summer temperatures. But Dyke attempted to play down any differences for the time being, saying: "Mr Platini has always made it very clear that he voted for Qatar. "If all the other people who voted for Qatar had been quite as transparent it would have been more helpful." Not everyone shares the FA's confidence in Platini, a former France international who won the coveted Ballon d'Or three times. Just hours after confirming his candidacy on Wednesday, he was criticised by two potential presidential rivals. Prince Ali and Bility both claim Platini would be a bad choice as a successor. Prince Ali, who stood against Blatter in the last presidential election, said that "football's fans and players deserve better". A member of the Jordanian royal family, he added that Fifa needed a "new, independent leadership, untainted by the practices of the past". Bility agreed, telling the BBC's World Football programme that Platini would bring "chaos", "more division" and "more problems".	The English Football Association has given its backing to Michel Platini's bid to become the next boss of Fifa.
Heinrich Boere, who is in a wheelchair, was taken by ambulance from his nursing home in Germany to a prison hospital. He was sentenced in March 2010 after confessing to the killings. A German court rejected an appeal against his jail term and a medical expert said he was fit to serve his sentence at a "suitable" facility. During his trial, Boere had admitted to the killings in 1944, but said he had been acting on orders from his superiors. He shot dead Fritz Bicknese, a chemist and father of 12; Frans Kusters, a Dutch resistance member who owned a bicycle shop; and Teun de Groot, who helped Jews go into hiding. Boere argued that he risked being sent to a concentration camp if he refused to carry out the shootings. "At no time in 1944 did I act with the feeling that I was committing a crime," he told the court during his trial, but added that 65 years later he saw things from a different perspective. The presiding judge, Gerd Nohl, said all three killings had been carried out "on a totally random basis" and constituted murder. Boere was born in Germany to a Dutch father and a German mother but grew up in the Dutch town of Maastricht. He joined the Waffen SS when the Nazis overran his hometown in 1940. In 1947 he escaped from a prisoner of war camp in the Netherlands and returned to Germany. A tribunal in Amsterdam sentenced him to death for the killings in his absence in 1949, but this was later commuted to life in prison. He was never extradited and a German court ruled in the 1980s that the Dutch trial had been unfair because Boere had not been present. In April 2008, more than 60 years after the killings, he was indicted in Germany. After legal arguments about whether he was well enough to stand trial he was eventually convicted last year.	A 90-year-old man has begun a life sentence for shooting dead three Dutch civilians when he was a member of a Nazi SS hit squad during World War II.
Bert Davidson, from Hopeman, near Elgin, had not seen his 1929 Humber since he sold it nearly 60 years ago. But a few years ago he was contacted by Robin Wills - whose father had owned the saloon car in the 1960s and 70s - who had tracked it down to America. Mr Wills has since restored the dilapidated car to its former glory. After towing it up to Elgin from his home in Brancepath, County Durham, Mr Davidson once again got a chance to sit behind the wheel. "I had a run around the block in it. I thoroughly enjoyed the trip," Mr Davidson told the BBC News website. "It was a grand motor car and he's done a magnificent job restoring it. The paintwork is in its original colours. The interior is all original. He tried to get me to drive it - but I said 'I'd better not!'" Mr Davidson had first come across the car at an old coachbuilders in Elgin while working at his father's garage following his National Service in 1954. It was under a dustsheet and he asked the owner if he could buy it. "He said 'No laddie, I'm not selling it'," Mr Davidson said. "I asked him again eight weeks later. This went on for two years. Eventually he said I could have it and he asked how much I had in my pocket. I got it for Â£15 which was a bargain." Mr Davidson restored the car and in 1959 entered it in the Kildrummy Rally, where vehicles travelled from Kildrummy to Aberdeen. He won the vintage class. "I was the only kilted competitor," he said. Eventually, Mr Davidson's father sold his garage and he had nowhere to keep the car so it had to go. "I sold the car to a man from RAF Kinloss or Lossiemouth for Â£185," Mr Davidson recalled. "I watched him drive away and put it completely out of my mind. That was the last I saw of it until Robin got in touch 55-60 years later. "I was very surprised when he got in touch and I am delighted that I'm going to see the car again." Mr Wills' father bought the car in about 1965 but sold it to a Newcastle car dealer in 1974, when Mr Wills was aged four. The next time Mr Wills saw it, it was when it appeared in the opening credits of the 1976 Likely Lads film. "It's unique because it has an owl on the front, on the top of the radiator," he said. "So I knew it was the same car." Mr Wills' research, which took two years, revealed that the car was later bought by a man who took it to America and it had crossed the Atlantic four times. It was also owned by the man's brother, Lotus designer Martin Waide. However, after its engine blew up in 1979 it was never driven again until Mr Wills brought it back to its former glory. "I used to talk to my dad about the car in my teenage years as I had fond memories of it," he said. "I was delighted and astounded to find it. When I got it back the first thing I did was to open the door, shut my eyes and took a whiff. "It has the original interior. It hasn't been touched in 98 years. The smell was astounding. It was as if I had been transported back to 1974." The Humber had some plaques inside it relating to the Kildrummy Rally. Mr Wills carried out an internet search and found footage of the rally, which included Mr Davidson and the car, on the National Library of Scotland's Moving Image Archive. "I couldn't believe it," he said. "It was as if someone had walked on my grave. It was an incredible experience." He then managed to track Mr Davidson down. "The sense of excitement in his voice was unbelievable," Mr Wills said. "I think he was as excited as I was." The two men discovered they had more in common than the Humber - they also shared the same birthday. For Mr Davidson's 80th, Mr Wills sent him the car's original front number plate which the pensioner had made. "I thought that was great," Mr Davidson said. The journey to northern Scotland with the car on Saturday was wet at times, forcing Mr Wills to make an emergency stop to buy brass polish. "I had to buff up the brasswork. I wanted it to look its best for Bert," he said. "It's been an amazing experience. I feel a bit like Doctor Who, travelling back to meet characters from the past." The Humber's owners, past and present, exchanged gifts - a photo album of the car and a bottle of whisky from Mr Davidson's home town of Elgin.	An 83-year-old man has been reunited with a vintage car he drove in the 1950s, after its current owner tracked him down.
Faull was part of the famous British and Irish Lions side who beat New Zealand in Auckland in 1959. He made 12 appearances for Wales and played in four of the six Tests in the 1959 Lions tour. He also played three times for the Barbarians. John was also the son of former international referee and former president of the Welsh Rugby Union, Wilf Faull.	Former Wales and British and Irish Lion John Faull has died aged 83.
The hosts claimed Australia's last five wickets for 44 runs on Friday morning to bowl them out for 308 and secure a first-innings lead of 122. Ian Bell and Joe Root both scored 60 and Ben Stokes 42 as England surged further ahead in the afternoon session to the delight of a buoyant Cardiff crowd. And although wickets fell regularly in a frenetic finale, Mark Wood's unbeaten 32 helped England reach 289 all out to set Australia an improbable 412 to win. Only two teams in Test history have successfully chased that many runs, with Australia's best effort the 404-3 by Don Bradman's 'Invincibles' at Headingley in 1948. England set the tone for a near-perfect day with an electric performance on the third morning, executing their plans to perfection to finish off the Australia innings. Shane Watson's vulnerability to lbws was brilliantly exploited as Stuart Broad dismissed him for 30 in the second over of the day before Wood pinned Nathan Lyon in front of his stumps. James Anderson found swing with the new ball to induce edges from Brad Haddin and Mitchell Starc, with Broad removing Mitchell Johnson in between. In little more than an hour, England had advanced from a position of relative strength to one of total control. After a nervy start with the bat - failures for Alastair Cook and Gary Ballance left England teetering on 22-2 - their second innings found momentum. Adam Lyth showed his mettle with a fluent 37, but the main catalyst was Bell, who put a dreadful sequence of 56 runs in nine innings behind him with a fine half-century. The Warwickshire batsman went on the front foot from the off, lashing two cover drives in one Mitchell Starc over and peppering the third-man boundary with his trademark late cut. He reached fifty off 75 balls, and underlined his new-found confidence by crashing Johnson over cover for his 11th four. The next ball brought Bell's undoing however, as, clearly expecting the short ball, he backed away slightly and was clean bowled to give Johnson his first wicket of the match. By the time of Bell's dismissal, England were flying and the in-form duo of Root and Stokes kept them airborne, with both finding the boundary nine times. A mini-collapse from 207-4 to 245-8 in the last session gave Australia a glimmer of hope, only for England to find inspiration from an unlikely source. Swinging from the hip, Wood took the lead role in a 43-run partnership for the ninth wicket with Moeen Ali and was still at the crease when Anderson became Lyon's fourth victim in the very last action of the day. England's brilliance has set up the possibility of a four-day finish, and the hosts would be wise to do their utmost to wrap things up on Saturday because of heavy showers forecast for Sunday. Australia will no doubt still fancy their chances of pulling off a record-breaking victory, but in reality the Welsh weather represents their best chance of avoiding going into next week's second Test at Lord's 1-0 down. Australia spinner Nathan Lyon: "We're definitely still in it. If we bat two days the result will go our way. There's no reason why we can't dig deep. "We've got to learn from our first innings with the bat - be more patient. There were too many 30s in the first innings, so we need to try and push on a bit more and have a couple of our top five get big hundreds." England batsman Ian Bell: "There are no gimmes and we expect more tomorrow. We are going to have to work hard to win."	England hammered home their advantage over Australia in the first Test on a fast-moving third day to put themselves in pole position to take the lead in the Ashes.
While the club investigates Pearson's behaviour for unspecified reasons, contact between the manager and Rams staff is not allowed. Powell, Pearson's assistant, led Derby to victory at Cardiff hours after his boss was removed from his role and be in charge at Reading on Saturday. "It's a situation that no one wants to be in," Powell told BBC Radio Derby. "But in this game that we love, we know that things change and happen and we have to do our best to move on, take care of what is happening now and try to plan for the future - and the immediate future is Reading on Saturday." Beyond the weekend, however, Powell admits he does not know what will happen. Since Pearson's suspension, first-team manager Inigo Idiakez has also left the club. "We have to get on with the job in hand." Powell said. "We have a responsibility to carry on with the jobs we do and make the sure the team is focused and the players are prepared and coached in the same manner. "I am fine. I have spoken to many people at the club. I have spoken to the players most importantly. They are fine and they have to carry on."	Chris Powell has not spoken to Nigel Pearson since the Derby County manager was suspended by the club on Tuesday.
Jason Duff was discovered falling in and out of consciousness on Bo'ness Road in Polmont, Stirlingshire on 31 May last year. The case was described by a prosecutor as one with "unusual circumstances". The 44-year-old, of Cowdenbeath, Fife, was also banned from driving for four years. Depute fiscal Siobhan Monks said a member of the public was driving along the road when he came across Duff's 15-year-old Peugeot 206. Miss Monks said the Peugeot engine was running, but the vehicle was stationary, and Duff was not in it. The other motorist stopped and found Duff "lying in the road, under the influence, with his trousers down, falling in and out of consciousness". A blood sample taken at Forth Valley Royal Hospital three hours later showed Duff was still over twice the legal drink drive limit. Duff told police he had drunk alcohol and slept in his car following an argument with his girlfriend. Miss Monks said that when Duff woke up he decided to drive to work, but felt unwell, stopped his car and got out, but could remember nothing more. Solicitor advocate Stephen Biggam, defending, said: "He had become dehydrated, that's why he passed out." Duff pleaded guilty at Falkirk Sheriff Court to a charge of drink-driving. In addition to the driving ban and unpaid work order, Sheriff John Mundy placed Duff under social work supervision for 18 months. He said: "This is a serious matter. "The court does have the power to impose a custodial sentence, but it would be better for you to receive some kind of structured support."	A drink driver found by another motorist lying in the road with his trousers down has been ordered to carry out 200 hours of unpaid work.
17 August 2017 Last updated at 07:56 BST It seems to have the body parts from different dino species. This new finding gives more of an idea of how the group of dinosaurs, known as the Ornithischians, evolved over the years. So what do you get when you cross a plant eating dino, like Stegosaurus, with a meat eating one, like T. Rex?  Ayshah?	Scientists have discovered a new type of dinosaur.
Condor Liberation - which sails between Poole in Dorset and the Channel Islands - struck the quayside at St Peter Port, Guernsey. The vessel, which is meant to be more resistant to heavy seas, has been out of service for repairs since the crash on 28 March. An investigation is continuing into the accident. While the ferry was out of service, the MV Arrow was brought in to carry freight while the Commodore Clipper and the Condor Express carried passengers.	A £50m ferry that was damaged in high winds on its second day in service has been repaired and is back in operation.
Imran Khawaja tried to sneak back into the UK last year - and while his exact activity in Syria remains a mystery, police say he is one of the most dangerous British jihadists to return from conflict. He was one of the most public British fighters in Syria - always online, but always masked. But now, Imran Khawaja, 27, from Southall, west London is facing a possible prison term up to life imprisonment for his role in life and death on Syria's battlefields. Khawaja left the UK last January. He called himself Abu Daigham al-Britani. And after reaching the warzone via Kurdish territory, he began posting videos and pictures of his personal jihad. In one video he explains how a fellow fighter was shot through the side - but "thanks to Allah's will" was soon back on the front line. In another - masked again - he is showing off his amateur weight-lifting skills as his brothers-in-arms cheer him on. Khawaja was a member of Rayat al Tawheed - which means Flag of Unity. The group of fighters affiliated to Islamic State includes many British men, and they have spent more than a year selling a message to their supporters and would-be recruits back home. Khawaja was involved in appeals for donations, video diaries of their lives  and "through the keyhole" tours of fighters' quarters. Shiraz Maher, of the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation (ICSR), at Kings College London, has been tracking foreign fighters in Syria and Iraq. He says: "The group that Khawaja was with in Syria was really quite dynamic," he says. "They clearly had people with programming skills - they were able to put together very slick, well produced propaganda videos and posters that appealed to young British Muslims. "They were able to play on the same cultural anchors and mores that those people recognised and know. They could speak to them as peers. "Rayat al Tawheed helped a great deal in the early stages of this conflict with portraying the idea of volunteering as a jihadist as quite a glamorous adventurous thing - and a noble thing." But Rayat's war was neither noble nor glamorous. Some of its material online showed gruesome scenes of death. One image showed a man's bloodied-hands with the caption "my first time". And another shocking image included Imran Khawaja. In this gruesome picture, the Londoner - masked yet again - is holding a bag that contains a head. The only thing we know about the victim is that he was supposedly a Syrian army soldier. But we do know that the British security service MI5 was watching - and waiting. And last June, its opportunity came. Imran Khawaja decided to come home. It's not clear why because he hasn't told the police. His cousin Tahir Bhatti, a taxi driver from Watford, agreed to help him return because the family wanted him back safely. Khawaja's own intentions are unclear. He had originally asked his cousin for money for a new gun - something Bhatti did not help him with. And then the fighter began trying to cover his tracks. As Bhatti, who has admitted assisting an offender, drove to Bulgaria to pick him up, Khawaja faked his own death with an online obituary that said he had died in battle. The announcement asked that Allah grant him the highest position in heaven. He then tried to slip back into Britain unnoticed. As the pair arrived at Dover, the police were waiting - and they ended up facing prosecution at the Old Bailey. Cdr Richard Walton, the head of the Metropolitan Police's counter-terrorism command, says: "Imran Khawaja is not a vulnerable teenager who has been enticed to travel to Syria. "This is a man who chosen the path of terrorism, who has chosen to go out to Syria to be trained and engage in a terrorist training camp. "We don't know why he came back, we don't know what he was planning - but we know he concealed his entry and faked his own death. This is a dangerous man." Imran Khawaja was considered so dangerous that while he was on remand, he was held in the special unit for high risk terrorism suspects at London's maximum security Belmarsh prison. He has admitted four offences: Tahir Bhatti has pleaded guilty to assisting an offender. Khawaja had originally faced an additional charge of soliciting to murder. That allegation, the most serious to be made yet against a Syrian fighter, will lie on file.	A British man who went to fight in Syria - and then faked his own death in order to secretly return - has pleaded guilty to four major terrorism offences at the Old Bailey.
President Barack Obama said it was a "step towards a more normal and productive relationship". But he may face a battle in Congress where some Republicans are opposed to his dealings with the communist island. The new ambassador, Jeffrey DeLaurentis, had been working at the new US embassy in Havana, which opened in July last year. President Obama said there was "no better-qualified public servant". President Obama and Cuba's President Raul Castro have begun to reignite the diplomatic relations that were broken off in 1961 after the Caribbean island's communist revolution. What next for Washington and Havana? What is behind the US-Cuba thaw? In pictures: US-Cuban relations Restrictions on flights have been lifted but the US embargo on Cuba remains in place. Republican Senator Marco Rubio, who is Cuban-American, has previously said the improved relations will go "a long way in providing the economic lift that the Castro regime needs to become permanent fixtures in Cuba for generations to come''.	The US has appointed its first ambassador to Cuba in 55 years as relations between the countries thaw.
The man was arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to intercept voicemail messages and attempting to pervert the course of justice. The arrest took place by appointment at a north London police station; the man is in police custody. He has been bailed to a date in mid January 2012. He was arrested by officers from Scotland Yard's fresh investigation into phone hacking, Operation Weeting. On Tuesday, a 71-year-old Stuart Kuttner, an ex-News of the World managing editor, was rearrested and bailed as part of the phone-hacking probe. Mr Kuttner was originally arrested on 2 August on suspicion of conspiring to intercept communications and corruption, and bailed. He has now been bailed to a date in September, the Metropolitan Police said. The Met's Operation Weeting is investigating illegal hacking of the mobile phone voicemails of public figures by the now-defunct News of the World newspaper. The latest arrest is the 15th to be made on suspicion of phone hacking since Operation Weeting was launched in January. It happened just after midday. BBC home affairs correspondent Tom Symonds said the age of the arrested person suggested someone more junior compared to some of the more senior executives who have been arrested by the police so far. It is a long-running investigation and there would almost certainly be further arrests, our correspondent added. Former News International chief executive Rebekah Brooks and ex-Downing Street communications chief Andy Coulson are among those who have already been arrested as part of the inquiry. The scandal has led Met Police Commissioner Sir Paul Stephenson and Assistant Commissioner John Yates to resign, and the News of the World to close down after 168 years.	A 30-year-old man has been released on bail after being arrested by police investigating phone hacking at the News of the World.

He said: "This is a massive club and there's a massive opportunity for the club to push on. "I've been lucky enough to have a really good career, but there's still a lot more I want to achieve." Cole, who also played for Chelsea, Liverpool and on loan at Lille, is Villa's second signing of the summer. Manager Paul Lambert has also signed former Arsenal defender Philippe Senderos on a free transfer from Valencia.	Aston Villa have signed former England midfielder Joe Cole on a two-year contract.
The concert was held amid tight security at the heavily protected Intercontinental Hotel. It was a rare music concert in the city. Kabul has witnessed a series of suicide attacks and explosions in the past few months. Saturday evening's concert was originally scheduled to be held in Ghazi stadium to mark the country's Independence Day. More than 3,000 tickets were sold at premium rates. But the authorities said they could not guarantee security at that venue. Ms Sayeed did not give up. She went ahead with her performance, but at a different venue. Her fans were delighted. "Despite the threats, I didn't think such a big number of girls would attend here. Fortunately, the number of women is bigger than men," said Bahar Sohaili, who attended the concert.. "I asked some of the girls: 'Why you are here?' They told me they were here to defy those who were against the concert." Ms Sayeed, described by her fans as Afghanistan's Kim Kardashian, is known for her long hair and figure-hugging outfits, which are seen as taboo by many in Afghanistan. Her music mixes traditional and folk songs rendered as pop. She sings both in Dari and Pashto, Afghanistan's two main languages. A day before the concert, I interviewed Ms Sayeed. She said she was determined to go ahead with the concert, despite the threats. "I am taking this as a very good excuse to be able to give a bit of happiness to my fellow Afghans, who are in dire need of it at the moment," she said. She has received a number of death threats from those who say her outfits and public shows are an affront to Afghan culture. "There are certain people in Afghanistan who have been against music, against celebration, against even New Year, Eid and everything. I feel like today we need to stand together and fight against it," said Ms Sayeed. "At the end of the day, we are also human beings and these are basic human needs - music, celebration, Independence Day, New Year." Ms Sayeed said she would donate the proceeds from the concert to the families of those killed by Islamist militants in an attack on the village of Mirza Olong in northern Sar-e-Pul province.	Hundreds of young men and women attended a concert by Afghan pop star Aryana Sayeed in the capital Kabul despite opposition from conservatives, and threats of an attack.

Sir Peter Blake received Liverpool's Citizen of Honour at a ceremony at the city's Liver building. The 84-year-old also gave Mersey ferry Snowdrop a dazzle ship makeover entitled Everybody Razzle Dazzle. Sir Peter, who was born in Kent, said he hopes Liverpool people will accept him as an "honorary Scouser". Lord Mayor of Liverpool Roz Gladden said: "Sir Peter has helped shape Liverpool's cultural significance on the global stage for more than five decades - from Sgt Pepper to Everybody Razzle Dazzle. "His work with The Beatles was one of the seminal moments in popular art in the 20th Century and 50 years on still resonates around the world as we will see with our 50 Summers of Love programme." She said he had continued to make outstanding contributions to the cultural life of the city "underlining the depth of feeling he has for Liverpool and the city has for him". Sir Peter said: "As well as my music links with the city, I'm proud of my association with Liverpool Biennial and Tate Liverpool and hope to continue my relationship with the city." He said he treasures "the warmth and good humour of the people of Liverpool". Citizen of Honour awards were introduced in 2008 to recognise individuals who have enriched the image of Liverpool and its citizens. Recent recipients include James Barton, founder of the nightclub brand Cream, and Harry Potter and Fantastic Beasts film director David Yates. The Snowdrop ferry was due to be returned to its original paintwork at the end of 2016 but it has been extended until 2019.	The artist who created the album cover for The Beatles' Sgt Pepper album has been given a top honour in the band's home city.
The Bulls' fate has been in the balance since the full extent of their financial worries emerged in the weeks since their dramatic final-day escape sent Chester down instead. Chester have been reinstated as a Conference Premier club and Hayes & Yeading will stay in Conference South. "Hereford United can have no complaints. The Conference bent over backwards to help them. "I described the news of the board's offer of an extension on Friday evening as not so much 'last chance saloon', but rather 'last orders in last chance saloon' and United have seemingly chosen not to offer the league the assurances they were seeking. "It is a desperately sad day for all Hereford supporters, but the Bulls have nobody to blame but themselves. "You have to feel very sorry for those players who gave their all at Aldershot on the last day of the season to keep Hereford in the Conference Premier. Sadly, those efforts now count for nothing." The Conference had originally offered a payment deadline of Thursday, 5 June. The club's debt to their football creditors, including former boss Martin Foyle, members of the current squad, other club staff and clubs from whom the Bulls loaned players during the 2013-14 season, added up to £148,000. That deadline was extended three times, to Friday, 6 June, then again to Saturday, 7 June and for a third time until Thursday, 12 June. But it became clear on Tuesday that the Bulls, taken over last week by London businessman Tommy Agombar, would not make that deadline - and the Conference has now acted. The last team to be expelled from the Conference was Chester City in February 2010. They reformed as Chester FC two months later - and it is now they who have taken the Bulls' place, following a dramatic final day of the season when, almost simultaneously, a late Hereford winning goal at Aldershot and a Salisbury equaliser at Chester kept the Bulls up. By way of an added twist, Chester announced on Tuesday that Kingsley James, who was in Hereford's team that day, has moved to Bumpers Lane. 26 April - Hereford stay up on final day of Conference Premier season 29 April - Hereford United Supporters' Trust make offer to buy the club for £1 and clear their £220,000 debts 22 May -  Former Bulls boss Martin Foyle serves winding-up petition over unpaid wages, after players reveal they have not been fully paid too 2 June - Case adjourned for 28 days at Royal Court of Justice 3 June - Tommy Agombar takes over as new Hereford owner 5 June - Hereford fail to meet 17:00 BST deadline to pay football creditors, and are threatened with expulsion, subject to Conference board vote 6 June - Hereford meet with Conference board and are given new deadline of 7 June. The deadline is moved to 9 June, then 12 June 10 June - Hereford expelled from Football Conference And former Hereford boss Foyle, now manager at Southport, chose the same day to sign another player from that same Bulls team, keeper Dan Lloyd-Weston, who opted to leave as he was still owed part of his salary. When last season ended, despite months of fundraising efforts by fans, as well as generous donations from fans of other clubs, the Bulls faced debts of approximately £225,000. They still owe over £70,000 to clear the latest PAYE tax demand from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC). An offer was made by one of the club's main fan bodies, the Hereford United Supporters' Trust (HUST), on the back of pledges made by their backers, to buy the club for £1 and take over the running at Edgar Street. But, although chairman David Keyte held talks with them, they were not the preferred option. Keyte was reported to have been in talks with three different rival bidders before Agombar's takeover. The downward spiral of Hereford's financial situation since being relegated from the Football League in May 2012 has been exacerbated by falling gates. The average attendance for the 2013-14 season at Edgar Street was 1,758, little over half the average gate they attracted of 3,270 in League Two just five years ago.	Hereford United have been expelled from the Football Conference following the club's failure to pay their bills.
The powdery white beaches of Zanzibar's east coast are best known as a holiday destination. But each day, as the tide begins to ebb and the beachgoers return to their hotels, a small army of men and women armed with sticks and spears wade out across the coastal flats in search of one of the Tanzanian island's finest delicacies - octopus. During a single low tide a skilled octopus hunter can spear more than 10 of the slimy invertebrates, which thrive amid the maze of rocks, corals and sea grass that lie beyond the beaches. The catch is highly prized by the island's tourist hotels and provides an important source of protein for coastal communities. Protected by an offshore reef, the tidal flats off the island's east coast provide livelihoods and sustenance for local residents, in the form of fish, crabs, shellfish, seaweed and octopus. Tanzania is the largest producer of octopus in the western Indian Ocean. Abdullah Ali, 35, prepares to launch his traditional wooden boat on an octopus hunting expedition from Dongwe village. Traditionally a female-dominated activity, more men are now turning to octopus for a source of income. "The octopus has helped me to drive my life forward," said Ali, who makes about £1.90 ($2.30) per kg (2lb 3oz) for his octopuses. According to data from the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation, catches in Tanzania have increased from 482 tonnes in 1990 to more than 1,250 in 2012. The mix of jagged rocks and corals near the reef offer many places for the octopuses to hide at low tide, becoming almost invisible to the untrained eye. Thousands of sea urchins provide a further challenge. Mariam, an octopus hunter from Bwejuu village, plunges into the water to cool off after a morning's work. Mama Juma, a seasoned octopus hunter, scans the crystal clear water near Paje beach for likely octopus hideouts. A lone woman searches for octopus in the evening beyond a seaweed farm at Bwejuu. Local communities derive much of their livelihood from the intertidal flats. Grilled octopus is a staple at the nightly seafood market in Stone Town. Most of mainland Tanzania's octopus catch is exported to Europe, but on the island of Zanzibar tourism has provided a booming market.

For most footballers, the recovery time they get after training and between matches usually means plenty of golf, or computer games. But saving birds by re-homing them after they have finished their commercial lives is what keeps Wales international Allen busy. "The football can threaten to take over at times but spending time with my family and pets is very important to me so I always find a way to get the right balance," he told the British Hen Welfare Trust publication. Media playback is not supported on this device Allen, though, isn't the only professional player using his downtime in a different way. Arsenal goalkeeper Cech fills his time by performing fills - on his drum kit. The Czech Republic international posts videos online showing him drumming along to rock bands like the Foo Fighters. He credits drumming with improving his keeping skills too, recently telling the Arsenal Weekly podcast: "It is especially useful for a goalkeeper. There are so many things I learn on the drums that I can use in goalkeeping as well, because the hand-eye coordination and the independence on each of the limbs is helpful." Cech showed off his musical skills in a Christmas video for the Arsenal foundation, alongside team-mates Alexis Sanchez and Nacho Monreal. Media playback is not supported on this device The former Liverpool defender is now playing back home in Denmark, at Brondby. The prototype inked footballer was one of the first to sport tattoo sleeves but is also capable of etching his designs onto others - he's a qualified tattoo artist. The Russian ex-Arsenal forward is still playing for Kairat at the age of 34, but when his career ends he can still fall back on the fashion design skills he learned at university, where his thesis was on tracksuit design. Turns out he's pretty handy with a needle and thread, too. Tottenham and Manchester United fans used to say he was an artist when he played in the Premier League. Now playing for PAOK in Greece, the Bulgarian striker is as deft with a pencil in his hand as he is with the ball at his feet. He has posted sketches of rapper Snoop Dogg, actor Marlon Brando and the Breaking Bad cast to his social media accounts. The Everton full-back, 35, has not made a first-team appearance this season, which will have given him more time to focus on his carp fishing empire. Like Allen, Hibbert was a cover star of a non-football magazine - the Angling Times - in 2013 after catching a 42lb beast at his private fishery in France - the aptly named Lac de Premiere. An ex-Millwall centre-half with a love of felines. The 37-year-old former Premier League defender is now captain at League Two Yeovil Town, but has a family business on the side - a cattery in Hertfordshire. BBC Sport visited the cats home in 2011 and Ward said: "Playing for Millwall you've got to be thick-skinned. You do get some eyebrows raised and a few giggles." Put a plate full of wild mushrooms in front of ex-Barcelona and Spain great Xavi Hernandez, and he'll be able to name every one. The 36-year-old, now with Al Sadd in Qatar, loves nothing more than foraging for fungi - or to give it its official term: mycology. Have you added the new Top Story alerts in the BBC Sport app?

Thirty specialist staff will be appointed across Wales to look after women with prenatal and postnatal mental health illnesses. Community-based teams will include doctors, nursing staff and other healthcare professionals. Mind Cymru said around 30% of parents suffer anxiety or depression in the first year after their baby's birth. The funding announcement comes as a conference on developing perinatal mental health services was being held in Cardiff. Health Minister Mark Drakeford said: "It's vital that we support mental wellbeing before, during and after pregnancy and support women who are at high risk of developing mental health problems as close to their homes as is practical and safe for both mother and baby. "We want mothers and their families to have a positive experience so they can feel confident, capable and well-supported during pregnancy and the first weeks and months of bringing their new baby into the world."	Mental health services to help women during and after birth have received a £1.5m boost from the Welsh Government.
The Greens pledged to end "period poverty" by providing towels and tampons to secondary school pupils and women in financial need. A 5% tax on sanitary products has caused controversy and 320,000 people have signed a petition to abolish it. The pledge may be funded by a tax on airship sales and aircraft repairs. Sanitary products are not exempt from VAT, as some medical products are. Campaigns to end the tax on them have taken place in countries across the globe. In the UK, a further row broke out in April when it was revealed some of the money raised from the tax and promised by the government to women's charities had been given to an anti-abortion group. Of the Â£12m given to 70 UK charities, Â£250,000 had gone to Life. Green MEP Molly Scott Cato, who has pressed in the European Parliament for a VAT exemption on tampons, towels and mooncups, said it was an "outrage those on low incomes are forced to use socks or newspapers during their period because they can't afford a sanitary product". Children in secondary school from low-income backgrounds were routinely missing days at school, she said. The Green Party said it wanted to work with health companies to provide the free products. It will look at funding them by taxing other products and services such as air craft repairs and maintenance and airship sales.	Free sanitary products for those who cannot afford them have been promised by the Green Party of England and Wales.
Warren, 79, who started the Granada Television show when he was 24, died on 1 March after a short illness. His coffin was carried into the cathedral by members of the cast, watched by the crowds outside. Among those who attended the service were Julie Goodyear and William Roache, who has played Ken Barlow since the first episode in 1960. Goodyear, famous for playing barmaid Bet Lynch, paid a heartfelt tribute to Warren, a friend of 50 years. "We cried together and we laughed together," she said. Canon Philip Barratt said all the hymns and readings at the funeral, which was also open to members of the public, were chosen by Warren. "It's a big service for a very big character and a lovely part of the history of Manchester," he said. Former stars in the congregation included Ken Morley, who played Reg Holdsworth, and Christopher Quinten, best known for his role as mechanic Brian Tilsley. Warren was born Anthony McVay Simpson in Eccles, Salford, in 1937, and took the stage name of Warren during his career as a child star. He trained at Liverpool's Elliott Clarke Theatre School and was a regular on the BBC radio show Children's Hour, before acting in radio plays alongside some of the actors who would became household names because of Coronation Street, including Violet Carson and Doris Speed. His idea for the soap opera was commissioned for 13 episodes by Granada in 1960 and the show has gone on to be one of the UK's most successful ever, reaching viewing figures of 26.6 million for the departure of the much-loved character Hilda Ogden in 1987. He wrote episodes for the ITV soap until the late 1970s and was made an MBE in 1994 for his services to television drama. The writer remained a consultant on the soap until his death, with his creator credit appearing at the start of the closing credits of every episode.	The funeral of Coronation Street creator and writer Tony Warren has taken place at Manchester Cathedral.
After the mansion's contents were removed and charred timbers were carefully lifted out by crane, an archaeological salvage operation got under way which will continue until the spring. Some of the first photographs of the ornate carvings saved by archaeological experts are shown here:	Since a devastating fire hit 18th Century Clandon Park in Surrey, reducing it to a shell, more than 400 objects have been salvaged from the burnt-out remains - but work continues on the fabric of the building itself.
She announced the arrival of Albert Louie Kenny on Instagram, with a photo of her alongside husband Jason - a six-time Olympic gold medallist. She said he was born late on Wednesday, a week over his due date. "Welcome to the world little Albert Louie Kenny. 23/08/17 8lb 12.5oz 22.44. You kept us waiting a week but it was all worth it," she wrote. The 25-year-old, whose hometown is Cheshunt in Hertfordshire, retained the team pursuit and women's omnium titles in Rio that she won at London 2012. She has already declared her intention to compete at a third Olympic Games in Tokyo in 2020 but has said she will not rush back to the sport. Jason has seven Olympic track sprint medals to his name - including six golds - making him the holder of the most titles for a Briton alongside former team-mate Sir Chris Hoy. The relationship between the pair began during the build-up to the London 2012 Olympic Games and they married in Cheshire in September. Friend and fellow cyclist Dani King tweeted she "cannot wait to meet him". While Paralympic cyclist Dame Sarah Storey - who is expecting her second child - said it was "lovely news". End of Twitter post  by @DaniKing1	Four-time Olympic cycling champion Laura Kenny has given birth to her first child.
Habtom Zerhom was first shot by a security guard at a bus station in Beersheba and then kicked and beaten by a crowd as he lay in a pool of blood. A post-mortem examination found he died of bullet wounds - not the beating. Officials said a prison officer, a soldier and two civilians were charged with aggravated battery. Mobile footage on 18 October showed an angry crowd surrounding Mr Zerhom as he was lying injured on the floor, under a stool held over him by a member of security. A set of chairs was then dumped on his head before he was kicked by the mob. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu later urged Israelis not to take justice into their own hands. The beating happened at the time of a deadly attack by an Israeli Arab at the same place in Beersheba. That attacker killed an Israeli soldier and wounded 10 other people. The gunman was later shot dead. Initial reports said two people had attacked the bus station in the southern Israeli city. Twenty-two Israelis Israel have been killed in a wave of stabbings, shootings and car rammings by Palestinians since October, officials say. The Palestinian health ministry says 149 Palestinians have been killed in that time. More than half were said by Israel to be attackers. Others have been killed in clashes with Israeli forces.	Four Israelis have been charged over the beating of an Eritrean migrant who was mistaken for a gunman during a militant attack last October.
Vicente del Bosque's European champions had 64% possession in Alicante, as full-back Mario Gaspar scored a stunning acrobatic goal. "I thought the result flattered them, even though they had a lot of the ball," said centre-back Cahill. England's friendly against France on Tuesday goes ahead after the terrorist attacks which took place in Paris. Read more: Cahill continued: "For 70 minutes, I thought we were well in the game but goals change games. It was a special goal and it opened it up. We knew it was going to be tough and knew the ability they had." It was a first defeat since the 2014 World Cup for England, who went through Euro 2016 qualifying with a 100% record. "People need to stay patient," said Tottenham striker Harry Kane. "We're not going to win every game. We're playing these teams for a reason, to get experience. "We've got to stay confident. We know what we want to do and what we want to achieve."	Defender Gary Cahill believes England were not outclassed in their 2-0 friendly defeat by Spain on Friday.
The two sides have been without a binding deal since the previous one expired in June. Wales and British and Irish Lions lock Jones hopes the players can now concentrate on the new season. "Ultimately as players we've prepared as if it's a normal season and everything's rosy," Jones said. "I do stress it's not been ideal and it's not a distraction, but all the same it will be nice to have it done because we've heard for the last 18 months, potentially two years, that this is going to be sorted. "I commend both sides for doing so but it's just disappointing it's taken so long." We've got to move forward with the players that we've got and that's what we intend to do A new deal between the WRU and Cardiff Blues, Newport Gwent Dragons, Scarlets and Jones' own Ospreys is expected to be signed this week and the 28-year-old added jokingly: "Apparently there was white smoke coming out of the top of the Millennium Stadium, which bodes well!" Jones, who has won 80 caps for Wales and six for the Lions, is one of nine players tipped to become dual-contracted under the proposed new deal. Ospreys begin their season on Friday, 5 September at home to Treviso in the Guinness Pro12, while they will also face the Italians in the Champions Cup in October in a pool including Northampton and Racing Metro. The Welsh side have seen senior players of the calibre of Richard Hibbard, Ian Evans and Ryan Jones - all Lions - leave for other clubs in the off-season. Jones is hoping that players will emerge from within Ospreys to swell the ranks. "[It is a] pretty big [hole], particularly in the pack. You also look at [fly-half] Matthew Morgan going which was one of our shining lights coming through," Jones said. "Obviously he moved for probably different reasons that some of the other guys did, but they've all moved on and a lot has been said about the comings and goings. "As a region, a group of players and personally we wish them the best, but we've got to move forward with the players that we've got and that's what we intend to do. "The likes of Lloyd Peers, Tyler Ardron... these are guys putting their hands up in the squad. "People like myself, Duncan [Jones] and other guys, Biggs [Dan Biggar], are going to try and grab a few by the scruff of the neck and bring them along with us."	Ospreys captain Alun Wyn Jones has welcomed the news that the Welsh Rugby Union and its four regions are set to sign a new participation agreement.
Griffin Place Communications Limited, in Llantarnam, Cwmbran, employed up to 140 people, with many staff claiming they were sacked days before. Torfaen AM Lynne Neagle said the Welsh government has "serious questions to answer", while Welsh government said it would be reviewing the situation. Attempts have been made to contact the company for comment. On Friday, employees arrived at the Llantarnam offices to find the rooms empty and the doors locked. The company has notified some workers that it has commenced liquidation proceedings and many of those have claimed they are owed thousands of pounds in wages. A letter to employees from insolvency firm Finn Associates advised there will be a meeting of creditors on 13 August. Ms Neagle has arranged a public meeting for former workers on Monday at Mount Pleasant Hall in Pontnewydd. "The immediate priority now has got to be to try and support the many staff who have been devastated by this news," she said. Shadow Economy Minister William Graham said Welsh taxpayers "will rightly question" whether Welsh government's investment in the project represented value for money. Torfaen council confirmed it will be contacting seven clients employed by the company as part of the UK government's Work Programme. According to the Welsh government, support provided to the company stipulated jobs should be in place for at least three years. "We will, with immediate effect, be seeking repayment of relevant grant sums," the spokesperson added. "We have also mobilised the Welsh Contact Centre Forum, who can signpost affected staff to potential new job opportunities, and we will keep the situation under review."	A call centre in Torfaen which received £600,000 funding from the Welsh government has gone into liquidation.
The Gills, who finished 20th in League One last season, have signed eight players so far this summer. But having started the season with a 0-0 draw to Doncaster and a 2-0 loss to Reading, Pennock wants more recruits. "They've got to be the right players, the right characters and more importantly they've got to be good players," Pennock, 46, said. "Everybody is pulling together in the right direction - it's a good changing room and if we can add two or three more I'll be very happy." Although the club are still on the lookout for new additions, Pennock is pleased with those who have already arrived. Gillingham have brought in defenders Gabriel Zakuani, Luke O'Neill, Connor Ogilvie and Alex Lacey, strikers Liam Nash, Conor Wilkinson and Tom Eaves and midfielder Billy Bingham. "Overall, I'm happy with every single one of them - all of the new lads who have come in have contributed to what we've done, they've been absolutely first-class," Pennock told BBC Radio Kent. "I think it's pushed the others on who were here last year as well. The whole club at the moment is in a good place."	Gillingham are looking to add "two or three" more players to their squad, according to manager Ady Pennock.
They know him of old, of course, but for many this is a potentially new David Cameron, freshly elected with an unexpected majority. Many leaders got rather irritated with the prime minister in the long lead up to the election. They felt he played too much to the Eurosceptic gallery at home when abroad on EU business. Will this new David Cameron be a man they can work with, they wonder? They'd like to. With the UK's in/out referendum EU on membership looming large in European headlines, most want to ensure Britain stays in, especially in Germany, as I found out earlier this week on a trip to Berlin. The UK's former ambassador to Germany, Sir Peter Torry, describes the country as the best friend and ally the UK could have in its EU renegotiation. Pretty useful for Mr Cameron, as Germany is Europe's most powerful nation. There are very practical reasons why Germans are so keen to keep Britain in - and not just because they share a love for sausages and beer, as one student I chatted to suggested. German businesses appreciate Britain's free trade, single market, and anti red-tape push. They see this as a counterweight to the EU's more protectionist, interventionist countries. German taxpayers agree with the UK's drive to crack down on welfare claims by migrants. And Germany is very keen to avoid having to pay even more into the EU budget. It would end up making up most of the shortfall if the UK walked away. So there's lots of good will, but no blank cheque. I asked German MP Michael Fuchs, of Angela Merkel's CDU party, how far the Chancellor would go to help Britain. She'll offer "utmost flexibility", I was told, but there would also be red lines. There is little appetite in Germany or anywhere outside Britain for fundamental changes to existing EU treaties (for example to curb the freedom of EU citizens to live and work where they like in the EU). Though the suggestion has been made in several countries that when treaties are eventually changed to facilitate more harmony in the eurozone, that's when the UK could possibly have its own treaty-changing elements written in. But the timing looks wrong for Britain. German Finance Minister Wolgang Schaeuble says any treaty change is unlikely before the UK holds its EU referendum. But there is a widespread hunger for EU change - from the north amongst the Scandinavian countries to Europe's southern reaches. Governments realise that, with near deflation and high youth unemployment, especially in Spain, France and Italy, the EU is failing to live up to the aspirations of its almost half a billion citizens. The question for Britain's prime minister is whether the change favoured by his European partners match the changes David Cameron wants? Not all his European counterparts are prepared to be as open as Angela Merkel when it comes to UK requests. Not everyone would be as regretful as Germany if the UK were to leave. David Cameron has announced he will begin bilateral visits with his European colleagues as soon as this summit is over. They expect concrete details on what exactly Britain wants from the EU by the leaders' next summit at the end of June.	EU leaders are curious to meet the British prime minister when he joins the Eastern Partnership Summit in Riga.

Joanna Michael, 25, from St Mellons, Cardiff, rang 999 twice before Cyron Williams stabbed her to death in 2009. The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) ruled she was failed by South Wales and Gwent Police. The Supreme Court said Ms Michael's family would not be able to proceed with claims against the two forces. Ms Michael's parents and children won the right to try to bring a claim for damages against both police forces in 2011, but it was thrown out by the Court of Appeal because police officers have immunity from negligence claims. The family had hoped the Supreme Court would overrule the ruling, but were left disappointed on Wednesday when the justices sitting decided by a 5-2 majority to dismiss the family's appeal. Speaking on the steps of the court Ms Michael's mother Angela said: "I have lost a wonderful daughter. The children have lost a loving mother and provider. "I brought this case to secure damages for the children and also to make the police answerable for their failures to deal effectively with serious domestic violence cases." She added: "I take some comfort that the appeal may bring this problem to the attention of the nation. It is unacceptable in modern Britain that a doctor can kill a patient through a negligent act or omission and be liable to pay compensation, but where the police fail and someone dies, they are immune in negligence." The seven justices also unanimously dismissed a cross-appeal by the chief constables of South Wales and Gwent Police. The forces wanted to block the appeal court judges' linked ruling that the family should be allowed to go ahead with a claim that their Article 2 rights under the European Convention on Human Rights were breached by a police failure to protect Joanna's life. Reading out the judgement, Lord Neuberger passed on his "considerable sympathy" for Ms Michael's family. On the night of the murder on 5 August 2009, Williams, 19 at the time, broke into Ms Michael's home and found her with another man. She called 999 at 02:29 BST and told the Gwent Police operator that Williams was at the house and had threatened to kill her. The call went through to Gwent Police but was passed to South Wales, the force covering the area of Ms Michael's address. Once transferred, the call should have been graded as requiring an immediate response, but was instead graded at a lower level. When officers had still not arrived, Ms Michael called 999 again at 02:43 BST and was heard screaming before the line went dead. Police arrived at 02:51 BST but in the 22 minutes it took them to respond to her first call, the mother of two had been stabbed 72 times. Her children were in the house at the time. Williams was jailed for life in March 2010, after admitting murder at Cardiff Crown Court.	The family of a woman who was murdered by her boyfriend after a 999 delay have been told they cannot sue two police forces for negligence.
The home secretary wrote to cabinet colleagues in December seeking approval to "reduce significantly" one type of stop and search, Newsnight has learned. Despite setting a 12 December deadline, the changes are yet to be announced. Downing Street said the prime minister accepted reforms needed to take place. However, officials have refused to say when any decisions might be taken. Critics say stop and search unfairly targets the black community. In November, the Equality and Human Rights Commission said that, overall, black people were six times more likely than white people to be stopped, with Asian or other ethnic minority groups two times more likely to be stopped. On 4 December, Home Secretary Theresa May wrote seeking approval from the cabinet's home affairs committee to a "package of measures". This included a plan to "amend section 60 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 so that the test for the power's use is 'necessary' and 'expedient', (to prevent incidents involving serious violence)". Under Section 60, police can stop and search someone for weapons in a designated area, for a specific time, without suspicion that the individual is involved in wrongdoing. However, a senior officer must hold a reasonable belief that violence has happened or may occur in the area. Mrs May told cabinet colleagues she intended to "raise the level of authorisation to a senior officer who must reasonably believe that violence 'will' take place (as opposed to 'may')". She continued: "I expect this to reduce significantly the number of stop and searches under section 60. Section 60 is only one kind of stop and search." One minister told Newsnight's chief correspondent Laura Kuenssberg that "we all want to get on" with the changes. But sources told her they feared "there's just a lack of will, a fear of looking soft on crime". The Liberal Democrats agree with the proposals and Labour has offered cross party talks to push the policy forward. Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said: "Instead of internal rows over this, Theresa May should accept our offer to work together to change stop and search." The prime minister's former adviser on youth and crime, Shaun Bailey, said: "Not getting stop and search right, certainly in urban communities, would be very dangerous because I believe it breeds criminals. "If I was talking to someone in government I'd say: 'Take the brave pill, you'll be rewarded for taking the brave pill and reforming stop and search'." He added: "There's many communities up and down the country who are divorced from politics and feel that the forces-that-be don't represent them and don't care about them. This would be a massive message in the right direction." While filming in Brixton, south London, Newsnight spoke to a teenager who said he had been stopped and searched as an 11 year-old. "Since then I've despised them [the police] more and more because for me they are like criminals in fancy dress," he said. "They've got such a big mob mentality." Another young man said he had been stopped and searched by the police "over 100 times" because he was "in a black neighbourhood" where the police "think everyone is a drug dealer". Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe agreed that random stop and search powers had created distrust between some communities and the police in London. He said over the last two years the Met had reduced the number of stop and searches by over a third, while doubling the number of arrests to one in five. "We employ human beings, they make mistakes and when we make a mistake - particularly with someone who's innocent of any crime, and frankly never will be guilty of any crime - we leave a really bad imprint on that child, on that family, so it's important we get it right. "But I think it's an important power, that used wisely, is really effective."	Plans to limit police stop and search powers in England and Wales have been held up by "regressive" attitudes in Downing Street, senior Conservatives have told BBC Newsnight.
The Times reports that doctors in Kiev used a method called pronuclear transfer in what is a world first. It is not the first baby born with DNA from three parents, however. The baby girl, born on 5 January, is thought to be the world's second "modern three-parent baby" - another child was created using a slightly different method in Mexico last year. The Kiev team fertilised the mother's egg with her partner's sperm. They then transferred the combined genes into an egg taken from a donor. The child has the genetic identity of the parents, alongside a tiny amount of DNA from the second woman. Doctors developed three-person IVF to help women who are at risk of passing on serious genetic disorders, called mitochondrial disease, to have a healthy child. Eggs from a mother with unhealthy mitochondria and a donor with healthy mitochondria are collected. The Nadiya clinic in Kiev used the technique to treat an infertile couple, not a couple carrying a mitochondrial disease. UK experts said this was "highly experimental". Valery Zukin, who led the work, said they had a hunch it would work for the Ukrainian couple who had not been able to conceive with conventional IVF. He said he had a second patient - in a similar situation - who is expected to give birth in early March. The UK has already passed laws to allow three-person IVF for couples with mitochondrial diseases, although no such baby has been born in Britain yet. The science is new and controversial and raises ethical questions, including how any child from the technique might feel about having DNA from three people. Prof Adam Balen, chairman of the British Fertility Society, said: "Pronuclear transfer is highly experimental and has not been properly evaluated or scientifically proven. "We would be extremely cautious about adopting this approach to improve IVF outcomes."	A baby has been born to a previously infertile couple in Ukraine using a new type of "three-person IVF".
Carbon is the key ingredient for all life on our planet. But how Earth acquired its "volatile elements" - which have low boiling points - such as carbon and sulphur remains a subject of some debate. A team now argues that a collision between Earth and an embryonic planet like Mercury could provide the answer. Details of the work appear in the journal Nature Geoscience. "The challenge is to explain the origin of the volatile elements like carbon that remain outside the core in the mantle portion of our planet," said Rajdeep Dasgupta, a co-author of the study from Rice University in Houston, Texas. According to a widely accepted idea called the Late Veneer Hypothesis, Earth formed from material that was largely devoid of volatiles. These elements, such as carbon, sulphur, nitrogen and hydrogen, were added later on by space rocks after Earth's core had finished forming. "Any of those elements that fell to Earth in meteorites and comets more than about 100 million years after the Solar System formed could have avoided the intense heat of the magma ocean that covered Earth up to that point," said Yuan Li, from the Guangzhou Institute of Geochemistry at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. "The problem with that idea is that while it can account for the abundance of many of these elements, there are no known meteorites that would produce the ratio of volatile elements in the silicate portion of our planet." The group had previously published papers showing that if even if carbon had not vaporised into space when the planet was largely molten, it would have ended up in the metallic core of our planet - because the iron-rich alloys there have a strong affinity for carbon. But if this is the case, where did the carbon in the mantle and biosphere come from? The team used laboratory experiments that can recreate the high-pressure and high-temperature conditions that exist deep inside Earth and other rocky planets. The found that one scenario that could reconcile the discrepancies in the carbon-to-sulphur ratio and carbon abundance was an embryonic planet like Mercury colliding with and being absorbed by Earth, early in its history. "Because it's a massive body, the dynamics could work in a way that the core of that planet would go directly to the core of our planet, and the carbon-rich mantle would mix with Earth's mantle," said Dr Dasgupta.	Much of Earth's life-giving carbon could have been delivered in a planetary collision about 4.4 billion years ago, a theory suggests.
Judge Angela Finnerty said the woman should not have brought the child to England until a family court in Japan had resolved a dispute she was having with the her estranged husband. The judge's decision has been revealed in a written ruling. It follows a hearing in the Family Division of the High Court in London. No-one involved was identified. The father had asked Judge Finnerty to order his son's return to Japan under the terms of international civil legislation relating to child abduction. Judge Finnerty said the man and woman - who had worked at different universities in Japan - split in 2013 after marrying nine years ago. They had reached an agreement about sharing care of their son after mediation in Japan. The woman had then been offered a post at Cambridge and said she wanted to take the child with her. The man objected. She had flown to the UK with the boy before a court in Tokyo had ruled on the dispute. "I am satisfied that (the boy) has been retained in the United Kingdom unlawfully in breach of the father's custody rights," said Judge Finnerty.	A Cambridge University academic has been ordered to return her seven-year-old son to his father in Japan, a family court has ruled.
Lt Cdr Malcolm Wanklyn spent part of his childhood at Knockinaam Lodge in Portpatrick. A commemorative blue plaque is being put on the property as part of a wider project by the Submariners Association. The latest one will honour the man who is considered to be "the most successful submarine commander of World War Two". Malcolm David Wanklyn was born on 28 June 1911 in India. His father William was a successful businessman and engineer who served in the army during the World War One and who had grown up in Ayrshire. At the end of the war the family moved to Knockinaam which was prompted by his father's new posting to Scotland as Inspector of Munitions. The family stayed there for five years in which time the young Malcolm became a keen and proficient angler and was fond of shooting and boating. The Submariners Association said he came to consider himself to be Scottish and developed "a close affinity for the country and people". Determined to join the Royal Navy, he overcame colour-blindness to pass the selection board at the age of 14. He rapidly rose through the ranks and eventually took command of the HMS Upholder in August 1940 while the submarine was being built. Once it was complete he sailed via Gibraltar to join the 10th Submarine Flotilla based in Malta. HMS Upholder was described as having a "short but very successful wartime career" which established Lt Cdr Wanklyn's "fearsome reputation". Things started slowly, with his first patrols being "largely unsuccessful", but they soon picked up. "Using a combination of innate skill and inspired tactical awareness, he went on to success after success," said the Submariners Association. "Not only was he a renowned attacker but was also cool and calm in defence." HMS Upholder survived numerous depth charges and of 36 attacks made under Lt Cdr Wanklyn's command, 23 were successful. The one described as the most daring was the sinking of the large liner-troopship Conte Rosso on 24 May 1941 which earned him the Victoria Cross. His citation, published in the London Gazette later that year, recognised his "valour and resolution in command of HMS Upholder". Despite failing light and -enemy Destroyers providing a strong escort, he attacked the troop convoy off the coast of Sicily. Not only did he sink the large troop ship, he was also praised for the "greatest courage, coolness and skill" in bringing his submarine safely back to harbour. "He has continued to show the utmost bravery in the presence of the enemy," the citation added. "He has carried out his attacks on enemy vessels with skill and relentless determination, and has also sunk one Destroyer, one U-boat, two troop-transports of 19,500 tons each, one tanker and three supply ships. "He has besides probably destroyed by torpedoes one Cruiser and one Destroyer, and possibly hit another Cruiser." However, the dangers of patrolling such waters eventually saw him pay the ultimate price. Lt Cdr Wanklyn was killed along with his crew when HMS Upholder was lost on patrol on 14 April 1942. By that time he had become the Allies' most successful submariner in terms of tonnage sunk. After his death, his squadron commander, Cdr George Simpson, said: "I have lost a friend and adviser who I believe I knew better than my brother. "His record of brilliant leadership will never be equalled. He was by his very qualities of modesty, ability, determination, courage and character a giant among us. "The island of Malta worshipped him. This tribute is no overstatement." He will be honoured again this weekend at the home where he grew up on the western edge of Dumfries and Galloway. A range of dignitaries and family members will be present at the unveiling of the plaque in his memory.	The exploits of a Victoria Cross recipient are being recognised at his former home in south west Scotland.
The draft Investigatory Powers Bill would place a legal duty on internet providers to assist in hacking devices. But it would not be restricted to phones and PCs, a tech industry chief told the Commons science and technology committee. Antony Walker, of techUK, said anything that connected to the internet could "in theory" be hacked into. In the future, this could include driverless cars or household appliances connected to the internet - the so-called Internet of Things - said Mr Walker. He said the Home Office needed to spell out more clearly where it draws the line over what it calls "equipment interference", highlighting recent concerns about "smart toys" that connect to the internet and have microphones and cameras built-in. "A range of devices that have been in the news recently, in relation to a hack, are children's toys, that children can interact with," he told the committee. "These are devices that may sit in a child's bedroom but are accessible. "In theory, the manufacturer of those products could be the subject of a warrant to enable equipment interference with those devices. "So the potential extent, I think, is something that needs to be carefully considered." In November, electronic toy company Vtech had its app store database hacked, allegedly resulting in the appearance online of personal data including children's names, dates of birth and gender. Talking dolls, such as Hello Barbie and My Friend Cayla, have also been put under scrutiny by security experts in recent months. Barbie manufacturer Mattel reportedly made modifications to Hello Barbie, which allows children to talk to the doll over a cloud server connection, after concerns were raised about cyber attackers potentially stealing data through it. The police, security services, HM Revenue and Customs and other law enforcement agencies can already hack into devices provided they get a warrant. This allows them to download the contents of computers or smartphones, track locations, listen to calls, or even switch on microphones and cameras, allowing officers to listen in to conversations or take pictures of those standing nearby. The Home Office says these powers, the existence of which were revealed earlier this year following a court case, have "made a vital contribution to counter the increased threat to the UK from Islamist terrorism and have also enabled the disruption of paedophile-related crime", according to a Home Office fact sheet. The draft Investigatory Powers Bill would put "equipment interference" warrants on a firmer legal footing and make sure they are "only used when necessary and proportionate for a legitimate purpose". A revised bill will be introduced to Parliament in the New Year, following consultation and scrutiny by the industry and other interested parties. Mr Walker, whose organisation represents 850 UK technology firms, told MPs it needed to be more forward-looking and less vague about the limits of surveillance. "When we start to think, not just about the world today, but the world in five, 10 years' time as the Internet of Things becomes more real, and more pervasive. "I think it requires careful thought in terms of where the limits should be."	The security services could remotely take over children's toys and use them to spy on suspects, MPs have been told.
"I have to work with Ikea - make furniture for interior design, for architecture," he told BBC Radio 1. He said students would be particularly keen for him to create "a minimalist apartment inside of a college dorm". "Yo Ikea, allow Kanye to create, allow him to make this thing because you know what, I want a bed that he makes, I want a chair that he makes." West was pictured visiting Ikea's head office in Almhult, south Sweden, earlier this year. He has previously collaborated with British fashion designer Katie Eary who has, in turn, created a series of textiles and tableware for Ikea. The company has so far declined to comment on a possible tie-in with West, who has a sideline designing clothes and shoes. Its ethos of providing affordable goods would chime with West's ambition to make his own products more affordable. The star's interview with Annie Mac also covered his headline set at the 2015 Glastonbury festival. He said a musical error at the beginning made him forget his lyrics, with knock-on effects for the rest of the set. "It was incredible. I started off the show and I completely messed up the music. And me, as you can imagine by this phone call, I'm a bit of a perfectionist. So it really put me into a slightly depressed state and it put me back in the position of when I was in high school and I got fired from my job. "I don't usually get nervous, I prepare, I get fully prepared. When that music messed up in the beginning it tapped into my nerves and when you're nervous or vulnerable something special and something different can happen." And he discussed his political ambitions, after previously declaring he would run for president in 2020. "When I talk about the idea of being president, I'm not saying I have any political views," said the 39-year-old. "I just have a view on humanity, on people, on the truth. "We are numb, we're numb to 500 kids getting killed in Chicago a year, we're numb to the fact that it was seven police shootings in the beginning of July. "If there is anything that I can do with my time and my day, to somehow make a difference while I'm alive I'm going to try to do it."

Rapper Kanye West has declared he wants to work with Ikea on a new range of furniture.
The group claim they are owed $40,000 (Â£23,500) by the Illinois-based outfit WorldWide Fan Clubs. The company had been charged with managing subscriptions and fan records for Duran Duran, with 75% of profits going to the musicians. Its owners declined to comment when contacted by the Associated Press. According to their legal action, filed in Cook County Circuit Court, Duran Duran also contend that the company - which operates out of the town of Glenview - failed to keep accurate accounts of fan club activity since they gained the contract for the work in 2010. It also stated they have made repeated requests for the unpaid fees to be settled. Part of their brief was to process subscriptions from fans, while their headquarters would also serve as a warehouse for the distribution of band merchandise. They were entitled to keep 25% of proceeds for their activities. Duran Duran were formed in Birmingham in 1978, with its core members Simon Le Bon, Nick Rhodes and John Taylor still in the line-up today. They have enjoyed a string of hits in both the UK and US, including Hungry Like The Wolf and Rio. In 2012, they performed at a concert to mark the opening ceremony of the London Olympics in Hyde Park. The band are currently at work on their 14th studio album.	Pop band Duran Duran have taken legal action against the US company charged with running their fan club over unpaid revenues, court papers have revealed.
For weeks he has come under pressure to step down as investigations continue into allegations that his wife was paid large sums of public money for a job she did not do. But having won a battle with his centre-right party, what now are Mr Fillon's chances in the fight for the Elysee Palace? He will have his work cut out if he is to claw back the lead he once held in France's presidential race. The latest opinion poll on Tuesday placed him third, on 19%, several points behind centrist Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen of the far-right National Front. Mr Fillon has stuck fast to his hard-core base for the past six weeks, as an investigation into his wife's employment whipped up a storm around his campaign. As centrist supporters deserted him in droves, he barely blinked. When his campaign manager and senior spokesman quit, Mr Fillon brushed it aside. When dozens of MPs deserted him, he retorted that he would do without them all. When polls suggested that he would struggle to reach the second round run-off, Mr Fillon ploughed on, determined to show that he retained the support of his most loyal followers. In that sense, his management of the scandal seems to have been a success. Tens of thousands of people turned out in the rain to rally around him on Sunday. But his handling of the allegations against him, and the media attention surrounding them, have also marked a sharp change in tone for France's most establishment presidential candidate, with new tactics borrowed from the populist playbook. Sunday's rally was initially described by Mr Fillon as a protest against political interference in the judiciary. He has complained of an "institutional coup d'etat", suggesting that the Socialist government is behind the allegations currently being investigated. At press conferences recently he has presented himself as the victim a "political assassination", of a "lynching" by the media, and he has accused investigators of leaking only one side of the evidence in his case. Mr Fillon has said he will leave it up to the voters to judge him, not a "biased [judicial] process". But attacking the nation's institutions while running for office has not gone down well with some party colleagues. Former Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin, on French radio, called it "dangerous" and "irresponsible". The man Mr Fillon beat to become Republican candidate, Alain Juppe, accused him of leading the campaign into an impasse. "He had a wide open road before him," he said. "What a waste." There was a sceptical response, too, to the claim by Mr Fillon's team that Sunday's rally had drawn 200,000 people to the Trocadero in Paris. Several journalists remarked that the plaza only held around 35,000 people when full. The claim of 200,000 is still prominently featured on Mr Fillon's campaign website. There is now talk of a "Trumpisation" of the centre-right candidate, with several commentators and news outlets comparing him to the US president. It is a very different side of a politician many saw as calm, unruffled and rather phlegmatic; "impervious to demagoguery and exaggeration", as Le Monde put it. But will the same tactics work to win back the broader votes he needs in the election itself? Mr Fillon might claim legitimacy from the people, but he is still a risk for his party. He is due to appear before a judge on 15 March and says he expects to be placed under formal investigation. Attacking the media, government and judiciary might work with his most loyal supporters, but it has driven many other voters away. If this is the new face of Francois Fillon, some might wonder what that says about the future of French politics itself.	French presidential candidate Francois Fillon has avoided an abrupt end to his campaign by securing the support of his divided Republican Party.
Royal Mail said the rise of delivery firm Whistl could wipe £200m off sales. It also said competition was endangering its government-mandated Universal Service, which guarantees a single price postal service that delivers to all UK addresses. The caution came as Royal Mail reported a small fall in pre-tax profits. They dropped to £218m for the six months to 28 September, from £233m in the same period last year. In its financial statement, Royal Mail named Whistl, formerly known as TNT, as a direct threat to future profits. The company also said it faced increased parcel competition and that Amazon's recently-launched delivery service could singlehandedly dent its business by as much as 2%, in the short term. In the past six months, Royal Mail's UK parcel delivery division saw revenues fall by 1%. However the firm's international parcel delivery service, GLS, fared well, with revenue up 7%, helping the company's overall revenue to rise by just £5m to slightly above £4.52bn. Royal Mail's letter business saw volumes drop by 3%, although this was not as steep a fall as had been expected. The slower decline was due to election pamphleteering, particularly relating to the Scottish Referendum, for which Royal Mail delivered seven million campaign mailings and over five million poll cards. Royal Mail boss Moya Greene told the BBC that increased competition was threatening the company's ability to deliver letters to all parts of the UK - a service mandated by law. She added that the "cherry-picking" of urban mail routes by competitors "undermines the economics" of its nationwide delivery service. Royal Mail has long called for the regulator, Ofcom, to consider expanding the Universal Service mandate - which ensures mail is delivered across the UK, six days a week, at one fixed price - so that it includes rivals such as Whistl. That may include forcing competitors to also deliver letters to rural areas at an affordable price - a service for which companies can make little or no profit. "We believe the current regulatory framework does not fully address the problem posed by unfettered direct delivery competition," Royal Mail said. "We think there is an urgent need for a new framework that will secure the sustainable provision of the Universal Service for the future." In response, a spokesman for Ofcom said the regulator's own evidence "clearly shows that the service is not currently under threat". "We would assess any emerging threat to the service quickly, in the interests of postal users," he added. Royal Mail has been under increased public scrutiny since it was privatised in October 2013. In July, a group of MPs voiced concerns that the taxpayer may have lost out by about £1bn after Royal Mail shares were "undervalued". After an initial pricing of 330p, Royal Mail shares rose above 600p in the months after its flotation, but have been steadily declining since the early summer, to 430p. Analysis: Kamal Ahmed, BBC Business Editor Lurking on page 8 of today's numbers is the real story in Royal Mail's results - that the business is warning of a "material risk" to the Universal Service obligation. Some may dismiss this as special pleading from a company that does not much like competition. But I have just spoken to the Royal Mail's chief executive, Moya Greene, and she is clear - if action isn't taken now, Royal Mail's ability to fund the six day letter delivery service across the UK will come under possibly unmanageable strain. "The threat is now," she told me.	Shares in Royal Mail closed down 8.3% after the firm warned that rivals - including Amazon - were eating into its parcel delivery business.
The stricken robot, made by Knightscope, was spotted by passers-by whose photos of the aftermath quickly went viral on social media. For some, the incident seemed to sum up the state of 21st Century technology. "We were promised flying cars, instead we got suicidal robots," wrote one worker from the building on Twitter. "Steps are our best defence against the Robopocalypse," commented Peter Singer - author of Wired for War, a book about military robotics. It is not the first accident involving Knightscope's patrolling robots, which are equipped with various instruments - including face-recognition systems, high-definition video capture, infrared and ultrasonic sensors. Last year, a 16-month-old toddler was run over by one of the autonomous devices in a Silicon Valley shopping centre. And earlier this year, a Californian man was arrested after attacking a Knightscope robot. The man, who was drunk at the time of the incident, later said he wanted to "test" the machine, according to Knightscope.	A security robot in Washington DC suffered a watery demise after falling into a fountain by an office building.
Monday's bond sale was Apple's third such sale in as many years and was just over half the $12bn the company raised in April 2014. The California-based firm plans to return more than $130bn to shareholders by the end of this year. The move comes despite the company sitting on a cash pile of $178bn. Some of the bonds are set to mature in five years, while others will not do so for another three decades. Analysts have said that Apple could increase the amount it returns to its investors to as much as $200bn over the next three years. Even when Apple's $35bn of debt is taken into account, it still has $142bn in cash. Almost 90% of the cash is held outside the US, and it would have to pay the top corporate tax rate of 35% if it returned the money from abroad, which is why it is borrowing the money instead. Apple is rated by Moody's as Aa1, the second-highest available, and bonds from companies with high credit ratings are popular with investors. Deutsche Bank and Goldman Sachs are the banks managing the capital-raising. Last week, Apple reported a record quarterly profit for a public company of $18bn for the three months to 31 December, with revenue up almost 30% to $74.6bn after the new iPhone 6 proved a huge hit with consumers globally. Shares in Apple closed up 1.25%  to $118.63 in New York on Monday, valuing the company at about $684bn.	US technology giant Apple raised a better than expected $6.5bn (£4.3bn) through a corporate bond sale, as part of a plan to return cash to investors.
The pledges are included in the party's five-year plan for government. Increased free child care and more apprenticeships are promised, along with an M4 relief road and a South Wales Metro public transport network. Plaid Cymru said the programme was "lacklustre", while the Conservatives said Labour had let Wales down. The most expensive commitments cover 30 hours of free childcare a week over 48 weeks for parents of three and four-year-olds, and 100,000 apprenticeships open to people of all ages. The programme covers what the Welsh Government will try to achieve, while the first indication of what will be cut will emerge when its draft budget is published in October. The main pledges include: A Welsh Government source said there had been a "full and frank assessment of every pound, shilling and pence that we spend" in light of the financial uncertainty surrounding Brexit. He added: "Some tough decisions will have to be made in the first year. "Salami slicing is not going to get the job done this time round. There will be areas and programmes that will be cut." Responding to the claims on BBC Radio Wales, the first minister said: "There are going to be cuts... I'm not going to pretend otherwise. "Of course, our budget is shrinking, it has been for many years and that means very difficult decisions have to be taken. "We are going to have to look at some of the schemes we have delivered for many, many years and make a judgement." A programme, called Taking Wales Forward, reflects many of the pledges outlined in Labour's manifesto for the Welsh Assembly election in May. Mr Jones said Labour would see through its election promises, including building an M4 relief road and a South Wales Metro. He said: "The UK's withdrawal from the European Union creates some uncertainty and challenges, but our mandate is clear. "The Welsh Government's relentless focus will be on driving improvement in our economy and public services, which are together the bedrock of people's daily lives. On local government reform, Mr Jones said many services would have to be delivered "on a wider basis" in future, but he would not say whether this meant council mergers were still on the cards. Plaid Cymru AM Rhun ap Iorwerth said the programme for government portrayed the "gulf" between the two parties. That was despite pledges that were part of a deal struck in return for allowing Carwyn Jones to be re-elected as first minister back in May. "It should come as no surprise that a lacklustre manifesto has led to a lacklustre programme for government," said Mr ap Iorwerth. "Yes, it's good to see the elements that Plaid Cymru drove through in our post-election one-off agreement, including a pledge to create 100,000 new apprenticeships and a new drugs and treatments fund, but Labour's lack of innovative ideas shines through again." As the official opposition in the assembly, Plaid said it would be "challenging Labour to do better". The Conservatives said it was "difficult to disagree" with the plans but said Labour had "let Wales down" since devolution. Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies said: "As usual we are left with little by way of detail, and Carwyn Jones's claim that Wales is punching above its weight is delusional. "In spite of our many and varied talents, the evidence suggests that the exact opposite is true. "Under Labour, the Welsh education system ranks behind Vietnam; large swathes of Wales are poorer than parts of Bulgaria, Romania and Poland; and Welsh NHS waiting times are the longest in the UK. "If the Labour Party thinks that Wales punching above its weight, then they have a very low opinion of our country indeed." Janet Jones, Wales policy chair for the Federation of Small Businesses, said: "We welcome the commitment in the Programme for Government to supporting innovation and providing additional support for businesses. "Key to that commitment must be a new economic development strategy which meets the challenges facing the Welsh economy in the coming five years. "That strategy needs to contain fresh thinking and should place a focus on growing small firms into the successful and grounded medium-sized businesses that Wales needs to put our economy on a stronger footing." Brexit will cast uncertainty over the next five years, says Carwyn Jones. But as someone who campaigned for a Remain vote, he is bound to talk up the risks - as he sees them - of leaving the EU. Whatever comes from Brexit, we know for certain there are plenty of hurdles that will make life difficult for Mr Jones if he is to deliver this five-year programme. Labour has no majority in the Senedd. Today's statement is a chance for him to explain how he will make Labour's manifesto a reality. But in doing so, he must keep other parties on side to maintain his grip on power. And we know there will be growing pressure on the Welsh Government budget. More cuts loom and sources close to the first minister say they have already had to wield the axe to raise the funds necessary to pay for expensive manifesto pledges.	Labour will keep its election promises despite uncertainty over Brexit, but cuts to some services are inevitable, the first minister has warned.
The 4.4-metre-long (14-ft) cloth is on show until 24 June. Viewings are free but must be booked. One million people have already signed up. Some devotees believe the shroud is the burial cloth of Jesus Christ. Sceptics point to carbon dating that suggests it is a medieval forgery from the 1300s. Scientists have not agreed on how the image of a man was imprinted on the cloth. Turin Shroud: See it in detail Pope Francis will be among those to view the shroud, during a visit to the northern Italian city on 21 June. The last public viewings were in 2010, when 2.5 million people came to see it. The Church has not officially claimed that Christ's body was wrapped in the shroud, preferring instead to focus on what it means to those who see it. "Whether you believe or don't believe, there is no doubt it is something special," an Italian man who was among the first visitors on Sunday told the AFP news agency. Earlier this week, Archbishop of Turin Cesare Nosiglia said: "What counts the most is that this shroud... reflects in a clear and precise manner how the gospels describe the passion and death of Jesus. "It is not a profession of faith because it is not an object of faith, nor of devotion, but it can help faith." Archbishop Nosiglia said that many of those coming to see the shroud would be returnees. "That means there is a fundamental need in people's hearts to renew this incredible experience that they had the first time they saw it," he said. "Even non-believers will come. It's an occasion that brings everybody together." The shroud is displayed in a climate-controlled case for 12 hours a day in Turin's Cathedral of St John the Baptist.	The Turin Shroud has gone back on public display in the Italian city's cathedral, after a break of five years.

The grant will see six hectares of Broadcroft Quarry in Portland, Dorset, restored and opened as a trail. The two-year project is one of the first steps towards the main Jurassica attraction, which is planned in the 40m (132ft) deep quarry. The work will see a team of more than 100 volunteers work with conservation experts at the Dorset Wildlife Trust. Funding for the attraction is being raised through donations, grants and sponsorship from businesses. The proposed subterranean park on the World Heritage Site would see a glass and steel roof, about a third the size of the Millennium Dome, installed over the quarry. It would house an aquarium with robot swimming plesiosaurs, fossils and interactive displays. The charity behind the museum, which will cover three geological time periods, said it planned to submit a full planning application later this year. Sir David Attenborough is the project's patron and the Eden Project's Sir Tim Smit is its trustee. It also has the backing of the Royal Society and the Natural History Museum. Jurassica is the idea of science writer Michael Hanlon who died last year aged 51 after a heart attack.	Plans for an Â£80m dinosaur-themed museum in a quarry have been boosted by Â£37,300 of Heritage Lottery Funding.
As reported in the Daventry Express, Sam Chambers, coach of Weedon Bec Primary School, sent his CV to the FA after England crashed out of Euro 2016. "I feel like the perfect candidate as I have guided my school... to an unbeaten 2015-16 season," he wrote. Ladbrokes has made him a 1,000/1 outsider for the job. Roy Hodgson stood down as England manager after the shock 2-1 defeat to Iceland last week. Jessica Bridge from the bookmaker said: "Stranger things have happened in the last 12 months, like Leicester City winning the Premier League, so it's not out of the realms of possibility. "Sam enters the record books as one of the greatest sporting underdogs of all time." Mr Chambers, who describes himself as a "sports enthusiast", faces stiff competition from current favourites Jurgen Klinsmann and Sam Allardyce, but says he has the passion to be a success in the job. "I, along with millions across the nation, saw our beloved team fall to the minnows that are Iceland," he wrote in his covering letter to the FA. "It is my intention, should I be given the opportunity, to re-kindle the enthusiasm of the nation for the round-ball game." Elaborating on his school's impressive season, Mr Chambers added he had guided his side to an unbeaten campaign - even though they faced "mighty teams such as Woodford Halse CE Primary Academy". He ends the letter with an optimistic "I look forward to hearing from you all!" The FA is yet to comment on Mr Chambers' application. Earlier this year, a seven-year-old boy failed in his quest to become Inverness Caledonian Thistle's new manager, despite a pledge that his headmaster would probably let him leave school early "for important matches and training".	The coach of a primary school football team has applied for the England job, saying he is the "perfect candidate" to succeed Roy Hodgson.
The killer, a 42-year-old man who had worked at the factory for 10 years, is among the dead. Shooting broke out in the canteen at the Kronospan wood processing plant in the town of Menznau at around 09:00 (08:00 GMT). A prosecution spokesperson said the shooting took place over a few minutes. Five of the injured are reported to be in a serious condition, the Associated Press reports. "The workers were eating a snack in the cafeteria during the morning, and there was a massacre," said a man quoted by the Swiss news website 20minutes, who had phoned the factory to check on the welfare of his father. An emergency telephone line was set up for families of the factory's employees. "There were three dead and seven injured, some of them seriously injured," prosecutors' spokesman Simon Kopp told Swiss newspaper Blick. The chief executive of Kronospan, Mauro Capozzo, denied rumours that job cuts were due to be announced. He described the man who opened fire as quiet and unassuming. "One almost didn't see or notice him," he said, according to Reuters. Switzerland has one of the highest rates of gun ownership in the world, with an estimated 2.3 million firearms owned by the country's eight million people, but such gun attacks are relatively rare. All healthy Swiss men aged between 18 and 34 are obliged to do military service and all are issued with assault rifles or pistols which they are supposed to keep at home. Until recently, many kept their weapons even after completing their military service - though rules on this have recently been tightened. According to the Geneva-based Small Arms Survey, Switzerland ranks third in terms of gun ownership, behind the United States and Yemen. Street gun violence is very rare in Switzerland, says Emma Jane Kirby, who recently investigated the subject for BBC News. However, there are more domestic homicides and suicides with a firearm in Switzerland than virtually anywhere else in Europe except Finland, she says.	Three people have been killed and seven injured during a shooting at a factory near the Swiss city of Lucerne, police have said.
The International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) said some people were killed simply because they did not have identity documents. A Malian army officer was quoted as denying the allegations. Meanwhile, the UN says 7,100 civilians have fled to neighbouring states since 10 January to escape fighting. Reports suggesting that the mainly black African Malian army, drawn largely from the south, has targeted Arabs and ethnic Tuaregs from the north expose a racial aspect to the war here which has been hidden by the emphasis on western troops fighting a war against Islamist insurgents, the BBC's Mark Doyle in Mali says. France intervened militarily on 11 January to halt a militant advance. It said al-Qaeda linked Islamists - some of whom were foreigners - threatened to turn Mali into a "terrorist state". It has bombed suspected rebel positions and deployed about 2,000 troops to help the weak Malian army recapture territory. FIDH said there needed to be an independent investigation into alleged abuses committed by Malian soldiers and those responsible should be punished. In the garrison town of Sevare, at least seven people were executed at a military camp, near a bus station and a hospital, it said. There was "credible information" pointing to 20 other executions in Sevare, with bodies "buried hastily, notably in wells", FIDH said. Summary killings also took place in the towns of Mopti and Niono, the group added. "Other allegations of summary executions continue to come from all areas of the west and centre of the country," it said. It added that some of the victims were accused of possessing weapons, and of being "infiltrators" and "accomplices" of the militants. Others were killed because they did not have identity documents or simply because of their ethnicity, FIDH said. Dozens of ethnic Tuaregs in Mali's capital, Bamako, have also had their homes raided by troops, the group added. Voices from Diabaly after rebel battle The Malian army's Capt Modibo Traore said the allegations were "completely false" but declined to comment further, AP news agency reports. United Nations refugee agency (UNHCR) regional coordinator Valentin Tapsoba said 7,100 people had fled to neighbouring countries in the last two weeks to escape fighting. Most of them - some 4,000 - had fled to Mauritania, Mali's western neighbour, Mr Tapsoba told the BBC's Focus on Africa programme. He said a further 3,100 people had crossed into Burkina Faso and Chad, to the east of Mali. Nearly 10,000 have also also moved into camps inside Mali since 10 January, he said. The latest conflict erupted after the militants advanced southwards, attacking the central towns of Konna, Diabaly and Douentza. French officials say their forces have helped Malian troops to recapture all three towns. France hopes to hand command of the operation to a West African force, which currently has some 1,000 soldiers on the ground.	Mali's army has carried out a "series of summary executions" as it fights to recapture the Islamist-controlled north, a rights group has said.
Hirst rose from humble beginnings in Leeds to become the UK's richest living artist, worth Â£215m according to the Sunday Times' Rich List. Penguin Books has promised to push the book in the same "radical" manner as Morrissey's autobiography, which was published under its classic imprint. The artist has selected journalist James Fox as his ghostwriter. Fox was the writer behind Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards' autobiography, as well as the book White Mischief, which recounted the Happy Valley murder case in Kenya in 1941. Hirst was one of the founding members of the Young British Artists (YBA) movement, which also counted Tracey Emin, Sarah Lucas and Mark Wallinger amongst its numbers. Many of them were students at Goldsmiths College in London in the late 1980s. Their first major exhibition, in a warehouse, attracted a number of influential art collectors, including Charles Saatchi - who would later become one of his Hirst's greatest supporters. Hirst's work - which includes spot paintings and a sheep and shark preserved in formaldehyde - has frequently had the ability to shock. A two-day auction of his work in 2008 raised a record-breaking Â£111m. Speaking on the Today programme, Fox said: "He (Hirst) grew up in a pretty bad situation, with his mother, and he and his gang - many of whom became YBA artists, spent half their time housebreaking, stealing, [indulging in] criminality, and the rest of their time indulging their passion for art, which started very early on in their years. "I found that completely fascinating, moving, the idea of a saving connection to art. The fearlessness of Damien, his ability to take on authority, to never say anything can't be done, to break all the rules. That very much comes from that background."	Damien Hirst is to publish his autobiography, promising to lay bare the British modern art world.
The 64-year-old was found with critical injuries in Luxfield Road, south-east London, at about 02:10 GMT. He was pronounced dead at the scene. A 52-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder close to where the victim was found. The arrested man and the victim knew each other but were not related, the Metropolitan Police said. The victim's next of kin have been informed.	A man has been stabbed to death in Mottingham in the early hours of Boxing Day.
Archibald was responding to comments by his former player Ziggy Gordon that he has learned more in a few months in Poland than in his years in Scotland. "I don't think he's trying to downgrade the standard here," said the Jags boss. "I just think he has learned a little bit more abroad." Jose Mourinho, Costinha, Andre Villas-Boas, Brendan Rodgers, Pedro Caixinha and Alan Shearer are among those who have come to Scotland to sit their Uefa Pro licence over the years. Archibald, who is on the four-man shortlist for the PFA Scotland manager of the year award, said he had never seen Polish coaches at work so did not know how accurate the Jagiellonia Bialystok defender's comments were. "I've never been there, so I don't know where he's coming from," said the Jags boss. "But I think when any player goes abroad, you'll pick something up. Your eyes are opened wide, and you'll learn something a little bit different." Further, Archibald said the standard of coaching in Scotland was "very good". He continued: "I think a lot of top coaches come here to do their coaching badges so we must be doing something right. "As (Celtic manager) Brendan Rodgers says, you get a challenge every week. This has probably been the best season in terms of the challenge, tactically. "All the managers are now playing different shapes and changing it during games as well, so I think all coaches are tactically very aware and they all do their homework now as well. "I don't think any team just turns up on a Saturday and says 'right, on you go, go and play'. There's a lot of work going in during the week from every team in the league." Archibald admitted to being taken aback to be nominated by his peers as Scotland's top manager this season, along with Rodgers, Aberdeen's Derek McInnes and Morton's Jim Duffy. "I think (I'm surprised) just because we've not won anything," said the manager, whose team reached the Premiership's top six for the first time. "Brendan's won trophies, Derek's been to semi-finals and finals and so has Jim. "We are sixth and sometimes from the outside people don't know how hard you work, or what it takes to get there. "Making the top six is huge to a club like ours, and sometimes it's as good as winning a trophy."	Partick Thistle manager Alan Archibald points to the procession of coaches coming to Scotland to attain their Uefa licence as proof that the standard of coaching in Scotland is high.
The Sorrento was travelling to the coastal city of Valencia when the blaze began and quickly got out of control. The passengers were evacuated from the burning ship on to lifeboats and have been rescued by another ship. At least three people have been injured and have been taken to hospital by helicopter, Spanish media say. One is reported to be seriously hurt. The ship was about 27km (17 miles) from Mallorca when the fire broke out on Tuesday afternoon on one of the car decks. The reason for the fire was unclear. Several ships including two passenger ferries were sent to help. The passengers and crew on the life rafts eventually boarded one of the ferries, the Puglia. Spanish officials said the rescued passengers were on their way back to Palma de Mallorca and were expected to arrive at the port in a few hours' time. Psychologists were being asked to go to the port to provide counselling. "Due to the fire that it has suffered, The Sorrento may sink in the position in which it finds itself," the Balearic Islands port authority said in a tweet (in Spanish). The ferry, owned by Italian company Atlantica di Navigazione, sent out distress signals at 13:50 local time (11:50 GMT), said Spain's Ministry of Public Works. At first, the ministry said the captain did not believe it would be necessary to abandon the ship but the fire became so intense that a full evacuation was called for.	A fire has broken out on a Spanish ferry from Mallorca, forcing some 150 passengers and crew to abandon ship.
The research firm warns he could disrupt the global economy and heighten political and security risks in the US. However, it does not expect Mr Trump to defeat Hillary Clinton who it sees as "his most likely Democratic contender". He is rated as riskier than Britain leaving the European Union or an armed clash in the South China Sea. China encountering a "hard landing" or sharp economic slowdown and Russia's interventions in Ukraine and Syria preceding a new "cold war" are among the events seen as more dangerous. "Thus far Mr Trump has given very few details of his policies - and these tend to be prone to constant revision," the EIU said in its global risk assessment, which looks at impact and probability. The EIU ranking uses a scale of one to 25, with Mr Trump garnering a rating of 12, the same level of risk as "the rising threat of jihadi terrorism destabilising the global economy". "He has been exceptionally hostile towards free trade, including notably Nafta, and has repeatedly labelled China as a 'currency manipulator'," the EIU said. It warned his strong language directed towards Mexico and China in particular "could escalate rapidly into a trade war". Mr Trump has called for a "big big wall" to be built on the US-Mexican border, paid for by Mexico, to keep illegal immigrants and drug dealers out of the United States. Why is Donald Trump considered only slightly less of a threat to global security than a new Cold War? Perhaps it is because unlike traditional presidential front-runners the candidate has little or no policy substance to back up his shoot-from-the-hip-style pronouncements. Want details on how the New Yorker would restructure US trade relations with China? Or how he would implement his proposed Muslim immigration ban? Good luck finding out. Mr Trump has been promising to reveal his foreign policy team since mid-February, but the deadline keeps getting extended. A well-developed foreign policy campaign structure would provide not only substance behind Mr Trump's rhetoric, it would also give foreign leaders connections for their questions. So far, however, it seems international affairs and national security experts in the US are more focused on stopping Mr Trump than trying to help him. Until that changes, expect the global alarm bells to continue to sound. On the campaign trail, Mr Trump has advocated killing the families of terrorists and invading Syria to eradicate the so-called Islamic State group and appropriate its oil. "His militaristic tendencies towards the Middle East and ban on all Muslim travel to the US would be a potent recruitment tool for jihadi groups, increasing their threat both within the region and beyond," the EIU added. Critics of Mr Trump have raised similar concerns. However, the businessman is moving closer to clinching the Republican presidential nominee ticket after winning most of the popular vote in primary elections. Mr Trump, who has no prior political experience, has said his supporters would "riot" if he was denied the nomination. In the event he does win the nomination and presidency, the EIU forecasts that domestic and foreign policymaking will be undermined. "Innate hostility within the Republican hierarchy towards Mr Trump, combined with the inevitable virulent Democratic opposition, will see many of his more radical policies blocked in Congress," it said.	Donald Trump winning the US presidency is considered one of the top 10 risks facing the world, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit.
We received that question from Drew who is planning a trip to New York in December. He asked: "Should I get my cash now or should I wait? Will there be much change between now and then?" Anthony Reuben, from BBC Reality Check, had this answer: "The BBC does not give financial advice, but here are a few things to bear in mind... "The exchange rate between the pound and the dollar reflects the views of investors about the relative strengths of the two economies. "Since the Brexit vote in June the pound has fallen about 18% against the dollar on the judgment that growth is likely to be stronger in the US than the UK and that UK interest rates are falling while the next movement in US rates is expected to be upwards. "But it's always possible that something could happen to change that view - there is a presidential election in the US in November, for example. The outcome of that could make a considerable difference to the exchange rate. "You do not necessarily have to put all your eggs in one basket - there is also the option to hedge your bets and buy half of your dollars now and half of them just before you go, as long as you are not going to be hit by extra charges for carrying out two transactions. "It is always worth shopping around when buying currency - avoid buying your currency at the last minute at the airport. There are plenty of comparison sites online that will help you get the most dollars possible for your pounds, even if it is fewer than you would have got a few months ago." We asked readers to send in questions about the recent fall of the pound and rise of the FTSE 100. Anthony chose Drew's question: "I'm planning on going to New York in December, should I get my cash now or wait? Will there be much change between now and then?" Take a look at some of the other questions you've wanted us to answer: Why does the NHS spend on homeopathy? Could the UK take over existing EU trade deals? Does fracking affect the water supply? If you are reading this page on the BBC News app, you will need to visit the mobile version of the BBC website to submit your question.	With the value of the pound falling dramatically since Brexit, a "flash crash" last week when the currency lost 6% of its value against the dollar, and news on Tuesday that the pound had fallen again, when would be a good time to change those pounds to dollars?
Tom Dryden, from Earls Barton in Northamptonshire, described the news as "absolutely outstanding". Lorna Clarke, from Oxford, took the the women's title. It's the second time she has entered the games. Organisers said 190 competitors from countries including Russia, the USA and Japan took part in the event in Southwick, Northamptonshire. Read more about England's events on Pinterest Since it began in 1965, the event has raised about Â£400,000 for blind and visually impaired charities. Ms Clarke, a digital marketing manager said: "Its amazing.  The trick was skill, accuracy and a little bit of luck.  My colleagues will laugh but will be very impressed." Mr Dryden, who is a Cub Scout assistant, said: "I never thought I'd win the first time I entered.  The cubs will be over the moon." A new conker is used for every round. StJohn Burkett said preparations had been tough this year because of a shortage of decent conkers. He said: "We collect a couple of thousand and we have to get the proper Championship-sized conkers. They're quite rare. "We usually rely on two secret trees but even they haven't produced this year so we've had the whole committee out collecting."	A new king has been crowned World Conker Champion after taking part in the annual games for the first time.
The portal, for the match against Poland, will be open to supporters on a priority list who were were informed they had missed out on Tuesday. UEFA is to make about 1,000 extra tickets available to Northern Ireland fans. Northern Ireland are  to play Poland, Ukraine and Germany in France in June. On Tuesday, the IFA said it was "inundated" with calls from angry Northern Ireland fans unable to purchase tickets. Some fans who said they ranked near the top of the IFA's 'priority list' missed out on tickets for the Poland game. Particularly affected were fans who applied for category 3 tickets, the second cheapest kind. "We discovered there was an issue yesterday morning on this with quite a number of people finding they hadn't got tickets in category 3 for the Poland game," IFA chief executive Patrick Nelson said. "We got straight onto Uefa and with Uefa's senior management team, we've worked through that issue now. We've identified with Uefa that there's almost another 1,000 tickets that they're going to make available for us, particularly for those fans. "The 900 or so fans that we're talking about here will have priority access, in fact specific access, to a portal that Uefa are setting up and they should be able to buy tickets. "We've been talking to Uefa for not quite the last 24 hours, but probably 21 of the last 24 hours over this and we're fairly confident that Uefa will manage this in the right way." A points system had been put in place for the games to establish a priority list for tickets, favouring fans who had attended the most matches at home and abroad. However, on Tuesday Gary McAllister from the Amalgamation of Official NI Supporters Clubs said many fans were now asking whether the loyalty scheme has been implemented correctly. He missed out on a ticket to the Poland game, despite having 27 loyalty points out of a possible 29. In the Republic of Ireland, fans have not yet heard if they have been successful in securing tickets. Irish Times chief football writer Emmet Malone said the experience of Northern Ireland supporters has worried fans in the Republic of Ireland. Speaking to BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme on Wednesday, Mr Malone said there was "a lot of pessimism" among Ireland fans. "The FAI [Football Association of Ireland] is supposed to start informing people, possibly as early as this afternoon, as to who got tickets here," he said. "But our applications were far more oversubscribed than the IFA's, so a lot of people are very concerned about what will happen." Mr Malone said there was particular concern that the FAI's loyalty scheme was only introduced in 2015, so is it relatively new. "The FAI have  been quite vague with fan groups over requests to publish the points that everybody has, how the categories break down, who's going to be compared with who in terms of pecking order. "That vagueness is going to lead to an awful lot of bad feeling here over the next few days."	The Irish Football Association has said Uefa will set up a portal for Northern Ireland supporters to apply for extra European Championship tickets.
The ancient berry is from the same family of plants as potatoes, tomatoes and peppers. On the fossil, you can see the lines of the papery wrapping that grew around the fruit, which turned into coal during fossilisation. It was found in the Patagonia area of Argentina and researchers are hoping to find lots more plant fossils there. That's not the only place where old food can been found. We'd recommend you didn't eat these examples, which are all definitely way past their sell-by date! This huge 2,000-year-old lump of butter was found in a bog near Drakerath in Ireland last year. It probably wouldn't fit inside your fridge - it weighs as much as 10 large bags of sugar. Conditions in bogs are good for preserving things so the butter is in a good state, even though it's so old. It does, however, smell like strong cheese. We're not sure which would smell worse, this butter, or... Last year, divers were exploring a shipwreck buried deep under the sea near Sweden when they found this jar. They didn't know there was cheese inside until the journey to the surface caused some of the contents to leak, releasing a very strong smell. The stinky discovery was made when the team were investigating the wreck of the Kronan, a warship that sank 340 years ago. Now that's taking mature cheddar to the extreme! In 2015, an American couple revealed they were still eating their wedding cake, 60 years after it was first baked in 1955. Ann and Ken Fredericks, from Florida, decided to eat one piece of the fruit cake every year to celebrate the day they got married. They said their children were horrified at them eating such old food but insist that it still tastes as good as ever! We're wondering how long it'll take them to finish the whole cake...	A 52 million-year-old fruit fossil has been discovered in South America.
Lukasz Robert Pawlowski, 33, stabbed himself before Haverfordwest magistrates on 11 January. On Monday, his case at Swansea Crown Court was adjourned for sentence until 6 March. He was remanded in custody. Pawlowski, from Pembroke Dock, admitted possessing a knife and confirmed his earlier guilty plea to sexual assault. Stuart John, defending, told the court Pawlowski, who spent six weeks in custody after his re-arrest at Swansea's Morriston Hospital, had not yet been assessed by psychiatrists. Judge Paul Thomas said a report on the defendant was needed to assess his actions but "unfortunately" one could not be prepared for two weeks. During the incident last month, witnesses were shocked when Pawlowski started making "frantic jabs" at his neck after returning to the dock from going to the toilet. Paramedics were called and he was airlifted to hospital with what the ambulance service described as "serious" injuries. Pawlowski appeared via video link for Monday's court hearing. Judge Thomas said: "I don't want you to spend any more time in custody than you have to. But I can't make any promises."	A man who slit his own throat while in a dock awaiting sentence has admitted taking a kitchen knife into a magistrates' court in Pembrokeshire.
Sarries' Australian lock Skelton slapped the GB Olympic Sevens Rio silver medallist in the face late in the 22-22 European Champions Cup draw. BBC pundit Brian Moore was among those to accuse Davies, 26, of over-reacting. "It's not good is it? If one of our players did that I'd be devastated," said McCall. "But I don't think they would. It's terrible, but you don't need me to tell you that." Moore wrote: "Scarlets should have won but, had they done so, it would have been spoiled by another example of simulation (cheating by exaggeration) from Davies." Scarlets head coach Pivac defended Davies' behaviour - and questioned how clean former England hooker Moore was as a player. "I've spoken to our medical staff, and they tell me he [Davies] is getting acupuncture on his neck," Pivac said. "The facts speak for themselves: 140kg, swinging arm, hit him on the chin. We've confirmed that. "Unless you've been hit by 140kg or been struck on the jaw, you really should keep your comments to yourself. "James tells me it [falling over] was more shock from being struck. He fell to the ground and he got straight back up. "If I was the Saracens coach I'd be sanctioning my player for throwing a punch which is against the rules of the game." Asked about Moore's criticism, Pivac added: "I don't condone taking a dive, that's why I don't watch football. "Brian Moore? Well, he was squeaky clean as a player wasn't he?"	Saracens boss Mark McCall has criticised Scarlets' James Davies after Will Skelton was sin-binned during the meeting of the side last weekend.
McCourt, who previously owned the Los Angeles Dodgers, told L'Equipe he planned to invest 200m euros (£180m) in the club over the next four years. Nine-time Ligue 1 winners Marseille, who finished 13th last season, are 12th in the table after nine games. "Today a new chapter opens in the great history of Olympique de Marseille," said McCourt, 63. "We're going to put our club back on the road to glory." Last season, angry Marseille fans criticised then owner Margarita Louis-Dreyfus, describing her as an "incompetent rich heiress".	American businessman Frank McCourt has bought French Ligue 1 club Marseille for 45m euros (£40.6m).
Jason Gillespie's side will launch the county season on 22 March when they play an MCC XI in Abu Dhabi in the traditional four-day curtain-raiser. The Championship begins on 12 April, with promoted Hampshire facing Sussex. The NatWest T20 Blast starts on 15 May and the Royal London One-Day Cup on 25 July, with holders Durham at Northants. The basic format for the summer remains unchanged with most Championship fixtures starting on Sundays, the majority of T20 Blast games on Friday evenings and the group stage of the 50-over One-Day Cup congested into a period of 26 days. The opening round of Championship games will also see Middlesex, a disappointing seventh in 2014, at home to Nottinghamshire and Somerset, with new director of cricket Matthew Maynard in charge for the first time, playing host to 2013 champions Durham. Only two matches will take place in Division Two in the opening week, with Leicestershire, who have not won a four-day game since 2012, but have a new head coach in Australian Andrew McDonald, taking on Glamorgan at Grace Road while relegated Northants, led by new four-day skipper Alex Wakely, at home to Gloucestershire. Ashley Giles, newly installed as Lancashire director of cricket, will have to wait an extra week until 19 April before his side's opening fixture away to Derbyshire as they look to regain their place in Division One at the first attempt. The second round of Division One games sees Yorkshire away again, this time meeting Notts at Trent Bridge, the ground where they clinched the title in September, while runners-up Warwickshire enter the fray by taking on 2014's Division Two champions Hampshire at Edgbaston. Lancashire's relegation means the only Roses clashes of the summer will take place in the T20 Blast, unless Lancashire and Yorkshire progress beyond the group stage of the One-Day Cup and are then drawn to face each other. Yorkshire will host the first T20 Roses fixture at Headingley on 5 June, with the return game on 3 July. Trophy holders Birmingham Bears, Warwickshire's guise for the format, who beat Lancashire by four runs in the 2014 final, meet Notts at Trent Bridge in their opening game on 15 May, with the two nine-team groups unchanged from 2014. The final round of group games takes place on Friday, 24 July, with the quarter-finals taking place from 12-15 August. Edgbaston will play host to finals day for the seventh time on Saturday, 29 August, six days later than this summer. The One-Day Cup final at Lord's, which Durham won with victory over Warwickshire by three wickets this summer, will take place on 19 September. The final again comes before the last round of Championship fixtures, starting on 22 September, in which Yorkshire will be at home to Sussex, who last won the title in 2007 but have boosted their pace bowling options by signing Ajmal Shahzad and Tymal Mills. Group A: Surrey, Derbyshire, Worcestershire, Yorkshire, Northants, Leicestershire, Gloucestershire, Somerset, Durham. Group B: Kent, Hampshire, Sussex, Essex, Lancashire, Middlesex, Nottinghamshire, Warwickshire, Glamorgan. North: Birmingham Bears (Warwickshire), Durham, Yorkshire, Lancashire, Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, Leicestershire, Worcestershire, Northants. South: Kent, Essex, Sussex, Hampshire, Middlesex, Surrey, Gloucestershire, Somerset, Glamorgan.	Champions Yorkshire will travel to promoted Worcestershire in the opening round of the 2015 County Championship to start the defence of their title.
Executive producer Al Jean said in a statement to the New York Times that Shearer had turned down a new pay deal. The show "will go on" and the actor's characters will be recast, Jean added. Shearer took to Twitter to say the decision "wasn't about money" and that signing up to a new series would have stopped him from doing other work. The 71-year-old provided the voice for addled school principal Seymour Skinner as well as rapacious millionaire Montgomery Burns and Ned Flanders, Homer Simpson's chipper neighbour. Shearer signalled his exit on Twitter by claiming that a lawyer for executive producer James L Brooks said: "Show will go on, Harry will not be part of it, wish him the best." In a follow-up tweet, Shearer added: "This because I wanted what we've always had: The freedom to do other work. Of course, I wish him the very best." In response, Al Jean wrote: "Harry Shearer was offered the same deal the rest of the cast accepted, and passed. "The show will go on and we wish him well. Maggie took it hard. "We do not plan to kill off characters like Burns and Flanders but will recast with the finest voiceover talent available." Last week, the Fox network confirmed it had commissioned two more series of the long-running animated sitcom. According to reports at the time, Shearer had yet to sign a new contract. On Thursday, the actor stressed that he had no plans to retire, adding: "On to new stuff..." His other roles have included bass player Derek Smalls in rock "mockumentary" This is Spinal Tap. The Simpsons has been on air since 1989, and the new series will take the total number of episodes to 625.	Harry Shearer, who voices Ned Flanders and Mr Burns in The Simpsons, is to leave the show after more than 25 years following a dispute with producers.
Richard Walsh, 43, was accused of attacking the two schoolboys, aged 12 and 13, in Havant, last month. He had been in custody at Belmarsh Prison in south-east London. Prison staff found Mr Walsh unresponsive in his cell on Sunday morning and, despite efforts to revive him, he was pronounced dead. A Prison Service spokeswoman said: "HMP Belmarsh prisoner Richard Walsh was found unresponsive in his cell on Sunday 19 July. Staff attempted CPR but paramedics pronounced him dead at 11.07am. "As with all deaths in custody there will be an investigation by the independent Prisons and Probation Ombudsman." Mr Walsh, who was also charged with assault and robbery in relating to the taking of a bicycle, had been due to appear at Portsmouth Crown Court on Monday.	A man who was facing trial for the attempted murder of two boys who were stabbed in a street in Hampshire has been found dead in his prison cell.
AFC Wimbledon are set for the big screen, having reached agreement with Hollywood studio Fox 2000 for a film to be made about the club. The Dons' story will be retold from its formation in 2002, when it held trials on Wimbledon Common. The phoenix club, founded by supporters after the old Wimbledon FC was given permission to relocate to Milton Keynes, reached the Football League in 2011 following five promotions in nine years. American author John Green, who sponsors a stand at the Cherry Red Records Stadium, will co-produce the film. "AFC Wimbledon isn't just one of the best underdog stories in sports history; it's also a story about a community that fought the injustice of the Milton Keynes debacle and is now fighting to have a stadium back in Wimbledon," Green told the club website. The film is in the early stages of development, with no script yet written or schedule for release. However, Matthew Breach, chair of the Dons Trust which owns the club, said the deal was "a fantastic opportunity to tell a great story". With the Dons currently 10th in League Two and attempting to reach the play-offs, it is not yet known whether the likes of manager Neal Ardley or striker Adebayo 'The Beast' Akinfenwa will have roles in the film. So the prospect of a Dons movie is fact, not fiction. But the same could not be said of the imaginative lines appearing on social media and club websites on Friday morning. Southampton were straight out of the blocks, informing fans they would be introducing a new club crest this summer. There would be one minor change to their current badge - replacing the halo-topped football at the top of their badge with an angel-face emoji. Meanwhile, Arsenal claimed they would be installing a retractable sunroof at the Emirates and Championship club Bristol City said 6ft 5in defender Aden Flint had signed a dual-registration deal with local basketball side Bristol Flyers. But perhaps best of all saw Hartlepool United announcing that the Football Association had given them permission to play in fancy dress on the final day of the season. Maybe both Pools and Wimbledon are in need of a good costume designer... Have you added the new Top Story alerts in the BBC Sport app?

Media playback is not supported on this device Mignolet struggled as the Reds twice gave away the lead in a thrilling 3-3 draw with the Premier League leaders. "For the second goal he needs help from all the players," said Klopp, in reference to Mignolet scrambling as Olivier Giroud scored from a corner. The Belgium goalkeeper, 27, is set to sign a new five-year contract. Mignolet, who joined the Reds from Sunderland in a £9m deal in June 2013, was also beaten at his near post by Aaron Ramsey for Arsenal's first equaliser. Klopp, who has consistently backed Mignolet, added: "On the second goal, on a perfect day he can make a save but there were a lot of mistakes before. "We have to defend this better." Liverpool's goalkeeping weaknesses have been exposed by errors from Mignolet's deputy Adam Bogdan in the 3-0 defeat at Watford and the 2-2 FA Cup draw at Exeter. That has prompted Klopp to recall 22-year-old Welshman Danny Ward, a substitute on Wednesday, from a successful loan spell at Aberdeen. Liverpool snatched a deserved draw with Arsenal thanks to Joe Allen's late equaliser. Roberto Firmino twice gave Liverpool the lead in a breathless first half, the second a spectacular 20-yard drive, but Arsenal levelled through Ramsey and Giroud. Giroud's second-half strike - his 18th goal of the season - looked to have put the Gunners on course for a crucial victory, but substitute Allen rewarded the hosts for a display bursting with energy and spirit with a low 90th-minute finish. Media playback is not supported on this device Klopp was delighted with the performance of Brazil forward Firmino, who has struggled to live up to his £29m transfer fee since arriving from Hoffenheim in the summer. The German said: "I could talk about this for half an hour. He doesn't know how good he is. If you are good, you have to show it. "He had a really good game but he was not the only one. I could talk about special performances - we had a lot of other players." Klopp was also involved in an angry first-half exchange with fourth official Robert Madley and was calmed down, amiably, by his opposite number Arsene Wenger. He said: "I told Arsene why I was a little bit emotional. It was a clear throw-in for us in a good moment, a good phase. I said what I said, he said what he said. "We had nothing, it was friendly."	Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp defended under-fire goalkeeper Simon Mignolet after his latest uncertain display in the draw with Arsenal at Anfield.
The raids by 19 RAF Lancaster bombers destroyed two strategically significant German dams and damaged a third. Taken by the Nazi authorities before and after the raids - on 16 and 17 May 1943 - the aerial images are stamped "Secret Command Document". The photographs were sold in Nottingham for Â£2,100 - considerably more than the list price of Â£1,200. As well as the time and date of the images, they also carry a warning forbidding them to be copied. The revolutionary bombs skipped across the lakes behind the dams and showed how precision attacks were possible in an age when most missions were lucky to get within miles of their target. Eight aircraft were lost and 56 of 133 aircrew were killed or captured.  An estimated 1,600 people died on the ground. International Autograph Auctions, of Nottingham, offered a set of reconnaissance images showing the Mohne and Edersee dams. Two pairs show the Mohne and Edersee dams before and after the attacks and a fifth image of a reserve dam on the Mohne reservoir shows how part of it had emptied out. Carl Buck, senior researcher at International Autograph Auctions, said: "The usual pictures we see of the dam raids are from photo-reconnaissance Spitfires despatched after the mission or close ups from Germany." Dambusters expert Charles Foster said: "The fascination with the Dambusters themselves is because it combined so many different things which contributed to the war effort - a revolutionary new weapon, supreme airmanship skills and raw courage in pressing home an attack under fire. "The fact that it was then immortalised in what is now regarded as one of the best ever British war films just adds to its mystique."	A set of rare photographs showing the impact of the Dambusters' "bouncing bomb" raids have been sold at auction.
Made from glass-reinforced plastic, 60 life-sized ewes have formed an art trail in unexpected places between Keswick and Windermere. Each sculpture is sponsored by a local business and decorated by an artist. The Lake District Calvert Trust said locals and tourists had been sharing photos of the "beautiful ladies" via social media every day. The Go Herdwick project is part of the trust's 40th anniversary to raise funds for a new facility at its Old Windebrowe site. The 60 ewes, inspired by London and Bristol's Shaun the Sheep figures, will be joined by 50 lambs to coincide with the reopening of the A591 in May. The trust's business manager, Justin Farnan, said: "The closure of the A591 could have been seen as a setback for us, but it will be open for the majority of the trail. "We are very pleased that Go Herdwick will be able to help drive tourist footfall to places such as Grasmere, both before and after the road is reopened, and that we can give something back to the wider community in what has been a difficult time for many businesses and residents." The Herdwicks will be rounded up and auctioned for the trust in October. The charity, which provides outdoor holidays for people with disabilities, will use the money to develop the Grade II-listed building at Old Windebrowe into a rehabilitation centre for people recovering from strokes and for those with brain injuries. Herdwick sheep are native to the Lake District and often graze at heights of about 3,000ft (915m). Recognised as one of the hardiest British sheep breeds, in 2013 it was awarded protected status by the European Commission.	A flock of decorated model sheep has invaded the Lake District in a bid to raise £1.3m for charity.
The Boeing 767 bound for Miami experienced an "uncontained engine failure", officials involved in the investigation said. The pilot aborted the take-off and evacuated everyone on board via emergency chutes as black smoke billowed from the plane. Twenty people suffered minor injuries, the fire department said. Nine crew members and 161 passengers were on board. A federal official quoted by the Associated Press news agency said the plane appeared to have suffered a rare and serious type of engine failure in which parts break off and are spewed outside the engine. Passengers reported an explosion followed by flames and black smoke as the plane was speeding down the runway. Sarah Ahmed said everyone on the right side of the plane rushed from their seats and moved to the left side. "People are yelling, 'Open the door! Open the door!' Everyone's screaming and jumping on top of each other to open the door," she told WLS-TV. "Within that time, I think it was seven seconds, there was smoke in the plane and the fire is right up against the windows, and it's melting the windows." The incident took place at 14:35 local time (19:35 GMT). An initial statement by Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said the plane had burst a tyre, but that information was later deleted from the statement. Why do people grab their bags after a plane crash? American Airlines said passengers who still wanted to travel had been put on another flight to Miami. Elsewhere, a FedEx plane caught fire at Fort Lauderdale, Florida, airport after its landing gear collapsed on landing, the FAA said.	An American Airlines plane has caught fire on the runway of Chicago's O'Hare airport while taking off.
Since being drafted in 2003, he has won two Super Bowls with the Pittsburgh Steelers and was awarded the 2010 defensive player of the year. Last year he missed four of the last seven games of the season because of a knee injury. He says that ending his professional career will give him a chance to "enjoy" his family. The Pittsburgh Steelers, the only team he has ever played professionally for, had asked him to retire earlier this year but he said he only agreed to the idea this week. "What it came down to was definitely family," he told Scout.com, revealing that he did not want to play elsewhere in the US. "What am I going to do now? I think the best I can do is make up for lost time, and that's with my family." Polamalu has two sons, aged seven and five, with his wife Theodora. "Thank God football has provided me the ability to be able to sit back and see what the options are. But I'll definitely be the best father I can possibly be." Born in the US, Polamalu is of Samoan descent. He is known for his iconic hairstyle, which he used to advertise shampoo. Speaking in 2010, he revealed that he had not cut his mass of hair for about a decade. Polamalu is part of the Greek Orthodox faith and he said that some of the numbers surrounding his retirement also appealed to him. "Thirty-three is obviously significant because of Christ being 33; and 12 years, 12 apostles," he said. "I'm not superstitious by any means but I always thought that if I played 12 years and retire from football at 33 and give my life and give my body and give my blood to this game, I think that would be a pretty significant landmark in my life."

De Gea, 24, reportedly wants to move to Real Madrid with speculation over his future persisting all summer. "We've observed him in training and matches and he's not the David De Gea of last year," said Van Gaal. New signing Sergio Romero, 28, Anders Lindegaard, 31, or Sam Johnstone, 22, could replace De Gea. Lindegaard and Johnstone travelled on the club's summer US tour, but neither played for United last season. Lindegaard did not feature once in the previous campaign, while Johnstone has yet to make his United debut. United also have Victor Valdes, but the 33-year-old Spaniard has been made available for transfer after Van Gaal claimed he "refused to play" in the reserves. "De Gea tries and does his utmost best, but it's a difficult situation," added Van Gaal. "Now we have to play our first match and I want players who can focus only on the match and he is not capable to do that. "He shall not play." De Gea has made 175 appearances since joining United from Real's city rivals Atletico Madrid in 2011. United are believed to be holding out for a deal that includes Real defender Sergio Ramos coming to Old Trafford. Angel Di Maria has written an open letter to United supporters, following his £44.3m move to Paris St-Germain. The 27-year-old Argentina midfielder conceded his one season at Old Trafford "did not go well". "I can guarantee you it was not for trying," he said in his letter. Media playback is not supported on this device "I did my best but football is not like maths: often a lot of things out of our control affect the way we feel and the way things turn out. "I am sorry it did not work out as I would have wished in this amazing, huge club." Van Gaal, who will reportedly sign Barcelona's Pedro as a replacement, said Di Maria's exit would be a "big loss". But the United boss suggested Di Maria may have struggled to adapt to life in the Premier League. "I want more attackers with speed and creativity," he said. "Di Maria is one of those players so we have to look for that kind of player, but they have to have the talent to cope with the English rhythm and that's difficult to find. "That's why players are not having success in this competition - because of the rhythm of the game and the English culture is a different culture to the Latin culture." Red Devils winger Ashley Young has signed a new deal until 2018, with the option of a further year. The 30-year-old England international has made 115 appearances and scored 13 goals since joining from Aston Villa for a reported £17m in 2011. Van Gaal described Young as a "multi-functional player" who "flourished" last season. Young said: "The spirit and motivation amongst this team is very high and we are all determined to make this a season to remember." New signing Bastian Schweinsteiger will not play against Spurs, with Van Gaal saying he lacks match fitness. There were concerns raised over the German's condition after Pep Guardiola, his boss at Bayern Munich, said the 31-year-old midfielder had not been fully fit for three years. "Schweinsteiger came to us at the last moment, out of his holidays," said Van Gaal. "I don't think he's fit enough, so we have to build him to the fitness I think he needs." Argentina defender Marcos Rojo is also not expected to start against Spurs.	Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal says keeper David De Gea is not "capable" of playing in Saturday's season opener against Tottenham.
The Royal Zoological Society of Scotland (RZSS) has placed male bear Arktos in with female Victoria at its Highland Wildlife Park near Aviemore. Polar bear cubs were last born in the UK almost 25 years ago. Arktos is one of two male bears at the park at Kincraig in the Cairngorms National Park. The pair could remain together for about two weeks. Arktos will eventually return to an enclosure he shares with the other male, Walker. RZSS said captive breeding was an important part of a wider effort to conserve polar bears, which are classified as "vulnerable" on the International Union Conservation of Nature's Red List of Threatened Species. However, animal welfare organisations OneKind Scotland and Born Free Foundation have said tackling climate change to better protect wild bears should be the focus of conservation efforts rather than captive breeding. RZSS, which also manages Edinburgh Zoo where efforts have been made to breed giant pandas, said Arktos and Victoria have mated several times so far. The society said the pair would live together for the next week or two "mimicking what would occur naturally in the wild". Vickie Larkin, head carnivore keeper at the park, said the pair had appeared to have bonded well since being introduced. She said: "Both polar bears have really warmed to each other and all the signs are really positive. "From the first moment they met, Arktos has been really gentle with Victoria and their bond has been immediate. "Polar bear breeding is inherently complex as the species are induced ovulators, meaning that the female only releases an egg after initial mating occurs. They also practice delayed implantation, where the egg doesn't implant into the uterine wall until some months later." Ms Larkin added: "If successful, Victoria will not fall pregnant until August to September time. "Other key stages are her entering the birthing den in October to November and potentially giving birth in December to January. Any cubs would then not come out of the birthing den until March to April 2017." Arktos arrived at the park in April 2012 from a zoo in Hannover, Germany. When being given health checks, park staff talk to Arktos in German, the language he heard when he was in the zoo in Hannover. Victoria, who was brought to Scotland from Aalborg Zoo in Denmark last year and is kept in an enclosure about a mile away from the males, previously raised cubs in 2008.	Polar bears involved in a Scottish captive breeding project are sharing an enclosure and mating.
Francois Hollande was taking part in a ceremony to mark 70 years since Allied troops liberated the last Nazi camps at the end of World War Two. "The worst can always happen," Mr Hollande said at the site of Natzweiler-Struthof in Alsace. "We prevent it by knowing." Most of the 50,000 inmates were French resistance fighters, but they also included Jews and gypsies. By the time of its liberation, almost half the prisoners had died. The Nazis built and tested one of their first gas chambers at the camp. France has been grappling with rising attacks on both Jews and Muslims after deadly shootings by Islamist gunmen in January, sparking fresh debate about growing social tensions, says the BBC's Lucy Williamson in Paris. Commemorations have also been held in northern Germany to mark the 70th anniversary of the liberation of the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, where an estimated 70,000 people were killed, including the young Jewish diarist Anne Frank. The president of the World Jewish Congress, Ronald Lauder, remembered the first shocking images to emerge from the camp. "We saw the bulldozers pushing naked bodies into open pits," he said, according to AFP news agency. He remembered "the walking skeletons, the unbelievable sadness and loss," at a ceremony attended by about 70 survivors. Another emotional ceremony took place at the site of another camp - Jasenovac in Croatia - to mark the 70th anniversary of an escape attempt by about 600 inmates. Only 80 or 90 inmates escaped, with the rest shot by guards.	France's president has warned that anti-Semitism and racism "are still here" on a visit to the only Nazi concentration camp on French soil.
Scott Ludlam, 46, who is deputy leader of the Australian Greens party, made the announcement in a Facebook post. He said he had been dealing with mental health issues "for a while". "I will return to work as soon as I'm able to give the commitment the work demands," Senator Ludlam wrote. "I am fortunate to be getting the very best of care from my friends and family, and my health professionals," he added. Figures from across Australian politics wished Mr Ludlam well on social media, praising his honesty. "Wishing my dear friend and colleague @SenatorLudlam all the best for a speedy recovery. We love you Scott," Australian Greens chief Richard Di Natale tweeted. Western Australia Labor Leader Mark McGowan wrote: "Thinking of you @SenatorLudlam. A brave thing to do today. All WA parliamentarians wish you the very best. MM." As the news spread on Twitter, many Australians spoke of their respect for the Greens leader, suggesting that his openness would help others who are fighting mental health battles. During his absence, Senator Ludlam will be offered a "pair" in the Australian Senate. This means a single vote on the opposing side of debates will be cancelled out for as long as he is on leave. Mr Ludlam is a popular figure among young left-wingers in Australia, and has been vocal about online privacy issues. In 2015 he branded the Australian government's new national security legislation a privacy invasion, and provided a list of ways for people to circumvent data retention laws. The senator said his work for Western Australia - which includes communications, international aid, defence, foreign affairs and nuclear technology spheres - would be handled by "senate colleagues" and "the team in my office". According to the Sydney Morning Herald, a large number of Australian MPs have admitted privately that they struggle to cope with alcoholism, feelings of isolation, and stress from marriage breakdowns or scandals. Warren Entsch, a Liberal party leader and former MP, told the Herald he was left in "absolute hell" back in 1999 when the opposition Labor party were pursuing him over a defence contract they said was dodgy. "I was sick. I was devastated. I had to go to Canberra Hospital for chest pains. There were a couple of days where I couldn't get off the couch in my office," he said. "I always feel for someone who is getting beaten up by the media - what you go through from a mental health perspective is absolutely intense." Former MP Doctor Malcolm Washer, a qualified GP who was known as "the doctor in the house", has claimed there is a "significant" amount of depression among Australian politicians, adding that the job is "very isolating". He has estimated that around 20% of people working in Parliament House are taking anti-depressants, and many more are on sleeping pills. Mr Ludlam is not the first senior leader to go public about his depression. Former Liberal MP Andrew Robb took leave for six months in 2010 to address the condition, and is now a passionate advocate for mental health. Scott Ludlam is one of a number of high-profile figures who have spoken about their mental health issues in recent days. Singer Zayn Malik, a former member of the wildly successful boyband One Direction, has talked about his battle with "extreme anxiety", saying: "Anxiety is something people don't necessarily want to advertise because it's seen, in a way, like a weakness." The 23-year-old said he had pulled out of several live performances earlier this year due to mental health struggles. Why do pop stars struggle with anxiety? Anxiety 'seen as weakness' says Malik 'So did I': The words that helped a mum through postnatal depression "I speak about it so that people understand that it doesn't matter what level of success you have, where you're from, who you are, what sex you are, what you do - you can still experience these things," Mr Malik told ES magazine. Another world-famous singer, Adele, shared her experience of postnatal depression after the birth of her son Angelo. She told Vanity Fair that while she "loves her son more than anything", she sometimes felt she had made "the worst decision" of her life as she struggled to adjust to motherhood. She told the magazine a breakthrough came when she opened up, admitting: "One day I said to a friend, 'I ****** hate this,' and she just burst into tears and said, 'I ****** hate this, too."	An Australian senator has been flooded with support after announcing he is taking a leave of absence to treat depression and anxiety.
Rother District Council said the temporary RNLI lifeguard service would "reassure the public and advise on safety" at the East Sussex beach. It follows the deaths on Wednesday of the five men in their teens and 20s from south-east London. Relatives have criticised the lack of lifeguards at Camber. The men who died have been named by police as: Last month, 19-year-old Brazilian Gustavo Silva Da Cruz also died while swimming in the sea at Camber. Rother councillor Sally-Ann Hart said safety was under constant review but Camber had been categorised as a safe beach. "Having said that, the RNLI are providing a temporary service this weekend. "They are redeploying services from other beaches around the country to provide reassurance to visitors and holidaymakers in view of the recent tragedies, because they are horrendous. "It might well be that lifeguards may be deployed in the future when all the evidence is looked at as to what caused these deaths." Rother council previously said that beach patrols were on duty to advise beachgoers of potential dangers. But Mr Ravi's sister Mayura, 17, said the family was angry the stretch of beach where the men died had not been blocked off following Mr Da Cruz's death. Mr Ravi's brother Ajirthan, 19, said: "There weren't any lifeguards cruising around. "Because they would have quickly noticed these boys drowning, and could have at least save their lives." An online petition calling for lifeguards at Camber Sands has been signed by more than 7,000 people. The RNLI said the council had accepted its offer to provide five or six lifeguards on Saturday, Sunday and Monday between 09:00 and 18:00 BST who would work alongside the Rother beach patrols. The charity has said the five men could have got into trouble after failing to realise how quickly the tide would come in. It said it believed all five men fell into deep channels of water between sand-bars - mounds of sand created by wave and tide activity - which had been made deeper with the weekend storms. A sand-bar is a submerged or partly exposed ridge of sand or other sediment built up by currents in coastal waters that occur where waves break. They are usually made up of sand but can also involve other granular materials, such as shingle or even boulders. They are most pronounced in the heavy surf caused by storms. Sand-bars are the most common cause of rip currents, which are generated by waves breaking over them. The RNLI said that the sand-bars at Camber Sands were three feet deep and had been made deeper by the weekend storms. Satellite images of the area give an idea of how the sandbars create an uneven sea floor.	Lifeguards are to be deployed over the bank holiday weekend at Camber Sands, where five friends died during a day trip to the coast.
The Beyond Caravaggio exhibition features the work of the Italian artist and 30 other artists from all over Europe who were influenced by him. It is a collaboration with the National Galleries in London and Dublin. Edinburgh is the last stop for the works inspired by the man known as the "bad boy" of early 17th Century art. This is the first exhibition of works by Caravaggio and his followers ever to be shown in Scotland. Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio was just 39 when he died in 1610. Four years earlier he had murdered a man after a quarrel over a game of tennis and spent the rest of his life as a fugitive. Christopher Baker, the acting director of the Scottish National Gallery, told BBC Scotland that Caravaggio was a "revolutionary artist". He said: "You could see him as the archetypal bad boy artist who in his private life has a tempestuous time, who behaves appallingly, who is often in the courts and who is on the run having committed murder. "In addition to all of that he is a great creative force. "He produces these extraordinary pictures, which unsurprisingly, had an extraordinary impact and inspired other painters, who travelled to Rome and Naples from right across Europe and thought 'I need to do that, I want a piece of that as well'. "That is the story this exhibition tells." One of the paintings in the exhibition, The Taking of Christ (1602), is from the National Gallery of Ireland, where it is on indefinite loan from the Jesuit Community in Dublin. It was rediscovered in 1990 in a Jesuits' residence in the Irish capital. Aidan Weston-Lewis, the curator of exhibition at the Scottish National Gallery, said it was "frustrating" to think that it was offered to the Scottish National Gallery for free in 1921 and turned down. He said it was the only painting by Caravaggio that has ever been in a Scottish private collection. It was bought by Scottish country gentleman William Hamilton Nisbet in Rome in 1802, directly from the Mattei family who had commissioned it 200 years earlier. The painting was on display at Biel House in East Lothian for 120 years. Mr Weston-Lewis said: "His descendants bequeathed a large group of pictures from that collection to the Scottish National Gallery. "We didn't have space for them all. "They were paraded in front of the trustees at the next board meeting and some were selected and some weren't. "Very sadly from our point of view this painting got away. It was turned down." Mr Weston-Lewis said the painting had been mistakenly re-attributed to a Caravaggio follower but even so the reputation of the Italian artist was so low at this time that the painting would not have been thought worth saving. He said: "There was a degree of ignorance. It was only in the middle of the 20th Century that his reputation was resurrected fully. "Now one could argue he's probably the most popular of all Old Master painters, or certainly up there among them." Caravaggio's dramatic lighting and compositions, and his radically new approach to subject matter, exerted a huge influence on artists such as Gentileschi, Ribera, Valentin and Ter Brugghen. Mr Baker said: "It is not just the style of painting but the new types of subject matter, often secular subjects that he excelled at producing, that thrilled other people. "But also it's gaming, being in pubs, misbehaving, having a good time, this heady world of pleasure comes into painting at this moment through him, and that's what everybody else wants a bit of." The four paintings by Caravaggio to be shown in the exhibition include The Supper at Emmaus (1601) and Boy bitten by a Lizard (about 1594-5) as well as The Taking of Christ (1602). Ribera's The Martyrdom of St Bartholomew (1634), which was in the Cranstoun family collection at Corehouse in Lanarkshire for more than 170 years, has been borrowed for this exhibition from the National Gallery of Art in Washington. Another painting, Christ displaying his Wounds (c.1625-35) by Spadarino, has been borrowed from Perth Museum and Art Gallery. Beyond Caravaggio is on display at the National Galleries in Scotland from 17 June to 24 September. Entrance to the exhibit costs Â£12.	Four paintings by Renaissance Old Master Caravaggio are the centrepiece of a major exhibition at the National Galleries of Scotland.
Four-month-old Ted visits Wales twice a month to see his grandparents in Carmarthenshire and the TV star hopes he will be brought up to be bilingual. He will be heading back again with his mother for the Champions League final. Ms Jones will present a One Show special from Cardiff on Friday, the eve of the men's match. The 40-year-old, who returned from maternity leave to the BBC One show part-time in April, said she was excited to be in the city for an event of such magnitude. "Working in Cardiff is a dream for me - the city will be buzzing," she said. "That's one of the best things about Cardiff - when we're hosting events like this the city comes alive." The Ammanford-born star lived in Cardiff for years and said it still felt like her home, adding she missed it "lots and lots". As a Welsh speaker herself, Ms Jones said she hoped to pass on the language to her son and had spoken about it with her husband, Charlie Thomson, who is from New Zealand. "It's hard in London but I will definitely speak Welsh to him and Charlie knows the odd word," she said. "There's a Welsh primary school here [in London]  and I would love him to go there. "It's part of my heritage and is a big part of my identity. It's a big thing for me for Ted to experience it - I really benefitted from being bilingual." She admitted it had been "tough" going back to work with such a young baby, although she joked that The One Show was "a break" from the "really hard job of motherhood". "Going back part-time was the right thing to do - it's good for Ted to know women work," she added. "And actually it comes down to necessity, there's no choice, I have to work." She said she was looking forward to showing The One Show team "Cardiff at its best" and will even host a tour of the city for the programme, which she will be co-hosting with Patrick Kielty and Jason Mohammad from Cardiff Bay. Top of her must-see sights? "It's got to be Cardiff Castle," she said. "There's a lot of history for us there as we got married there. It has beautiful grounds for a picnic and has lots of interesting history. And the view from the top is spectacular. "I'm a bit out of the loop with where to go for a night out having had a baby but you can't go wrong with Cardiff Bay on a sunny evening." It is, perhaps, where she will be heading after finishing her live broadcast for The One Show on Friday. "I'm having my first night out with my friends since having the baby afterwards," she added. "It's going to be amazing. I know Cardiff will do us proud." The One Show - Live in Cardiff is on BBC One at 19:00 BST on Friday, 2 June	The One Show presenter Alex Jones has spoken of her wish to teach her baby son to speak Welsh but admits it might be a struggle while living in London.
Residents and an official said the victims were travelling in a pick-up truck that was targeted in the Hiran district of Hajja province. They had been heading to a local market, according to the residents. There was no immediate comment from the coalition, which is fighting the Houthi rebel movement in a bid to restore the internationally recognised government. The coalition says it does not target civilians, but the UN says air strikes have caused the majority of the more than 4,125 civilian deaths recorded since the conflict in Yemen escalated in March 2015. Wednesday's incident comes two days after a 48-hour cessation of hostilities ended. Both sides accused each other of repeated violations of the truce, which brought a brief respite from air strikes for residents of the rebel-controlled capital, Sanaa. Fighting continued in and around the south-western city of Taiz throughout the weekend, however, and on Tuesday clashes there reportedly left 11 people dead. Military officials said pro-government forces had repelled an attack on Taiz's western outskirts by Houthis and allied security personnel loyal to former President Ali Abdullah Saleh. The International Committee of the Red Cross expressed alarm on Tuesday at the situation in Taiz, where some 300,000 people have been under siege by rebel forces for more than a year. "Sniper fire and indiscriminate shelling has trapped civilians. Dead bodies are in the streets and people are unable to attend to their most basic needs. The situation is desperate," said the ICRC's head of delegation in Yemen, Alexandre Faite. Mr Faite added that the main hospitals in Taiz had reported receiving an average of 200 wounded in three days. Many patients were suffering from blast injuries and had to have limbs amputated.	Twelve civilians are reported to have been killed in a Saudi-led coalition air strike in north-western Yemen.
Patients often die before their 40s as mucus clogs and damages their lungs and leaves them prone to infection. A major trial on 1,108 patients, in the New England Journal of Medicine, showed a combination of drugs could bypass the genetic errors that cause the disease and may increase life expectancy. The Cystic Fibrosis Trust said it could "improve the lives of many". One in every 2,500 babies in the UK has cystic fibrosis. Errors in sufferers' DNA - inherited from their parents - damage the microscopic machinery that controls salt and water levels in the linings of the lungs. The result is a thick mucus that inexorably damages the lungs. Antibiotics help prevent infection and drugs can loosen the mucus, but nothing deals with the fundamental problem for most patients. The combination of drugs - lumacaftor and ivacaftor - were designed to repair that microscopic machinery. The trial showed that those patients given the cocktail for 24 weeks had better lung function. Cystic fibrosis also affects the mucus lining in the gut so the doctors were pleased to see the patients also gained weight in the trial. Prof Stuart Elborn, who led the European part of the trial from Queen's University Belfast, told the BBC News website: "This is very exciting and it really demonstrates that we can correct the basic defects in cystic fibrosis. "This is likely to become a fundamental treatment for cystic fibrosis. "Starting in children may prevent the disease process developing if we correct the basic defect early in life. "Will this improve survival for people with cystic fibrosis?  We would anticipate it would have a really good chance of doing that, but we don't know for sure yet." There are however, many types of error in the DNA that can culminate in cystic fibrosis. This treatment combination should work on around half of patients, while one of the drugs on its own corrects a small proportion of errors. New treatments are still required for the remaining patients. Susanna McColley, professor of paediatrics at Northwestern University, said these were "groundbreaking findings" that showed the future of treating cystic fibrosis. She told the BBC: "For subjects I've cared for, they felt better in ways that are not necessarily measurable. "One young woman said, and this is a direct quote, her CF 'is not a problem'." Janet Allen, the director of research at the Cystic Fibrosis Trust charity, said: "These results open up a new front in the fight against cystic fibrosis and this combination therapy looks set to be an important additional treatment option that could improve the lives of many. "As this leading edge of science continues to be explored and better understood, we are hopeful that a future of personalised medicines is increasingly within reach." The therapy is being examined by regulators around the world.	A "groundbreaking" cystic fibrosis therapy could profoundly improve patients' quality of life, say doctors.
Hythe Ferry runs between Hythe and Southampton, serviced by a train which runs along a 640m (2,000ft) pier. The presenter lent his support to a community group's aim to take over the management of the pier and train. Its current operator said numbers using the ferry had been falling. Earlier this year, Hythe Ferry Ltd warned staff about possible redundancies, having suffered a "year-on-year decline" in passenger numbers and faced with higher operating costs. More than 9,000 people have signed a petition calling for the service to be saved. Peter King, of the Hythe Hythe Pier Train and Ferry Action Group, said members wanted to create a "viable modern ferry" by a charitable trust taking over the management of the Victorian pier and "relieving" the ferry operators of the costs of maintaining it. He said a redevelopment project could cost £2-3m but a trust would be able to access other sources of finance, including lottery grants. Mr Snow said: "This train is the oldest running pier train anywhere in the world, so I'm campaigning to keep it open. We need to do everything we can to keep this extraordinary piece of our past running."	A Hampshire pier and ferry service facing an uncertain future is a "national treasure" which should be saved, television historian Dan Snow has said.
She plays a no-nonsense character in House of Cards, and in real life Robin Wright is no different. For four seasons, viewers have seen her in the role of Claire Underwood, the Machiavellian partner of stop-at-nothing politician, Frank Underwood, played by Kevin Spacey. Both actors have also directed and produced episodes of the show. But while their roles are equally prominent, for years their salaries were not in parity. "I was like, 'I want to be paid the same as Kevin.' It was a perfect paradigm and example to use, because there are very few films or TV shows where the maleâ€”the patriarch and the matriarch are equal. And they are in House of Cards," she told an audience at New York's Rockefeller Foundation. Wright looked at statistics which showed that for some time, her character was more popular than Spacey's. "So I capitalised on it. I was like, 'You better pay me or I'm going to go publicâ€¦and they did.'" Wright's success at equalising her pay is a story to be noted, because it is still incredibly rare. "She is playing a popular and important character in a series. She has leverage and she used it," says Lisa Maatz, vice president for government relations at the American Association of University Women (AAUW), which has conducted research into the broader issue. "I admire her for standing up to them. Not everybody is going to be as fortunate. But her situation in terms of being underpaid is far too common." US government statistics show that on average, women are paid less than their male counterparts, 79 cents for every dollar a man earns. According to the White House, the median wage of a woman working full-time all year in America is about $39,600 (Â£27,116), 79% of a man's median earnings, which stand at $50,400. The statistic is widely used to illustrate the discrepancy in pay across the sexes, and looks across all sectors. In Fresno, California, Aileen Rizo took a similar stand against her employer after she learned she was receiving less pay than a new male employee, who didn't have a masters degree like she did. Ms Rizo had been working as a maths consultant for four years for Fresno County Office of Education, when she found out that the new hire was being paid at the highest salary scale (a nine), while she was being paid at the lowest (a one). When she confronted her human resources department about the difference, she was told it wasn't a mistake. "They said they'd used my prior pay as a guide, and that's why I was on less," she explained. Ms Rizo began legal action against her employers in 2013, who argued they set wages based on the employee's most recent salary, plus a five percent increase. Experience wasn't a determining factor, they said. Representatives for Fresno County pointed out that a woman working in the same department as Ms Rizo, was being paid more, and said that in the past 25 years more women had been on higher salary scales, than men in the same or similar position in the department. The court ruled in Ms Rizo's favour, arguing that the fact another woman earned more than her, shouldn't diminish her right to a fair wage.  Her employers appealed the decision, and the case is still ongoing. Since she began her lawsuit, Ms Rizo is now receiving the same pay as her male colleague, but she continues to fight for backdated wages. She also testified before the California legislature, which has since passed an Equal Pay Act in the state. While she believes employers need to be more transparent and fair, she does also think women could also do more. "We do need to get better at negotiating. I was trusting an organisation to act in a way of integrity. I took for granted that that's where everyone started." "Whether you have to file a lawsuit or demand it and get it, women need to empower others and educate society about a problem that's still evident," she says. But the scale of the problem is something which is widely debated. Some critics say the "79 cents for every dollar" statistic is misleading, because it doesn't compare two people working in the same job, with the same background and qualifications. When those factors are taken into account, there still is a gender pay gap, but the percentage difference is much smaller, at around 7%. "The idea that when a young woman graduates, the idea she's going to get paid 79 cents for every dollar a man makes, working in the same job, across our economy is a myth," argues Karin Agness, who is president of the Network of Enlightened Women, a conservative policy group. Ms Agness believes that the 79 cents statistic gives young graduates a false impression of the workplace they're about to enter. "It creates a victim mentality in women, and we don't want our young women going into the workforce thinking they are victims just because they are women," she says. But Lisa Maatz from the AAUW says both measures are valid - one is more general, the other specifically compares similar roles - but both point to a discrepancy which needs to be addressed. "The gender wage gap has many causes and contributors, including differences in education, experience, occupation and industry, and family responsibilities. But even after accounting for these factors, a gap still remains between men's earnings and women's earnings," argues a White House report on the issue. Data on the pay gap for Hispanic and black women shows greater disparities. The gap between similar jobs fluctuates wildly based on the sector. And even controlling for similar jobs, the gap grows for women who are promoted into the director and executive level. For Ms Maatz, there are other areas which also need to be addressed when it comes to wage disparity, for example the rise of so-called "pink collar" jobs, in which certain roles such as nurses, secretaries and teachers, are devalued simply because more women do them. But Robin Wright's experience is a reminder that the gender pay gap affects women across all professions. She hopes her example will encourage other women to speak up. "It's a male dominant workplace society. It always has been. And that's just the history. "But it has to be unacceptable at this stage."

Fields around organic farms have more types of wild plants, providing benefits for wildlife, say scientists. The research is likely to fuel the debate over the environmental benefits of organic farming. Studies suggest that organic farming produces lower yields than conventional methods but harbours more wildlife. The new study, by researchers at the University of Swansea and institutes in France, looked at fields sowed with winter wheat in the region of Poitou-Charente. They found that organic farming led to higher weed diversity on surrounding conventionally farmed fields. "Wild plants are important for birds, bees and other farmland species," said Dr Luca Borger of the department of biosciences at Swansea University. "Organic farming has advantages in maintaining these, but even a mixture of organic and non-organic farming in an area can help maintain this biodiversity. "Even only 25% of fields being organically farmed can make a difference." Farmland provides essential habitat for many animals but intensification of agriculture has led to a loss of biodiversity. However, in order to provide the extra food needed by the bigger human population of the future, without destroying forests and wetlands, farming needs to be made more intensive. Supporters of organic farming say the method could be a potential compromise between meeting food security needs and providing habitat for bees, birds and other wildlife. The researchers say land-sharing between organic farms and non-organic farms could have benefits for both crop production and biodiversity. This theory needs to be tested in follow-up studies, they say. The study is published in the journal, Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B- Biological Sciences.	Organic farms act as a refuge for wild plants, offsetting the loss of biodiversity on conventional farms, a study suggests.
Gerard Kevin Hughes, 29, and Gavin Martin Hughes, 31, who are both from Springfield Park in Belfast, appeared in court alongside their older brother Joseph Christopher Hughes, 35, from The Meadows in Downpatrick. The trio all appeared at Belfast Crown Court. The charges arose from incidents in 2013. The court hearing was told that on 9 October, 2013, a car driven by Gavin Hughes was stopped in north Belfast, and when the vehicle was stopped a black plastic bag was located on the passenger seat. The bag contained five compact cubes of cocaine which amounted to 1.27 kilos of the Class A drug. When Gavin Hughes was searched, another amount of cocaine was found in the pockets of his jeans, and he was taken into custody. The following day, officers travelled to an address in the Ligoniel area of the city, which at the time was being rented by Gavin Hughes. When they arrived, police found Gavin's two brothers Gareth and Joseph at the property. Both the property and a vehicle parked outside the house were searched, and further packages of cocaine were seized, alongside items and equipment associated with mixing drugs. Also located during the search were 21 ecstasy tablets. The court heard it was the Crown's case that the rented property was being used to mix the cocaine and prepare it for sale. The total amount of cocaine seized on 9 and 10 October 2013 amounted to 3.25 kilos. The Hughes brothers subsequently pleaded guilty to a number of drugs offences, while Gerard Hughes also admitted two further offences - namely possession of cannabis with intent to supply, and possession of amphetamine on 6 August, 2013. These offences were linked to the seizure of drugs in a car park in east Belfast. Regarding the drugs seizures in October 2013, Gavin Hughes pleaded guilty to five charges, including possessing cocaine with intent to supply. He was handed a four-year sentence and was told he will serve a year in prison, with the remaining three years on licence upon his release. His brother Gerard - who appeared on charges arising from two separate incidents in August and October 2013 - was handed a sentence of five years. Half of this sentence will be spent in jail, with the remaining two years and six months on licence when he is released from prison. Joseph Hughes, who pleaded guilty to a single charge of possessing cocaine with intent to supply, was given a three-year sentence. Six months of this will be spent in jail, with the remaining 30 months on supervised licence upon his release.	Three brothers from Belfast have been jailed for drugs offences linked to a significant seizure of cocaine.
Bids have been submitted by Abellio, Arriva, KeolisAmey and MTR for the next Wales and Borders franchise. The successful bidder will have to make a slice of its profits available to be reinvested in the railway. They will also be responsible for delivering a major upgrade to the rail network in and around Cardiff as part of the Metro scheme. A contract will be awarded in early 2018. The four bids are being assessed by Transport for Wales (TfW), a Welsh government-owned company, as part of what ministers said would be an "ambitious and creative not for profit model". Officials said the four preferred bidders were the only four to come forward for the contract. The Welsh government has set out its ambitions for the Metro but it will be up to the bidders to propose how it will operate, as well as drawing up plans to build a new rail or tram system. Analysis by Sarah Dickins, BBC Wales economics correspondent This is the first time that the Welsh Government has awarded a rail franchise. It did not have the power to do so when the all-Wales franchise was awarded to Arriva. The model this time will focus on what level and quality of service the various bidders can offer. They will be asked to outline what they will do to drive up the numbers of passengers taking trains and buses across Wales. While the Metro for south Wales will be part of the bid, the company's proposals will also be scrutinised in terms of how they will affect all geographical locations. Whichever company wins will have a cap set on how much profit they can make. We do not yet know at what level that will be set but once that is passed remaining profit will go to the body responsible - Transport for Wales - to be reinvested in public transport in Wales. That cap will be for negotiation. Each company is expected to put together its own particular mix of heavy rail, bus and possibly light rail. The preferred contractor is expected to be known by early 2018. Negotiations are underway with Network Rail about handing over responsibility for the track on the core Valleys lines to the franchise holder. The current franchise is run by Arriva Trains Wales which gets a subsidy from the Welsh Government of between £150m and £180m a year. Rail privatisation laws stop the Welsh Government giving the contract to public sector bodies. The Welsh Government has lobbied for more powers, but said its requests have been turned down in Westminster. Officials said in time TfW may evolve to take on more responsibilities, similar to Transport for London. Economy Secretary Ken Skates said new trains, quicker journeys and modernised technology were priorities for the franchise. "We now have four highly skilled, experienced companies entering the next, competitive phase and I am keen to hear more from them about what they can offer Wales and how they can deliver on our plans for integrated public transport," he said. "Over the next 10 years I envisage significant strides in the delivery of our public transport network including the electrification of the Swansea, Valleys and north Wales lines, a South and North Wales Metro and widespread structural improvements that are already in the pipeline."	Four foreign-owned firms are competing to run train services in Wales and create the £600m South Wales Metro.
Kulbhushan Jadhav was arrested in the restive Balochistan province and accused of "espionage and sabotage activities against Pakistan". Last month a top UN court told Pakistan not to execute Mr Jadhav until it had time to hear a case brought by India. India dismissed the mercy petition and a "confessional video" by Mr Jadhav. Pakistan on Thursday released a statement that said Mr Jadhav had sought "forgiveness for his actions" and had "requested the Chief of Army Staff to spare his life on compassionate grounds". India, which denies Mr Jadhav is a spy, has dismissed Pakistan's statement and a second "confessional" video by Mr Jadhav saying, "India expects Pakistan to desist from attempting to influence the proceedings at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in the case through false propaganda". "The developments bring out once again the lack of transparency and farcical nature of proceedings against Jadhav on concocted charges, continued violation of his legal and consular rights and an attempt to introduce prejudice in the proceedings in the ICJ," external affairs ministry spokesperson Gopal Baglay told reporters on Thursday. Last month India argued in the ICJ that Pakistan violated international laws by not allowing it access to Mr Jadhav since he was arrested in Balochistan in March 2016. Meanwhile, there are differing accounts of how and where Mr Jadhav was detained. Pakistan says he was detained on 3 March 2016 in restive Balochistan province, which has been hit by a separatist insurgency that Islamabad accuses India of backing. India says he was kidnapped by Pakistan while he was in Iran. The nuclear-armed neighbours have a long history of diplomatic spats, and Delhi and Islamabad often accuse each other of sending spies into their territories.	A former Indian navy officer who has been sentenced to death on charges of spying in Pakistan has filed a mercy petition, the Pakistan military says.
All 42 of its member clubs are expected to take strict disciplinary measures against fans who indulge in anti-social behaviour during matches. The updated guidance, which comes into force immediately, states that home clubs are responsible for "good order and security". Clubs are also urged to step up efforts to identify culprits. Under the previous rules, clubs could argue that they had taken all practical steps to deter misbehaviour inside their stadiums. Now they must been seen to actively pursue cases and take "appropriate" action against the perpetrators. In June, following disorder at the Scottish Cup final, Justice Secretary Michael Matheson called for "a transparent and robust scheme" to prevent and deal with unacceptable conduct. He went on to warn: "The Scottish government is prepared to act if Scottish football isn't." On the rule changes, SPFL chief executive Neil Doncaster said: "The SPFL and its member clubs are committed to preventing and to addressing unacceptable conduct where it arises, to ensure our stadiums are friendly, welcoming and safe environments where all supporters can enjoy Scottish football. "This ongoing work includes this updated guidance for clubs which sets out the reasonably practicable measures that member clubs can take to address this issue and to identify and sanction those who engage in unacceptable conduct. "It has been fully consulted on with all 42 clubs, the Scottish FA and the Scottish Government and, indeed, dialogue continues with the Government on a number of further measures which will be discussed early this year."	The Scottish Professional Football League has issued new regulations aimed at tackling supporter misconduct.
Chris and Sue Moores's son Wayne died when his motorbike was struck by a drink driver in 2010. The couple spoke out in response to consultation on proposed reform of sentencing for driving offences. They believe increased sentences should be backed up by manslaughter charges. Mr Moores, 28, was killed by a Vauxhall Astra driven by Donna Hackett on the M4 near Swindon. Hackett, then aged 26, fled and was found by police asleep in a ditch. She served half of a six-year jail term after she was found guilty of causing death by careless driving while drunk. The Ministry of Justice consultation suggests offenders who cause death by careless driving while under the influence of drink or drugs could soon be handed a life sentence - an increase on the current 14-year upper limit. Source: Crown Prosecution Service But Mr and Mrs Moores, from Chandlers Ford, Hampshire, also want the offence to be upgraded to a charge of manslaughter. Mr Moores said: "Somebody can drive drunk and kill my son. Why is that not manslaughter? "Nothing can prepare a parent for seeing their child in the mortuary. That will stay with me every day, every day that vision comes into my mind. "Our life is ruined." Mrs Moores added: "There's nothing careless about drink driving. I don't want anybody else to feel like us." Ms Hackett, who lived in Radnor Street, Swindon, at the time of the offence, appealed against her sentence in September 2011, but was refused. A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: "We are determined to make sure those who kill whilst driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs face the full force of the law. "That is why we are consulting on plans that will see the maximum sentence for a number of offences in this area increase from 14 years to life." A response to the Ministry of Justice consultation, which closes on 1 February, is due to be published by May.	A proposal to introduce life sentences for the offence of careless driving while under the influence of drink or drugs does not go far enough, according to the parents of one victim.
The stowaway was identified by Chinese media as a 16-year-old boy from Sichuan named Xu. He was found on 27 May, hiding in the cargo hold of flight EK303 from Shanghai. The official Xinhua news agency and the Chengdu Economic Daily reported the boy had said he did it because he had heard beggars in Dubai could make 470,000 yuan ($71,275; Â£49,300) a month. Earlier this year, there was a story being shared widely on the Twitter-like Sina Weibo with the hashtag #DubaiBeggarsMake470000YuanMonthly. The China Daily report said non-United Arab Emirates citizens were making a fortune begging, some making 270,000 dirhams (that is where the 470,000 yuan figure comes from). At the time, people online were saying they were "prepared to go begging in Dubai" and some posts showed flight tickets with the caption "Do not stop me going". After Tuesday's story about Xu the hashtag is trending once again, with some people expressing amusement and others being much more critical. "People with dreams deserve praises," said Chi Ma Xiao De Xiao Ma Fa. But Kai Ge Lu - Deng Ta Hui Lai said on Weibo: "Are people who praise the teenager being serious? Everyone knows that entering the country in that way is illegal. "Also, the teenager wants to reap without sowing if he wants to be a beggar in Dubai to make money." Some users were blaming the media for spreading rumours about the riches of Dubai. On CCTV's official Weibo account, a user left the comment: "Media that have been publishing inaccurate reports should bear responsibility. They should be held accountable." BBC Chinese also spoke to two travellers from Shanghai to Dubai who thought social media reports had misled the boy. So is there any truth to the story? The China Daily report appears to be based on a story on Gulf News from April this year when Dubai police arrested a beggar who they said was making 270,000 dirhams per month. Dubai police carry out campaigns to stop begging on the streets and the man was arrested as part of the raid. Police said they had caught "professional" beggars, some of them carrying passports with business or tourist visas, but did not say how many of the 59 beggars detained were found with large amounts of money. Reporting by Grace Tsoi, Yashan Zhao, Saira Asher and Kerry Allen	The story of a Chinese teenager who stowed away on a plane to Dubai, reportedly hoping to make money there as beggar, has sparked a conversation in China about misinformation.
Jonathan Platt successfully contested a fine from Isle of Wight Council for taking his young daughter on a family holiday to Florida in April. He will now speak up on behalf of other parents when the council seeks High Court clarification on the law. He is crowdfunding for Â£25,000 expected legal costs and raised more than Â£1,000 in the first 24 hours. The father wrote on the fundraising page he would spend the money on "nothing other than legal fees for solicitors and barristers". He added: "I will take nothing personally from the money, not even travelling costs." Isle of Wight Council is asking the High Court for clarification on what constitutes "regular" attendance at school. As Mr Platt is a "person of interest" in the case, he has a right to attend. He said he is arguing "on behalf of all parents". Comments on the online crowdfunding page include: "Thank you for being our voice Jon, we are all behind you." "Well done and good luck, let's hope common sense prevails." Mr Platt took his children to Disneyland in Florida in April despite his daughter's absence being refused by her primary school. The council took him to court after he refused to pay a Â£120 fine. He won his case after he told magistrates that Section 444 of the Education Act did not put restrictions on holidays during term time, provided pupils otherwise attended school regularly. The council has applied to the High Court for an opinion on whether "the unauthorised absence of a child for seven consecutive school days on holiday... amounts to the child failing to attend the school regularly".	A father is preparing for a High Court legal battle to give parents the right to take children on term-time holidays.
Brazil succeeded Philippe Montanier following the Frenchman's sacking on 14 January. The 54-year-old's only game in charge to date saw him oversee the 1-0 victory over Bristol City on Saturday. "I've been here five years. I love the football club and will do whatever they ask me to do," Brazil said. Despite the win over the Robins, Forest are 19th in Championship table and just five points above the relegation zone. Brazil added: "At this moment in time, I'm not aware of where the club is in terms of looking for a new manager. "From our point of view, we're very focused on making sure we do our jobs properly. You can tell when a group of players are on board with you, and they're on board with us. "I've been speaking to the owner about a number of things, and from my point of view he's been very supportive. We're trying very hard to bring some players in, and I'm getting very well supported by the chairman with that." Ben Osborn, who scored the winner against Bristol City, said: "It feels like a new manager has come in and taken over."	Interim boss Gary Brazil says he would take any role at Nottingham Forest and has not ruled out accepting the manager's job on a longer-term basis.
The Scottish government said the review group would assess whether college and university students in Scotland receive fair and effective support. Ms Gadhia, who has been chief executive officer of Virgin Money for nine years, will also make recommendations for improvements. The group will report its findings in 12 months' time. The review group will look at whether effective support is being provided for the poorest and most vulnerable students. It will also examine the current repayment threshold and period for student loan debt. It is being carried out as part of the programme for government announced by Nicola Sturgeon in September. Minister for Further Education Shirley-Anne Somerville said: "With such strong financial experience, and already contributing to Scottish education as a member of the International Council of Education Advisers, Jayne-Anne will provide a fresh perspective to the work of the review. "I look forward to the recommendations that the review group will offer." Ms Gadhia, who last year led a UK government review into women in finance, said: "It is important to ensure the student support system is fit for purpose, fair and firmly focused on meeting the needs of all students in further and higher education, particularly the most vulnerable. "As such, I welcome the opportunity to undertake a comprehensive review of the current systems of student support in Scotland." The review, which will be carried out jointly with universities and colleges, has been welcomed by Colleges Scotland. Shona Struthers, the chief executive of Colleges Scotland, said: "We want a standard and fair system for student support funding that provides students with adequate financial support, as well as reasonable certainty on the support they are likely to receive for the duration of their study. "We fully support measures to improve student support funding to ensure that all students can attend college, regardless of their personal circumstances or background." The announcement was made as figures from the Student Awards Agency Scotland (SAAS) showed the number of students being paid grants across Scotland fell by 4.8% on last year as an increasing number take out loans. However, the total cost being spent on grants increased by 3.9% - from £63.6m in 2014-2015 to £66.1m in 2015-2016, according to the SAAS report. The number of students taking out loans rose during the same period by 3.4% to 92,005 and the total authorised in loans was £486.3m, a 3.7% increase. The average loan per student in 2015/16 was £5,290, up £20 on the previous year. Scottish Conservative education spokeswoman Liz Smith said: "These are hugely worrying figures, and show that the SNP has slashed bursary support in recent years. "At a time when we should be doing all we can to close Scotland's attainment gap, the SNP has chosen to cut the money given to those who need it most. "Bursaries are designed to help students get their foot in the door but this is becoming increasingly hard, and it's those in our poorest communities who are missing out." Scottish Labour education spokesman Iain Gray said: "Figures released today show that almost 20,000 fewer students are receiving grants and bursaries than at the beginning of the last parliament. "Meanwhile student debt - which the SNP came to power promising to abolish - has soared under the SNP government. "Labour supports free tuition but students need the financial support to get through university when they get there. Instead the SNP has slashed bursaries and ballooned debt."	Virgin Money boss Jayne-Anne Gadhia has been appointed to review the student support system in Scotland.
Aaron Saucedo, 23, had already been charged with murder in connection with a killing in August 2015, police say. Now he has been linked to the deaths of eight other people, between January and July 2016. Police say they have not identified a motive but believe he acted alone. His lawyer has not commented. The 2015 victim was a 61-year-old man who had dated the suspect's mother, Phoenix Police Chief Jeri Williams said. The other victims, including a 12-year-old girl and a 55-year-old woman, seem to have been targeted at random. "Today is a good day in the city of Phoenix," Mayor Greg Stanton said. Police gave few details on how they linked the man to the killings, which stopped last July amid extensive media coverage. But they said the evidence included surveillance video, witness statements and ballistics material. He faces 26 additional felony counts, including multiple counts of homicide, aggravated assault and drive-by shootings. The Maricopa County attorney has not yet decided which charges to formally bring against him.	Police in the US state of Arizona say a man arrested last month is responsible for a series of deadly shootings in Phoenix last year.
The rig ran aground off Lewis during a storm on Monday while being transported to Malta. Sightseers have been warned to stay away from the scene of the grounding, and a 300m temporary exclusion zone has been put in place around Dalmore beach. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency said it was necessary to keep roads clear. The rig, which is carrying 280 tonnes of diesel oil, broke free from its tug during towing and severe weather prevented the line being reconnected. A salvage team began an inspection of the structure on Tuesday in preparation for the more detailed assessment. Hugh Shaw, the Secretary of State's Representative for Maritime Salvage and Intervention, said the initial survey was to check "a number of things including fuel tanks". Officials said the aim was to carry-out as much work as possible on Wednesday while the weather was favourable, but warned that work to refloat the rig could take some time. Mark Rodaway, of the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, said it was necessary to keep roads clear for emergency crews and salvage teams. He said: "We understand that this incident is of interest to people living in the area but we're asking them to stay away to ensure easy access for emergency services and salvage teams. "Also the last thing we want is for people to be injured or worse trying to get a closer look on remote cliff paths." Three vessels including the emergency towing vessel Herakles are the scene of the grounding. Union Bear, a multipurpose offshore vessel, has also arrived at Stornoway Harbour from Aberdeen to assist in the salvage operation. There were no personnel aboard the 17,000-tonne drilling rig when it became detached from the tug in the early hours of Monday, 8 August. The semi-submersible platform was being towed from Norway to Malta from where,  it is understood. it was to be taken to Turkey to be scrapped. The Marine Accident Investigation Branch has begun an inquiry into what happened	Salvage teams working at the Transocean Winner oil rig are expected to carry out a detailed inspection later on Wednesday.
Speaking to the BBC at the Paris Airshow, Mr Bregier said the aircraft manufacturer was committed to its 16,000 employees based in the UK. He added Airbus had no plans to relocate its British factories. Airbus has said in the past that a "Brexit" might change its plans. Last month, Airbus UK's chief executive, Paul Kahn, said that if the UK voted to leave the EU in the planned in-out referendum, Airbus would reconsider future investment in the UK. On Tuesday, Mr Bregier admitted he would have to make a judgement about what the consequences would be for the competitiveness of his business following the referendum. His comments come as ministers tabled an amendment to the EU referendum bill on Monday evening, ruling out holding the plebiscite on 5 May 2016, the same day as Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish assembly elections and local elections. It means the referendum is unlikely to take place before the autumn of 2016, depending on the prime minister's ability to negotiate concessions from his European counterparts and despite calls for the UK to get the vote over with. Businesses have repeated raised concerns about the level of uncertainty caused by the timing of the referendum and the potential economic harm caused as investment decisions are delayed as a result. Last month, Mr Kahn said the UK must compete for international investment. "The best way to guarantee this is by remaining part of the EU," he said. "I believe that it is vital for a company such as Airbus to come out and make a stand in favour of Britain remaining in the European Union." Airbus, the world's second-largest aircraft manufacturer after Boeing, employs 6,000 people at its site at Broughton, north Wales, where it assembles the wings for all Airbus aircraft. Several thousand more people are employed at Filton, near Bristol, designing wings and testing landing gear. Mr Kahn stressed that if the UK were to leave the EU, the company would not suddenly close. But he added: "If after an exit from the European Union, economic conditions in Britain were less favourable for business than in other parts of Europe, or beyond, would Airbus reconsider future investment in the United Kingdom? Yes, absolutely." Airbus is one of Europe's biggest industrial enterprises spanning civil aviation, defence and space, with operations in Germany, France and Spain. In the event of a British exit from the EU, Mr Kahn suggested the company could face more red tape in areas such as work visas and trade barriers. He said he was not "blindly supporting Britain's membership of the EU", adding: "I welcome the UK government's intentions to deliver positive and hoped-for reforms - which would create a leaner and more efficient EU."	Airbus chief executive Fabrice Bregier has said he has "no intention" of pulling manufacturing out of the UK if the country votes to leave the European Union (EU).
Sophia, as she called herself, charged $5 (Â£3.50) a week to be in a relationship with me on Facebook. She'd leave messages, laugh at my hilarious status updates and, most important of all, change her relationship status to say we were an item. As an experiment, I tried to see if my friends would be duped by this arrangement, one which I could describe only as a form of escorting - although strictly online only. After a long week, I came clean to both my friends and Sophia. I told them it was all a joke, and I nervously told her I was a journalist. Thankfully, she was up for a chat. "The whole Sophia thing is just my marketing username," she said. "Nothing on that Facebook profile is real. My photos on there are really me, but nothing else is." She said she was doing it to save money so she could go away and study. But that was 2013, and this is now. Has fake girlfriend tech moved on? While browsing Product Hunt, a great site that highlights new apps and ideas, I recently spotted an intriguing service called Invisible Girlfriend. It promised me the chance to sign up and create my perfect girlfriend, and soon I'd start getting text messages from her so I could impress all of my friends. "My cofounder had the idea for years," said Kyle Tabor, the site's chief executive, in an email. "He mainly needed a fake girlfriend to get his parents off his back after he was divorced." It works like this. You pick from one of six broad personality types - because there are only six types of women in the world, you understand. Rejecting "saucy and sarcastic" I went with "lovingly nerdy". Faced with a stock photo library of about 30 people, I picked out a picture of a pretty brunette. I should, apparently, save it to my phone to show my friends later. After a selecting a few standard interests - "lower league English football" wasn't available - I was then given help concocting a convincing back story. We met at an office party, and she's the girl of my dreams. Her name? That was left to a name generator. Mum, Dad... meet Alma Doris Brakus. I guessed I'd have to get used to it. Time to get down to some serious pro-flirting via text. Feel free to take notes. "Hi Alma, what are you up to?" I offered, sultrily. A few minutes later, she replied: "Not much, early day at work so I'm home already. What about you?" Bored already? Me too. But that's what makes this service more interesting than I'd first assumed. I thought this would essentially be a sex line. So if I said: "What are you up to?", the answer would be an attempt at sexiness, like: "Ooh, I'm all alone ;);)" and so forth. Yet the service seems to strive to be somewhat unsexy, almost mundane - like real life. I half expected her to ask me to pick up some milk on the way home. That authenticity is helped by the fact that the texts are written by real people, a team of "real anonymous humans" replying to every message. My cagey attempts to inject a bit of rudeness fell flat. The raunchiest exchange being: "What's the sexiest thing you could wear?" met with: "My skin lol. Or a skirt". "Can you send me a pic of yourself?" I asked, only to get "O->-<" in return. That's an emoticon of a person lying down, in case you can't tell. I'd have pushed it further, but the thought of some "real anonymous" bloke texting me back made me feel strange. To sum up: a ludicrous, pathetic idea, that no-one would possibly take seriously. Or so I thought. "We have had thousands of users pay for the service," Mr Tabor told me. "It's about 50/50 between the text only and the full suite." You read that right. People pay for this (according to Mr Tabor at least). If you just want text messages, it costs $15 a month. The full suite is $25, and you get voicemails and all sorts for that. The service isn't just for fake girlfriends, either. The site also lets women, or gay men, sign up and have a fake boyfriend. And what Mr Tabor said next surprised me the most. "Actually, over 60% of our accounts choose boyfriends." Consider me baffled. Why would anyone want or need this? "Several reasons," Mr Tabor said. "Get parents off your back, get a co-worker to stop hitting on you, make an ex jealous, or maybe just to practice flirting." His team takes the illusion responsibility seriously. I wanted to use the image of my beloved Alma Doris in this article, but Mr Tabor politely asked that I didn't, on the off-chance it might blow someone else's cover story. An extensive how-to guide contains tips such as how to talk about your girlfriend/boyfriend, what questions to expect from pushy friends, and common mistakes people make when lying through their teeth about an imaginary human. There's even a live chat function to ask for advice from the site's staff. But in the end, I had to break up with Alma Doris. "I'm moving to Yemen," I said. She didn't understand. If this service seems sad to you, then don't laugh. Just be thankful. Many users, Mr Tabor said, used the service for companionship. Someone to text for a chat now and then. Like Sophia in 2013, Invisible Girlfriend and Boyfriend is satisfying a need, and a harmless one at that. If people are prepared to pay for a service, and others are prepared to provide it - then fine. And for the record, the woman behind Sophia did go on to save enough to study. Late last year, she certified as a fully qualified dietician. Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC and on Facebook	Three years ago, I hired a fake girlfriend.
Johnson made his film debut in the 1950s and featured in numerous films, alongside stars such as Frank Sinatra, Laurence Olivier and Charlton Heston. A founder member of the Royal Shakespeare Company, Johnson played several lead roles including Romeo and Mark Anthony in Julius Caesar. He also appeared in several TV dramas such as Lewis and Silent Witness. Johnson died after a short illness at the Royal Marsden Hospital in Chelsea, London. He is survived by his wife Lynne, who he married in 2004, and his four children. Johnson was born in Upminster, Essex, and he left his training at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) to join Sir John Gielgud's company. He joined the Royal Navy during World War Two and then made his film debut in 1959, when he appeared in the MGM film Never So Few, starring Frank Sinatra and Gina Lollobrigida. He also appeared in The Haunting (1963) and Khartoum (1966), opposite Laurence Olivier and Charlton Heston. His family said he was offered and turned down the role of James Bond after playing British spy Bulldog Drummond in Deadlier Than the Male (1967) and its sequel Some Girls Do (1969). His most recent film credits include The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas (2008) and Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001).	British actor Richard Johnson, whose career spanned film, theatre and TV, has died aged 87, his family has said.
Industry magazine What Car? says prices of VW models have not collapsed as might have been expected. VW cars which are three years old, or have done 36,000 miles, are typically worth 42.21% of their original value, the magazine said. That is 2.7% lower than in September 2015, just before the scandal broke. However, across the industry as a whole, second hand values have fallen by 2% over the same timeframe, suggesting that Volkswagens have performed only slightly worse than the average car on the market. "I'm sure there are motorists out there who were rubbing their hands in glee at the thought of used VW prices falling off a cliff because of the emissions debacle," said What Car? editor Steve Huntingford. "That simply hasn't come to pass, however, and while the VW story continues to rumble on a year after the story first came to light, the Golf and Polo are still among the most popular new cars in the UK." The German car-maker admitted on 16 September last year that software had switched diesel engines to a "clean mode" whenever they were tested for emissions. VW has recalled 200,000 cars in the UK as a result. But while it is offering to repair them, it is not offering owners compensation. VW drivers in the US have been offered up to $10,000 each to make up for the deception. The What Car? research suggested that cars made by VW under the Audi brand experienced a similar drop in value to VW-badged cars over the past year. It also found that the value of second hand Seat and Skoda models, also made by the VW group, fell by less than 0.5% over the 12-month period.	Second hand Volkswagens appear to be holding their value well, a motoring magazine says, despite the emissions scandal which emerged a year ago.
Media playback is not supported on this device Five goals were scored in the first half, with Greg Stewart and Kane Hemmings striking early for Dundee. Ross County captain Andrew Davies headed in from a corner before Rory Loy diverted home Hemmings' shot. Alex Schalk netted on half-time, but Craig Wighton and Stewart with a fine solo goal made the points safe late on. After seven minutes Stewart drove through the heart of the County defence before turning the ball onto his favoured left foot and curling it into the bottom corner. Two minutes later Hemmings took full advantage of slackness in the Staggies defence and knocked home his 23rd goal of the campaign. It was no more than Paul Hartley's side deserved after a whirlwind start. Jim McIntyre's team eventually woke up and reduced the deficit after a succession of corners. Davies ghosted in at the front post and with a glancing header knocked the ball beyond David Mitchell to give the travelling fans hope of retaining their place in the top half of the table. And they should have been back on level terms when Michael Gardyne's cross was met on the volley by Martin Woods but the midfielder hammered the ball over the crossbar. Dundee however restored their two-goal advantage as once again the visitors defence was breached. Hemmings had a shot on goal that was glanced into the top corner by Loy giving Gary Woods no chance in the County goal. The first-half action though was far from over. Schalk latched onto a long through-ball and although Dens keeper Mitchell got his hand to the shot there was enough The second half failed to live up to the opening period but there were still plenty of chances created at both ends. Gardyne blasted high over the crossbar from 12 yards out while Ian McShane saved on the line from Dundee top scorer Hemmings as the home side looked for goal number four. County survived a scare when Hemmings managed to get a touch on the end of a Stewart free-kick but the ball trickled only a few inches the wrong side of the post. The home side secured all three points with four minutes left when Wighton hammered the ball home after Stewart's shot was blocked. Stewart completed the scoring when he once again fired home with a cultured left-foot shot that beat Woods. Hartley's side are now in pole position to secure a place in the top six for the season run-in.	Dundee leapfrogged Ross County and moved into the Premiership's top six, prevailing in a hugely entertaining Dens Park encounter.
The pastor and his family eventually fled Chibok in September after repeated attacks by the militants. They moved to the nearby town of Mubi until it also came under attack the next month and now live in Minna in the north-west. The family now scrapes a living by selling firewood and as Rev Mark tells the BBC's Chris Ewokor, the 12 months since the abductions have felt like "like 10 years". Since the abduction of Monica and Sarah we've been in some kind of condition but I cannot describe it. We are not able to sleep. My wife [has been having] this problem with her blood pressure, we have been struggling, at times when I come and see her alone I meet her crying, at times she cannot eat especially when it was in the early days just after these girls were abducted. We set a day that we fast and pray so that the Lord will strengthen our daughters and all the abducted Chibok girls, if they are still alive. My biological daughter Monica, she was 20 at that time she was abducted, and Sarah Samuel [my adopted daughter] was 18. That day, 14 April, was a very dangerous day. I remember hearing gunshots - all the buildings in Chibok were shaking. We have little mountains there and they were was echoing the shooting sound. When we went to the bush, I asked them [my wife and small children] to continue walking but I watched what was going and and saw how they were setting fire on some buildings until the morning. I managed to get back to my house and took my machine [motorbike]. I went to the school, no pupils were there. I asked about them and was told that they have taken our daughters, and they showed me the direction they went. We saw that the girls had dropped their head scarves and dropped shoes along the way. So I used that as a guide to follow where they went. Somebody told me that my daughter jumped out of the vehicle and she was wounded and she could not walk. It encouraged me to continue to pursue them. I went to a village which the kidnappers had set fire to and passed through it. I went to the next village and was told that the kidnappers had somebody and that should go back. I just went into the bush to keep on looking and I met two girls - Sarah Lawan and a daughter of my watchman. I took them on my machine to the house. They [had] jumped out of the big lorry that was carrying them - if you would have seen the dust on them, you would have pitied them. So it was those girls who gave me the information that they were kidnapped. When I was in Chibok, there were some members of Boko Haram who mixed with us, so we did get some information though it was not first hand and we did not know if it was true or not. I was told that my daughter was stoned to death soon after being kidnapped and I was told that my daughter had been asked her to receive the Prophet Muhammad as her saviour. She refused [and] I was told that they dug a hole and buried her leaving her head outside and stoned her to death. But [an envoy of the government who has been negotiating with the Boko Haram] just some three weeks ago he called me and told me that my daughters' names  are among the names of the girls they are expecting [to be freed] which shows she is still alive, according to what he told me. I have hope. Even if my daughter has been stoned to death, I am the happiest man as a man of God who has brought up my daughter with that kind of faith. I always think that had it been President Goodluck [Jonathan], or the defence minister or the chief defence minister or the governor of Borno state or those senators, who had lost a daughter, how would they feel? At the time these girls were kidnapped, had the federal government paid careful attention they would have rescued these girls. I'm not blaming the federal government but it's their responsibility to bring the girls back. When I remember the future of my [other] children it makes me to shed tears, I don't know how we will end up. Since the kidnapping none of my children has been to school. Monica, she's very neat in everything and she's prayerful all the time. And one thing that makes me to remember her all the time, [she said] "Daddy I'm praying for you that you will be able to sponsor me, I want to be a doctor I want to help the nation." That's all these things that I remember -  and her determination.	The daughter and adopted daughter of Reverend Enoch Mark were amongst the more than 200 girls kidnapped in the early hours of the morning from their boarding school by Boko Haram militants in northern-eastern Nigeria a year ago.
Police initially said that business rivalry was a more likely motive for the attack on the Movida bar restaurant outside Kuala Lumpur on 28 June. They added that two men suspected of involvement had been arrested. Authorities are increasingly concerned about IS-related attacks as a number of Malaysians have gone to fight in Syria. "There were elements of IS involvement in the attack," national police chief Khalid Abu Bakar told reporters. "We found out that the two of them received instructions from one of our own citizens in Syria... to conduct attacks in Malaysia." There have been dozens of extremism-related arrests in recent years, including 13 Malaysians detained following the latest attack but who police said were not directly connected to it. Governments across the region have warned of an increased threat from the group.	Malaysian police have said a blast at a bar last week, which injured eight, was the first attack by the so-called Islamic State group in the country.
The Hammers were last week accused of sex discrimination by Stephen Hunt, chairman of the ladies' club. West Ham said they will now work in unison with the ladies' team to ensure key improvements are made. Vice-chairman Karren Brady said the Premier League club are "passionately committed to equality". She added women's football was a "high priority on our agenda". Hunt had told BBC Sport West Ham should "start to act like a 21st century club" and claimed they had stopped his team from finding sponsors, adding the ladies were short on funds because they had to buy their own kit. In response, West Ham claimed Hunt had "refused to align" with their principles. The ladies' team, who this season celebrate their 25th anniversary, play in the FA Women's Premier League Southern Division. Brady added: "The addition of the ladies into the West Ham family is the solution my board and I have long sought. "Not only does it secure the long-term future of the ladies' side, but also guarantees current and future supporters, players and staff of the ladies' team will form an integral part of the club's bright future as we move forward." As part of the agreement, the West Ham Ladies' Academy will also be managed by the Premier League club.	West Ham United have taken over the running of the ladies' club, saying they are "delighted" to bring it into "the West Ham family".
Are those voices being heard when it comes to the election? Courses to help young people get into work are held at the Spectrum Centre on the Shankill Road in Belfast. Among them is 18-year-old Donna Rennie who said she would "love to get a job". "I've applied for loads but it doesn't work, there's always somebody better," she said. "It's not a nice feeling." It's a feeling Marc Young knows only too well. "I went to school, got my GCSEs and A-levels and I thought I would walk into a job but I haven't," he added. "I've applied everywhere and just haven't heard back which is really frustrating." So what is the answer? What should the politicians be doing? William Glass has been in and out of jobs for the past two years since leaving school at 16. "Why not spend the time, the four years in school, training for a job or career that you want to be in? "Then more people are going to have the skills they need for the job. "I want a career, I don't want to be going from job to job." Thomas McKeown is looking for a job in youth work and he feels frustrated when he watches what happens at Stormont. "I feel the politicians today are just so bitter-minded about wanting to get one up on each other," he said. "How long do we actually want this to go on? It's been going on long enough." William agrees: "I believe there are people in Stormont who are stuck in the past and fighting. "For me, that era is truly over. "I want to see people using legal highs to get help and I want to see drug reform and better health care." And Dylan Bell believes the politicians need to be more visible when it isn't election time. "You see the politicians round your door every day for a month and a half," he said. "Then the rest of the ten and a half months you see them on the news and that's it - they're more worried about being on the big screen."	Almost one in five young people are unemployed in Northern Ireland, according to latest figures.
Hitachi is to buy Horizon Nuclear Power, which was intending to build reactors on existing sites at Wylfa, Anglesey, and Oldbury, near Bristol. Hitachi is buying Horizon from Germany's E.On and RWE, which are withdrawing from the UK nuclear market. Prime Minister David Cameron said it was a major step for the UK. "This is a decades-long, multi-billion pound vote of confidence in the UK, that will contribute vital new infrastructure to power our economy. "It will support up to 12,000 jobs during construction and thousands more permanent highly skilled roles once the new power plants are operational, as well as stimulating exciting new industrial investments in the UK's nuclear supply chain. I warmly welcome Hitachi as a major new player in the UK energy sector," he said. By Jorn MadslienBusiness reporter, BBC News Hitachi's acquisition of Horizon Nuclear Power marks the start of a journey. The Japanese company says it wants to invest billions of pounds and create thousands of jobs in the UK, as it helps combat predicted energy shortages in the years ahead. But no firm investment commitment will be forthcoming until the government comes up with a minimum price for nuclear power. And if that price turns out to be too low, there is no guarantee that Hitachi will go ahead with its plans. Nuclear deal still faces hurdles UK engineering companies Babcock International and Rolls-Royce have signed preliminary contracts to join the Hitachi deal, which the Japanese company said should be completed by the end of November. There will then be regulatory issues to clear, but once Hitachi's reactor design is approved by the necessary authorities the company intends to build 6 gigawatts of nuclear capacity, with the first plant generating power in the first half of the next decade. Up to 6,000 jobs are expected to be created during construction at each site, thousands more in the supply chain, and a further 1,000 permanent jobs at both locations once operational. The Horizon venture, based at Brockworth, Gloucester, currently employs about 90 people and was set up in 2009 as part of the drive to meet the UK's carbon reduction goals and secure energy demand as old power plants are decommissioned. But RWE and E.On put the business up for sale in March after Germany's move to abandon nuclear power in the wake of Japan's Fukushima disaster. A consortium made up of EDF and British Gas-owner Centrica has maintained its interest but the two companies have still to decide whether to build two reactors at Hinckley Point, Somerset. Companies involved in the nuclear industry have expressed caution over entering the UK market. Because of the huge capital costs, stretched over many years, companies want some certainty over how much they might be paid for the electricity generated by their plants. Last week, the chief executive of EDF, Vincent de Rivaz, told MPs that his company needed safeguards from the government that the finances of future nuclear deals would be "fair". Delays over decision-making and financing have led to doubts that new power capacity will come on stream before existing plants go offline. A so-called "energy gap" is likely to lead to rising prices and a greater dependency on gas imports. Earlier this month, the energy regulator Ofgem warned that the UK risks running out of energy generating capacity in the winter of 2015-16. Its report predicted that the amount of spare capacity could fall from 14% now to only 4% in three years. However, the government said that its forthcoming Energy Bill would ensure that there was secure supply. With so many uncertainties still to be resolved, investment in the UK nuclear sector was still a "leap of faith", said George Borovas, head of nuclear projects at global law firm Pillsbury. So, he said, Hitachi's decision was a "significant... vote of confidence in the UK nuclear programme". Hitachi's proposed facilities will use its advanced boiling water technology, which is already used in four reactors in Japan. Mr Borovas said this technology was a "proven success", adding: "This should be very helpful with respect to its licensing in the UK and also opens up the possibility of significant export credit agency and commercial financing from Japan." Energy and Climate Change Secretary Ed Davey said: "Hitachi bring with them decades of expertise, and are responsible for building some of the most advanced nuclear reactors on time and on budget, so I welcome their commitment to helping build a low-carbon, secure-energy future for the UK." Shadow energy secretary Caroline Flint called on the government to use this as an opportunity to encourage investment in nuclear research and design. Unions also welcomed Hitachi's move, with Mike Clancy, general secretary designate of Prospect, saying: "The Horizon venture is an important milestone in securing future low-carbon energy generation capacity within the UK and its importance to local and national economies cannot be overstated. "While Hitachi's advanced boiling water reactor design has yet to undergo the UK's generic design assessment approval process, it is a proven technology and therefore any construction in the UK will benefit from lessons learned from its construction in Japan."	The UK's nuclear expansion plans have been boosted after Japan's Hitachi signed a Â£700m deal giving it rights to build a new generation of power plants.
The vehicles, which were travelling in the same direction, collided on Red Hill Way, Leicester, at 21:17 BST on Tuesday. Police said the 19-year-old on one of the bikes was killed. A 29-year-old man was arrested and remains in police custody. Officers have asked anyone with information about the collision to get in touch.	A man has been arrested after a fatal road crash involving two motorbikes.
Clapham said his position had become "untenable" following criticism in the media and on social media. The decision followed on from the news that three directors, including Shrouder, would step aside in June. Director Nigel Allen will take on the chairmanship on an interim basis while new investors are sought. Clapham added: "(Directors) Nigel Allen and Liam Watson are considering their positions, Nigel has agreed to act as Interim Chairman until the 30 June 2017 during which time the board will seek a meeting with the Trust in Yellow Board to establish their views for the future as the call for change has come from them following the Open Meeting. "The board will urgently seek to establish any level of interest in bringing in investors who may wish to take a controlling interest in the ownership of the club." After their relegation from the National League was confirmed following defeat by Dover Athletic, Southport beat promotion-chasing Forest Green Rovers - only their third win of 2017.	Southport chairman Charlie Clapham has stood down with immediate effect, along with vice-chairman Sam Shrouder following National League relegation.
Edmund backed up two wins in qualifying with a 6-3 6-2 victory over world number 73 Garcia-Lopez in Beijing. The 21-year-old from Yorkshire, ranked 54th, goes on to face another Spaniard, Roberto Bautista Agut, who beat John Millman 6-4 3-6 6-3. Fellow Britons Andy Murray and Johanna Konta are in action on Tuesday. Second seed Murray will play Italian Andreas Seppi in his opening match, while Konta takes on Hungary's Timea Babos as the British number one looks to maintain her hopes of a place at the season-ending WTA Finals. American Madison keys, currently three places ahead of Konta in the eighth and final qualifying position, beat Kristina Mladenovic of France 7-5 6-4 on Monday. There was an upset as China's unseeded Shuai Peng beat American sixth seed Venus Williams 7-5 6-1.	Britain's Kyle Edmund is through to the second round of the China Open following a straight-sets win over Spain's Guillermo Garcia-Lopez.
The flag was raised beside Stormont House on Friday morning to mark Belfast's Pride festival on Saturday. Northern Ireland Secretary James Brokenshire approved the flying of the flag. The move comes amid the continued deadlock over Northern Ireland's ban on same-sex marriage. It also coincides with the first official visit of Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar to Northern Ireland. Mr Varadkar is the Republic of Ireland's first openly gay taoiseach and will attend a pride festival breakfast event on Saturday morning. Thousands of people are expected to take part in the main Belfast Pride parade on Saturday afternoon. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK where same-sex marriage is still banned. The issue is one of the major stumbling blocks in the ongoing Stormont crisis, with Sinn Féin demanding that the DUP stop blocking a law change. Before the Northern Ireland Executive collapsed in January, the DUP had used a Stormont veto known as a petition of concern to block motions to change the law on same-sex marriage. The party has rejected accusations that it is homophobic and said that it is protecting the "traditional" definition of marriage between a man and a woman. Stormont House is Mr Brokenshire's base within the grounds of the wider Stormont estate. He said that while same-sex marriage was a matter for devolved government at Stormont, he hoped that the law would change. "I voted for equal marriage in England and Wales and, like the prime minister, hope this can be extended to Northern Ireland in the future," he said.	A rainbow gay pride flag has flown at a Stormont government building for the first time.
The package will offer concessional loans at interest rates pegged at 3.2%. Agriculture Minister Barnaby Joyce said some farmers in Queensland had not earned any income for three years because of drought. Much of Australia has received lower than usual amounts of rain this year, while the country has just experienced its hottest spring on record. "Large parts of Queensland and parts of New South Wales are experiencing the worst dry conditions on record, with rainfall at historical lows in many areas," Mr Joyce said. In the past, the government has provided billions of dollars' worth of drought assistance to farmers. The National Farmers' Federation (NFF) had called on the government to strengthen drought assistance measures that were announced earlier this year. NFF President Brent Finlay said farmers needed lower interest loans with longer terms of repayment, less paperwork to receive government allowances and additional funding for water infrastructure and pest control. "These measures will not only assist farmers while in drought, but will help them recover and quickly ramp up production when the rains do come," said Mr Finlay.	Farmers may soon receive as much as A$100m (£53m) in drought assistance from the Australian government.
Riot police quelled skirmishes between rival fans behind one of the goals just before kick-off in England's 3-0 win. An English FA statement said the incidents had not taken place in the area where fans who bought tickets from the FA were located. The cases will be dealt with on Thursday, 22 October. "We would encourage the authorities to identify anybody involved in disorder and deal with them appropriately through the criminal system and with banning orders," the English FA said. "We will, of course, fully cooperate with Uefa." When fighting broke out, local police quickly intervened to form a barrier between fans to prevent the violence escalating. Some England fans appeared to have purchased tickets for sections of the ground designated for home supporters. Lithuania's FA has also been charged by European football's governing body over breaches of ticketing rules and for having blocked stairways. BBC Radio 5 live reporter Alan Green reported he had seen missiles being thrown by fans. And BBC Sport's chief football writer Phil McNulty added there had been "a few brief skirmishes between rival fans at one end of this tiny stadium where some England fans have posted themselves near Lithuania supporters". England won 3-0 with goals from Ross Barkley and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, either side of an own goal from Lithuania keeper Giedrius Arlauskis. The victory meant Roy Hodgson's side won all 10 of their qualifying matches for next summer's European Championship in France.	Uefa has charged the English and Lithuanian Football Associations over crowd disturbances at their Euro 2016 qualifier in Vilnius on Monday.
The authors, including a team from Edinburgh University, say children born to overweight mothers are at greater risk of health problems in later life. They say every pregnant woman should have access to dieticians and psychologists to help protect the health of their future children. During the three-year project several pieces of research were consulted. In one of the most extensive studies to question whether the health of mothers-to-be can have long-term consequences on their offspring, scientists pulled together several pieces of research across Europe. One key study, involving 13,000 individuals, revealed that babies born to overweight mothers are more likely to suffer heart disease or strokes or develop type 2 diabetes in later life. Another analysis from Edinburgh University found that obese women eat a diet richer in saturated fats and poorer in vitamins and minerals during their pregnancy compared to slim women. In early work, including animal studies, scientists found the placenta of females who ate a high fat diet offered less protection to the foetus from the stress hormone, cortisol. Offspring were more likely to be small and to suffer mood disorders in later life. Overall project leader Dr Patricia Iozzo, from the National Research Council, Pisa, Italy, said: "Attention needs to be devoted to the prevention of obesity and becoming overweight among young girls, representing tomorrow's mothers." Dr Iozzo says the period at the end of pregnancy is particularly important. Her work suggests babies' metabolic health - including the fats and sugars in their blood - may be worse if mothers put on unhealthy amounts of weight at this time. "I feel the message is a positive one. Mothers can do a lot during pregnancy to look after the future health of their children. "They must under no circumstances stop eating though. They should ensure they have a balanced diet and make sure they are physically active. "And I think every mother should have access to a team of health workers during pregnancy - including not just midwives and obstetricians but psychologists and dietitians too." Louise Silverton, director for midwifery at the Royal College of Midwives, said:"Women should try to be an ideal weight before they become pregnant and, if not, should follow midwifery advice to manage their weight while eating a good diet rich in micronutrients. "After birth, women need support to develop healthy patterns of eating and exercise. "For women who are overweight or obese they need support to access weight-loss services to ensure that they are an ideal weight before they embark on their next pregnancy. The ongoing Dorian project is funded by the European Commission.	A major European obesity investigation has called for urgent action to prevent obesity in women of child-bearing age.
The 27-year-old has made 73 appearances for Blues since joining in 2013 but spent the past 18 months out on loan. Last season, the once-capped Scotland international helped Hibernian win promotion to the Scottish Premiership, scoring three goals in 32 games. "To get him for Luton is a real coup for the football club," Hatters boss Nathan Jones told the club website. "We lost a wonderful player in Cameron McGeehan [to Barnsley] and what he does is difficult to replace, but we have brought in a different Championship-quality player and we are delighted."

Victoria Street in Victoria flooded at about 18:00 BST on Saturday and the water gushed into several businesses including the Curzon Cinema, which had to be evacuated. Fire crews then helped some people in the venue cross the flooded pavement. Thames Water said a large pipe burst damaging the road but no customers were without water on Sunday. A spokesman for the company said: "Our team is on site arranging emergency repairs. "We apologise for any inconvenience caused and we will fix the pipe as soon as possible." The road remained closed between Palace Street and Buckingham Gate on Sunday morning and several buses in the busy area were on diversion. On its website Curzon Cinemas Victoria said: "Due to a burst water main, Curzon Victoria has had to close tonight (Saturday 6th June). "We apologise for any inconvenience caused."	Cinema-goers were carried to safety by firefighters after they became stranded when a water main burst in London.
His first spell at the club saw him win the Premier League twice, the FA Cup, the League Cup twice and the Community Shield. He was one of the most colourful characters in the British game and has since enjoyed success at Inter Milan and Real Madrid before returning to London. BBC Sport looks at some of Mourinho's best quotes and controversies. On becoming Chelsea manager for the first time: "I have top players and I'm sorry, we have a top manager. Please do not call me arrogant because what I say is true. I'm European champion, I'm not one out of the bottle, I think I'm a special one." On bird flu: "I'm feeling a lot of pressure with the swan in Scotland. It's not far and I'm more scared of the swan than of football. What's football compared to life? A swan with bird flu, for me that's a drama." On drinking wine with then-Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson: "After the game, after the press conference, we were together in my office. The wine we were drinking was very bad and he was complaining. When we go to Old Trafford it's my birthday and I will go with a beautiful bottle of Portuguese wine." Media playback is not supported on this device On eggs: "Omelettes, eggs. No eggs, no omelettes. And it depends on the quality of the eggs in the supermarket. They are class one, two or three and some are more expensive than others and some give you better omelettes. When the class one eggs are not available you have a problem." On being sacked: "If the club decide to sack me because of bad results that's part of the game. If it happens I will be a millionaire and get another club a couple of months later." On Chelsea's pitch: "Sometimes you see beautiful people with no brains. Sometimes you have ugly people who are intelligent, like scientists. Our pitch is a bit like that. From the top it's a disgrace but the ball rolls at normal speed." On playing Chelsea, while manager of Real Madrid: "If I play them in the Champions League, I want to go there and kill them - that's my message," Then-Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez: "If Chelsea are naive and pure then I'm Little Red Riding Hood." Then-Sheffield United manager Neil Warnock: "My wife will be glad about Mourinho coming to Bramall Lane because he's a good looking swine, isn't he?" Career record up to 1 June 2013 Former Chelsea striker Eidur Gudjohnsen: "When Mourinho says training will last one-and-a-half hours it will never last a second longer." Then-Chelsea striker Didier Drogba's reaction to Mourinho leaving the London club: "I find Jose's 'eviction' hard to take. I could not see the blow coming so brutally. "It changes an awful lot of things. I am in the sort of nervous state I've never dreamed about before. Many of us used to play first and foremost for the manager. Now we need to forget those feelings and find another source of motivation." Ian Holloway on Mourinho's sacking by Chelsea: "Football has gone mad. He is one of the best managers in the world. I'm devastated. I was learning from him from afar. He makes you feel 25-foot tall and I'm going to sorely miss him." Barcelona vice-president Carles Vilarrubi on Mourinho's return to Chelsea: "It is not good for English football. If Mourinho behaves like he did in Spain it will only be an unhappy relationship. In his three years in Spain he only created disagreements and arguments. I am happy he is leaving and so is everyone in Spanish football." February 2005: After Chelsea's 2-1 defeat against Barcelona in the first leg of their last-16 clash, Mourinho wrongly accused Barcelona coach Frank Rijkaard of visiting referee Anders Frisk at half-time. Mourinho is fined £8,900, given a two-match touchline ban and called an "enemy of football" by the head of Uefa's referees committee Volker Roth. March 2005: Mourinho is fined £5,000 after he alleged Manchester United players were guilty of "fault and fault and cheat and cheat" during a Carling Cup semi-final clash. June 2005: Mourinho is fined £200,000, which is reduced to £75,000 on appeal, for meeting then-Arsenal player Ashley Cole, without his club's consent. January to March 2010: While manager of Inter Milan, Mourinho is fined three times in as many months by the Italian Football Federation. December 2010: Mourinho is banned for one Champions League match after being found guilty of improper conduct. It follows the dismissal of Real Madrid players Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos during a Champions League game against Ajax. August 2011: Mourinho, now in charge of Real Madrid, pokes Barcelona's then-assistant manager Tito Vilanova in the eye during touchline exchanges after a stormy Spanish Super Cup tie. January 2013: After dropping club captain Iker Casillas before the mid-winter break, reports emerge in the Spanish press of disagreements between Mourinho and some of his senior players. Stories continue to appear throughout the rest of the season about disharmony in the squad, with centre-back Pepe the latest to fall foul of Mourinho last month. May 2013: In a bad-tempered Copa del Rey final defeat by neighbours Atletico Madrid, Mourinho is sent from the bench for furiously protesting a decision from the referee. He was jeered by sections of the Real support during his final game in charge against Osasuna.	Jose Mourinho is back as manager of Chelsea after leaving Stamford Bridge in September 2007.
The preliminary figures show that operating profit will be 6.1tn won ($5.1bn; Â£3.5bn) for the October to December period, from 5.29tn won a year earlier. Analysts had expected the amount to be 6.6tn won, fuelling growth concerns. Samsung products have been hit by weak demand in China and currency woes. Operating profit fell 7.5% from the previous quarter. Sales at the world's biggest maker of memory chips and smartphones also missed forecasts at 53tn won for the period. Samsung does not break down its earnings results in the preliminary report, leaving analysts to speculate on how each business division is doing. But analysts predict that the latest forecast is a sign that the tech giant will face another tough year of weaker gadget sales as the smartphone market is saturated. Samsung is facing stiff competition at the top end of the market from Apple, while cheaper Chinese rivals are gaining ground in the mid to low level range for mobile devices. On Monday, chief executive Kwon Oh-hyun had warned that the firm faced challenges on weak global economic growth prospects. Final earnings results for the quarter are due to be released at the end of January.	Samsung Electronics says its operating profit is likely to rise 15% in the fourth quarter from a year ago, missing market expectations.
They say the arrests happened when protesters refused to leave land owned by the pipeline company. A spokesman said the latest arrests brought the number detained since August to almost 700. They came after the US Army was ordered to allow the construction of the final section of the Dakota Access Pipeline. Native Americans and their supporters have protested against the project for months, and have vowed to fight on. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe say the final section - under Lake Oahe, a reservoir on the Missouri River - would contaminate drinking water on their land and damage sacred burial sites. Morton County Sheriff's Office spokesman Rob Keller said the latest arrests were made after demonstrators moved from their existing camp on flood-prone ground to land owned by the pipeline company, Energy Transfer Partners. He said no injuries had been reported during the operation. Protest leaders could not be reached for comment. The $3.7bn (Â£2.8bn) pipeline is designed to transport about 470,000 barrels of crude oil a day across four states, from North Dakota to a terminal in Illinois, where it can be shipped to refineries. The US Army Corps of Engineers, which has approval authority, decided last year to explore other routes for the pipeline amid huge protests by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. But earlier this week, acting Secretary of the Army Robert Speer ordered the corps to allow the work to go ahead. President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order signalling his support for the pipeline.	Police in the US state of North Dakota say they have arrested 76 people protesting against a controversial oil pipeline.
Alves, 33, joined from Sevilla and won three Champions Leagues, six La Liga titles and four Copa del Rey trophies. The Catalan club's director Robert Fernandez said: "Dani Alves has decided to leave. It's a personal decision that the club have to accept." The Spanish champions also said they will exercise a buy-back option to sign Denis Suarez from Villarreal in July. Suarez, 22, joined Villarreal from Barcelona last summer and signed a four-year deal but Fernandez said they will now be "notified of his return". Alves signed a one-year deal at the club last summer and will leave a free agent at the end of a season in which Barca secured a league and cup double. His tally of 391 games is the second-highest for a foreign player at the club behind Lionel Messi. Alves, who netted 21 goals in his eight years at Barca, wrote a message for the clubs fans on Instagram when it was announced he would leave the club. The Brazilian said the club was home to "the greatest accomplishments of my professional career". "From the first day, from the first training session under Pep Guardiola until the last day of this past season, I have had the good luck to enjoy football with passion," wrote Alves. "I am a privileged, hard-working and honoured football player, for whom life has allowed me to wear the shirt of the best club in the world in a prodigious decade marked by the quality of the players and coaches. "I am going, but I will be back, because I am not just another player."	Brazil international full-back Dani Alves will leave Barcelona after eight years at the club.
The Giants got a short-handed opener through player-coach Derrick Walser but Jeff Dimmen pulled the Panthers level. In the second period Mike Forney's powerplay breakaway goal make it 2-1 with Andy Bohmback equalising. Mike Radja scored from an acute angle and James Desmarais made it 4-2 before Nottingham's David Ling got one back. The teams meet again on Saturday night in the second match of their double-header. Nottingham lead the league on 28 points, with Sheffield Steelers on 27 and Belfast 25.	The Belfast Giants shaded a 4-3 win over Nottingham Panthers on Friday night to close the gap on the Elite League leaders to three points.
They advocated positivity and harmony - expressed through the medium of funk. "From my youngest days, I always felt certain affinities with the idea of being a preacher," said bandleader Maurice White, who has died at the age of 74. "Being joyful and positive was the whole objective of our group. Our goal was to reach all the people and to keep a universal atmosphere. All of our songs had that positive energy. To create uplifting music was the objective." Blending jazz, Latin and soul with an infectious rhythmic pulse, Earth Wind & Fire they sold more than 90 million albums around the world. Several of their records went multi-platinum, and songs like September, Fantasy and After The Love Has Gone remain gold-plated disco classics. One of the 1970's most accomplished live acts, they regularly featured 16 players on stage, all of whom could turn on a dime. They even incorporated pyrotechnics, lighting effects and magic tricks (floating pianos, disappearing acts) into their set. A young Michael Jackson could often be found in the audience, taking notes. "We were playing highly sophisticated music, and we had to figure out a way to keep people's eyes on the stage," White recalled. "I figured if people were listening to something they hadn't heard before, we had to do exciting things." White's death robs the band not just of their founder member, but their driving force - a musician who steered the band through multiple line-up changes, and honed their sound for crossover appeal. Even when Parkinson's disease robbed him of the ability to play in the 1990s, White took care of the band's business affairs, and devotedly guarded their legacy. Announcing his death, White's brother and bandmate Verdine simply called him his "hero and best friend". Born in Memphis on 19 December 1941, Maurice White was the son of a doctor and grandson of a New Orleans honky-tonk pianist. He moved to Chicago with his family and sang gospel from a young age, but didn't learn to read music until he was 18, when he enrolled at the Chicago Conservatory of Music as a percussion scholar. Upon graduating, he earned his stripes as a session drummer at Chess Records, playing for Etta James, Muddy Waters and Fontella Bass, before leaving to join popular jazz group The Ramsey Lewis Trio, where he learned to play the Kalimba - an African thumb piano that later featured on several Earth Wind & Fire hits. "Ramsey helped shape my musical vision beyond just the music," White later recalled. "I learned about performance and staging." In 1969, he struck out on his own, forming a songwriting partnership with keyboardist Don Whitehead and singer Wade Flemons, which evolved into a band called the Salty Peppers. The group scored a local hit with the effervescent party track La La Time but when a follow-up flopped, he took his bandmates to Los Angeles, adding singer Sherry Scott to form the first version of Earth Wind & Fire, naming the group after the elements on his astrological chart. Critics found their first two albums intriguing but derivative - with many noting a heavy debt to Sly & The Family Stone. "What they lack, though, is Sly's sense of derision and irony," said Rolling Stone in its review of their self-titled debut. "The lyrics, unwisely printed inside, are as preachy and lovepeace cloying as anything Motown has done recently." Taking note, White abandoned the line-up, save his brother, and formed a new band based around younger musicians - notably singing percussionist Philip Bailey, recruited from a Denver R&B outfit called Friends & Love. It marked the beginning of the group's imperial phase. 1973's Head to the Sky brought new audiences while the 1974 follow-up, Open Our Eyes, was their first genuine hit. A year later, they scored their only number one single with the slinky, irresistible Shining Star. The song came to White when he took a night-time walk in rural Colorado, where the band were recording their landmark 1975 album, That's the Way of the World. Overwhelmed by the beautiful clarity of the night sky, he came up with the chorus - "Shining star for you to see / What your life can truly be" - and brought it to the rest of the band. They spent days perfecting the track, with White and Bailey layering vocal upon vocal to create the stark a capella fade at the end of the song. Speaking to MixOnline in 2004, the band said they had been determined to make a crossover hit. "This was an important album - one that signaled whether we would go on and become a mainstream group or just be an R&B act," Verdine White said. "At that particular time, they didn't really cross a lot of black acts over to mainstream radio. We already had two Gold albums but still, most of the mainstream didn't know who we were." The success of the song, earned the band a Grammy nomination for best R&B vocal performance - but the band weren't enamoured with the ceremony. "At the time, African-Americans didn't get their Grammys on television, so we didn't go," said White. "We didn't think too much about the awards. We just stayed focused on the music." By the end of the decade, the band was a regular presence on the pop charts, with melodic hits like After The Love Has Gone and Boogie Wonderland (a collaboration with The Emotions). Their 1978 greatest hits collection The Best of Earth, Wind & Fire, Vol. 1 sold five million copies in the US, and was their first top 10 record in the UK - thanks in part to a cover of The Beatles' Got to Get You into My Life. They worked hard and toured hard, with White enforcing a zero tolerance policy on showbusiness excess. "No, we don't deal in drugs in any way," he said in 1975. "It's not necessary if your spirit is clear and your mission is positive. Yes, it is true that a lot of entertainers don't follow these kind of guidelines - that is many times because they are in it for the wrong reasons." After weathering the thinly-veiled racism of America's "Disco Sucks" movement, Earth Wind & Fire continued to score hits in the 1980s, adotping a new, electronic edge to keep up with prevailing musical trends. But 1983's Electric Universe was an unexpected flop, and Philip Bailey embarked on a solo career - scoring a global hit with Easy Lover, his duet with Phil Collins. That redressed an imbalance within the band, that allowed them to reform on a more equal footing in 1987. "We were a little inhibited to say things for fear of bruising Maurice's ego," Bailey told the LA Times. "He was sensitive to the fact that we were growing up [musically] and that we were disenchanted about certain things. But he was still in the driver's seat to make decisions. It created a lot of tension." The slimmed-down band scored yet another number one R&B single in 1987, System of Survival, and continue to tour and release albums to this day. White had been battling Parkinson's disease since 1992, and announced his diagnosis in 2000, the same year the band were inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. But he remained a passionate advocate for his band, and their cosmic message. "It's important to put the emphasis on the positive aspect," he told The Chicago Tribune. "I have learned that music helps a lot of people survive, and they want songs that can give them something - I guess you could call it hope."	To understand Earth Wind & Fire, you just had to look at their song titles: Mighty Mighty, Happy Feelin', Boogie Wonderland.
Mauritania, an Islamic republic, has not applied a death penalty since 1987. The Forum of Imams and Ulemas says Mohamed Ould Cheikh Ould Mkhaitir, 29, should be executed despite the fact that he repented for an article criticising Mauritania's caste system. The clerics want him to be killed according to the "law of God". The blogger was arrested in January 2014 for an article in which he lashed out at those who use religion as a means of discrimination against members of certain ethnic groups. The article was later taken down as it was deemed blasphemous towards the Prophet Muhammad. Mkhaitir then apologised and said he never meant to insult the Prophet. Mauritania's Supreme Court can pardon him if it feels his repentance is sincere. But ahead of the court's decision on Tuesday, the body of clerics said the blogger should not be shown any mercy. "We demand that the competent authorities apply the law," the Forum of Imams and Ulemas was quoted by Reuters as saying in a statement. "Kill him and bury him in conformity with the law of God," the statement added. Leading rights groups, including Freedom Now and the Committee to Protect Journalists, have campaigned for the blogger's release. Freedom Now, which represents him, said his trial was marred by procedural irregularities and that three of his lawyers had to resign after receiving death threats. Mauritania's caste system is a sensitive subject in a country with deep social and racial divisions. It has served as justification for the enslavement of members of Mauritania's Haratin ethnic group, often known as the "black moors". Last year, Mauritania introduced a tough new anti-slavery law which makes the offence a "crime against humanity". The country officially abolished slavery in 1981, but activists say it is still widely practised with children born into slavery.	A body of Muslim clerics in Mauritania has called for the death sentence to be carried out against a blogger convicted of apostasy in 2014.
Mr Farage had previously said he would stand down after failing to win a seat in last week's general election. But the party said there was "overwhelmingly evidence" that UKIP members did not want Mr Farage to go. Writing in the Telegraph, Mr Farage said he had been "reluctant", but decided he "owed it to the party to stay" on as leader. UKIP won a 13% vote share in the election - some 3.8 million votes - and has one MP, Douglas Carswell, who held his Clacton seat. It puts the party in third place behind the Conservatives and Labour in terms of share of the vote. Mr Farage failed to gain the seat of Thanet South, losing out to Conservative candidate Craig Mackinlay. Speaking about his defeat, he insisted he had "never felt happier", with a "weight lifted off his shoulders". Who is more important to UKIP, Nigel Farage or Douglas Carswell? The answer to that question came just before 16:00 BST when the party announced its ex-leader was now its leader again. Nigel Farage has been persuaded to stay on. Technically he has managed to honour his pledge to stand down after he failed to get elected in Thanet South on Thursday. Two things are now clear: UKIP can't countenance a post-Nigel world. He is the party's biggest asset and it thinks a big chunk of those four million votes last week were down to him. But one senior figure has told the BBC Mr Farage's decision to stay is a "mistake" which will only undermine his reputation for straight talking. I think it's a safe bet to say that UKIP's only MP, Douglas Carswell, will not be happy. He heaped praise on his leader this morning but he spoke about him very much in the past tense. Party chairman Steve Crowther said the national executive committee believed the election campaign had been a "great success" and members had "unanimously" rejected Mr Farage's letter of resignation. "He has therefore been persuaded to withdraw his resignation and remains leader of UKIP," a party statement said. Writing in the Daily Telegraph, Mr Farage said he had initially been reluctant, but then "breathed deep, and thought for as long as I possibly had, given the meeting was ongoing". "I decided that as much as I had earned my holidays. As much as I wanted to spend the summer fishing, walking, and of course, in the European Parliament where all hell is currently breaking loose - that I owed it to the party that got me here," he said. He added there were "huge battles ahead", such as new EU proposals for Mediterranean migrant quotas and issues of electoral reform. Mr Farage had said repeatedly ahead of and during the general election campaign he had no intention of staying in the leader's job. In his autobiography, The Purple Revolution, he wrote: "It is frankly just not credible for me to continue to lead the party without a Westminster seat. He added: "Was I supposed to brief Ukip policy from the Westminster Arms? No - if I fail to win South Thanet, it is curtains for me. I will have to step down." The 51-year-old had recommended Suzanne Evans, the deputy chairman, to head the party until the leadership challenge was complete. Suzanne Evans said she was "very pleased" Mr Farage had agreed to remain leader. In a tweet, she wrote: "Very pleased @Nigel_Farage still at the helm. As stated previously, I tried to persuade him to stay and was never actually appointed leader!"	Nigel Farage is to remain as UKIP leader after the party rejected his resignation.
Jamie Rudling, 28, from Dunoon, repeatedly raped one victim, between 2003 and 2011, at an address in Argyll. He also raped a 22-year-old woman while she was asleep, in Argyll in 2014. At the High Court in Glasgow, Rudling was jailed for a minimum of three years and six months and told he may never be judged safe enough to be released. Passing sentence, judge Judge Lady Carmichael told Rudling: "You present a high risk to the public at large if you are at liberty. "You were sexually offending while on an extended sentence which was intended to protect the public." Lady Carmichael told Rudling that he showed a pattern of sexual offending from his teenage years and added: "It is significant that your pattern of serious sexual offending became as excessive as it did over a significant period." She added: "I am imposing a life-long restriction order. It is possible you many never be released. It will be up to the parole board to decide if he is ever released." Rudling was given three years probation in March 2010 after being convicted of attempting to rape a sleeping woman. He was also jailed for 28 months at Ayr Sheriff Court in November 2011 and placed under supervision for two years after he persuaded two teenage girls to expose themselves on a webcam. He also arranged to meet one for sex at Braehead Shopping Centre in Renfrewshire. Following his conviction, Rudling's counsel unsuccessfully argued for him to be given an extended sentence rather that a life-long restriction order. Lady Carmichael dismissed imposing an extended sentence saying: "That has been tried already and there was re-offending."	A man who raped two women - one of them while he was on probation for grooming two teenage girls - has been handed a lifelong restriction order.
According to the corporation, "the extended Ten will give audiences even more news analysis and explanation". With additional news from the Nations and Regions, the programme will be 45-minutes long from Monday through to Thursday, starting from 11 January. The move follows a five-month trial in the run-up to the General Election. "Along with its sister programme at 6, The BBC's 10 o'clock News is already the most popular news bulletin in the UK and, in the New Year, it will offer even more," said Gavin Allen, controller of daily news programmes. "Viewers will continue to see the fullest range of stories - and now we'll have still more scope to explain the events that impact the country and help to make sense of the changing world around us." It's always been a bit odd that the BBC's highest profile news bulletin (if not highest rated - the audience for the Six o'clock News is bigger) has also been the shortest. Of course, the official duration hasn't always been stuck to. People who tune in just for the weather at the end of the bulletin will already know this - the news is sometimes two, three or even five minutes longer than it says on the schedules. It is, though, an interesting symbolic move. ITV's News at Ten presenter Tom Bradby has questioned the BBC scheduling its main news at 10pm, and so too has the culture secretary John Whittingdale. This certainly makes clear the BBC isn't planning on vacating the spot, but is digging in even deeper. Yet it does present a quandary for those who like to tuck in to Newsnight after the Ten.  Newsnight's start time is usually around 22:32. In future, if you stay with the News at Ten until the end of the weather, you will have missed the first 13 minutes of the programme. And finally, for fans of the red chair and the celebrity sofa, this is a Monday to Thursday-only change. Question Time on Thursday can be shunted, but Graham Norton, it appears, is sticking to his 22:35 slot.	The BBC's News at Ten is to run 10 minutes longer in the New Year, with the bulletin set to end at 22:45 GMT on every weekday except Friday.
Rooney, 28, is considering an offer that would make him the highest paid player in United's history. The England striker is in the final 18 months of his £250,000-a-week contract and Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho remains interested in signing him. United and Rooney hope to conclude contract talks in the coming week. Rooney, who joined United from Everton in August 2004, is the fourth-highest goalscorer in United history. However, according to former United manager Sir Alex Ferguson, Rooney asked for a transfer towards the end of last season. He was linked with a move to Chelsea last summer and the Blues had a bid rejected by United. Rooney scored 11 goals in 24 games for United this season before being sidelined by an injury which has kept him out since 1 January.	Manchester United have opened talks with Wayne Rooney over a new deal that could keep the striker at Old Trafford for the rest of his career.
Very occasionally tremors appear on the Zimbabwean political landscape that point to a shift in prospects for this rich but beleaguered southern African nation. For those of us who watch the changing fortunes of Robert Mugabe's Zimbabwe, the cautionary tale is always to expect the unexpected and to make no assumptions about the outcome. President Mugabe's ruling Zanu-PF party is riven with fresh divisions over who will succeed him - influential figures and names that once commanded entire chapters in the history of the nation's revolutions have been cast aside. For his part, the 92-year-old has long considered talk of a future in which he is absent as tantamount to treason. He is still the president and there is no vacancy for that post and the people, he says, should not be "confused by the confusionists". And for the last two years, his younger wife Grace has forced her will into the debate, seen one vice-president fired and is gunning for another while declaring just the other day that if needs be, Mr Mugabe would continue to rule from his grave. Hyperinflation and Zimbabwe's famous billion and trillion dollar notes are a thing of the past, but now hard currency has been in short supply. The liberalised dollar economy of 2009 is on the brink of collapse, there are long queues at banks which have limited the amounts people can withdraw  and there are plans to introduce new bond notes to ease the cash-flow crisis. Farai Sevenzo: "No inquiry, no arrests - just a $15bn hole in the nation's coffers" The country is importing more than it is selling, unemployment continues to soar, while a proud history of good education has only produced millions of vendors selling cheap goods and food to their fellow impoverished citizens as businesses fold around them. The country's major hospitals have at times gone without water and electricity, and it surprises no-one that the president's daughter gave birth in Singapore rather than a local maternity hospital; and that Morgan Tsvangirai, the leader of the official opposition, has been undergoing treatment in a South African hospital. The need for food is as real to millions as is the drought affecting all of southern Africa, and the politicians' preoccupation with the tragic soap opera of Mr Mugabe's last days on earth have offered no new plan to feed them and give them jobs. Instead, the headlines this year have celebrated his 92nd birthday, while he announced in March that $15bn (Â£10bn) of the country's diamond wealth had been looted and simply disappeared. No inquiry, no arrests - just a $15bn hole in the nation's coffers. In the context of this trying background, a 39-year-old pastor called Evan Mawarire, based in the capital, Harare, took to social media last month and called for Zimbabweans to re-own their flag, to stop wishing they lived in another country, and to force the politicians to answer questions on their lack of accountability and corrupt ways without fear. The hashtag #ThisFlag was born and internet-literate Zimbabweans within and outside the country began to air their frustrations, repeating the tag line "hatichada, hatichatya" - meaning in Shona "we've had enough, we are not afraid". They say they will refuse to bribe policemen, they will watch and circulate tales of corruption, they will not parrot the ruling party's excuses, which have for years blamed Western sanctions for dismal delivery of services and the ailing economy. Government loyalist ministers have dismissed the upstart #ThisFlag trend as an elitist diaspora-inspired movement that has been taking "to the Twitter", which would have no traction with the thousands of rural folk who have consistently voted President Mugabe back into power. Yet even as journalists reached for ill-matching Arab spring comparisons of revolution born out of social media, it was clear that a few hundred thousand citizens with access to smart phones had started a debate, which was not linked to a moribund opposition, whose loyalties were to the flag of nationhood rather than to the politics of personality. Zanu-PF elections have tended to be a united strategised persuasion of the electorate, which isolated the urban opposition and was not shy of violence and blatant bribery in money, maize or land. And a large proportion of the citizens kept their heads down and went about their business as activists disappeared and bones were broken. But the evidence of misrule is all around and if they can no longer afford to pay their children's school fees, they cannot afford to be apathetic. What is more, Zanu-PF's formidable united front is no more, everywhere you look former Mugabe loyalists are spouting the bitter language of opposition. Zimbabwe's next election is not due until 2018, but a "million man march" last week saw thousands of people on Harare's streets in a show of support for Mr Mugabe's candidature, while recent opposition marches in Harare and Bulawayo created a sea of red for the opposition Movement of Democratic Change (MDC). Only, it must be said, is the new party of Joice Mujuru, Mr Mugabe's sacked vice-president, shy of a protesting presence in the country. The starting gun for what is likely to be a game-changing election has been fired 18 months early. And it will be a vote in which citizen apathy may well be a thing of the past. More from Farai Sevenzo:	In our series of letters from African journalists, the film-maker and columnist Farai Sevenzo looks at why Zimbabweans are turning to their flag to demand accountability from politicians.
Legally, it needs at least 5% of local electors for a referendum to go ahead. Those behind the petition say a mayor would offer more dynamic leadership and "rise above party politics". Council leader Tim Warren said it felt "unnecessary" so soon after the elections. If successful, a directly elected mayor would replace him. The council announced on Monday that it had received 6,818 valid signatures. A further 2,789 signatures were ruled to be invalid. Directly elected mayors were created by the Local Government Act 2000 as one option for local government, as long as the idea was backed in a referendum. Bath & North East Somerset Council said the threshold set out under the 2000 Act had been reached and "it is anticipated that the referendum will be held early next year". In Bath, the council is run by a leader and cabinet system. Philip Raby, one of the team working for a referendum, said they favoured holding it on 5 May 2016, the day of the police and crime commissioner elections. He felt a directly elected mayor would offer "visible and accountable leadership" for the wider area - something he felt the current system did not offer. Mr Warren said there were "challenging budgetary issues" to concentrate on and questioned whether there was much public appetite for a referendum. Local petitions sparked referendums which resulted in elected mayors in Salford, Greater Manchester in 2012 and in Copeland, Cumbria in 2015. The Localism Act 2011 allowed central government to trigger referendums for elected mayors - but of the ten held in May 2012, only Bristol voted in favour of getting a mayor.	A referendum on an elected mayor for Bath and North East Somerset will be held in 2016, after a petition reached the threshold of 6,437 votes.
This quote - attributed to a Professor Aaron Levenstein - perfectly captures the dangers of making miscalculations, or generalisations, based on data sets. When it comes to data, nothing is ever clear cut. And 'The Thinning Blue Line' report released today by Reform Scotland, on how more Scottish police officers are solving fewer crimes, is a good case study. Here, I pose and attempt to answer some key questions......... On the face of things, the report's findings are correct. On a per officer basis, the clear-up rate has decreased from 12 to 8 between 2006/7 and 2013/14. The report argues this shouldn't be happening when crime rates are falling, and there are now more than 1,000 additional officers to work on fewer recorded offences. There are a couple of problems I found when I quickly dug a little deeper into how the report presented the data. One must also try and place these figures into context. Surely more officers won't necessarily equate to more crimes solved. Each crime should be taken on its own merit. What leads are there? What forensic evidence is left behind? What about crimes that maybe take more than one year to solve? What about the rise of internet crime and its online perpetrators who can be trickier to bring to justice? And, as one freedom of information request that I submitted earlier this year shows, what about the average 58 officers who were on stress-related leave between April 2013 and December 2014? On paper there are more officers, but in reality a number were on the bench unable to work on solving crimes. The report makes assumptions, which may well be true, that any increases in unsolved crimes are due to more officers being placed into positions previously held by civilian staff - essentially taking officers off the streets. However, the report doesn't seem to have the data or proof to categorically support this claim, but rather relies on "Underpants Gnomes" logic (go on - look it up). Indeed the report quotes Chief Constable Sir Stephen House in stating to Holyrood's Justice Committee that "under the terms on which staff go, jobs are in most instances closed down, so in the vast majority of cases there is no backfilling [by police officers] to be done". So if backfilling is happening, how many officers is it really impacting? To what extent is this a permanent occurrence, or to just fill in to cover an occasional civilian staff absence? If ever a freedom of information request could be used to strengthen an argument, this would be it. Although to be fair, backfilling civilian or administrative posts with police officers was a point the government failed to address in its official response.	"Statistics are like bikinis - what they reveal is suggestive, but what they conceal is vital."
"The truth is that Taylor Swift and I are together, and we're very happy," the actor told the Hollywood Reporter. "That's the truth," he continued. "It's not a publicity stunt." Hiddleston has been speaking about his first Emmy nomination for The Night Manager, saying it was "fantastic" to to be up for outstanding lead actor. Hiddleston played concierge-turned-spy Jonathan Pine in the BBC's adaptation of John le Carre's novel. He was nominated on Thursday for the prize for lead actor in a miniseries or movie, alongside fellow Brits Benedict Cumberbatch and Idris Elba, and US stars Bryan Cranston, Cuba Gooding Jr and Courtney B Vance. But it is speculation about his relationship with Swift that has been rife in the press since they were snapped embracing near Swift's home in Rhode Island last month. The images went viral online. Hiddleston, 35, who is in Australia shooting reprising his Loki role in the latest Thor film, had previously refused to discuss the relationship with the press. There had been reports that they could have been filming a music video together. "I'd rather just talk about my work if that's all right," he told one reporter in Queensland earlier this week. But when asked by the Hollywood Reporter how he would "respond to people who claim that you're involved in some sort of publicity stunt", the British actor rejected the "notion". The magazine reported that he laughed at the question and thanked them for asking it. Swift was previously in a relationship with Scottish DJ Calvin Harris, who 'unfollowed' her on Twitter after images of the singer kissing Hiddleston appeared online.

Media playback is not supported on this device The referee stopped the contest at the Titanic Exhibition Centre in the fourth round after the outclassed Slavchev lifted the Belfast man off his feet. Flyweight Barnes, 29, had been on top against the Bulgarian who had lost 24 of 33 previous bouts. Light-flyweight Jamie Conlan beat Hungarian David Koos on points. The Belfast boxer was the victor on a unanimous decision and now awaits a final eliminator for a world title fight. Marco McCullough defeated Luis Ligo in his fight for the vacant WBO Intercontinental featherweight championship when his opponent failed to come off his stool for the fifth round. Barnes's professional bow was much anticipated after a distinguished career in the amateur ranks. "It was hard to pin him down," said Barnes after the strange conclusion. "I was trying too hard to impress. You didn't see the best of me." Earlier, Belfast's Steven Ward, 26, marked his professional debut with a points win over 31-year-old Bulgarian Merdjidin Yuseeinov. Ward, who won silver at the 2010 Commonwealth Games, produced a steady display and was declared the winner by 40 points to 36. Tyrone McKenna won the Celtic super-lightweight belt by stopping Dublin opponent Sean Creagh. Unbeaten McKenna, 26, was well on top when Creagh's corner retired their man before the sixth and final round.	Double Olympic bronze medallist Paddy Barnes won his pro debut fight in unusual circumstances when opponent Stefan Slavchev was disqualified.
The London derby will kick off at 17:15 BST on Saturday, 22 April. Spurs are one of only four clubs to beat Premier League leaders Chelsea this season - a 2-0 victory in January. The second Wembley semi-final between Arsenal and Manchester City, which will kick off at 15:00 BST on Sunday, 23 April, will be shown on BT Sport, with highlights later on BBC One. Tottenham won the 1967 FA Cup with a 2-1 win over Chelsea, while the Blues beat Spurs 5-1 in a semi-final at the new stadium on their way to winning the competition in 2012. It is the third meeting between the sides the season - Chelsea won 2-1 at Stamford Bridge in November - and Spurs will hope to have striker Harry Kane back from an ankle injury. Football Focus will come live from Wembley on the Saturday as part of the build-up to the semi-final. Chelsea beat holders Manchester United 1-0 on Monday to reach the semi-finals, a day after Tottenham thrashed League One side Millwall 6-0 in their quarter-final.	The FA Cup semi-final between Chelsea and Tottenham at Wembley Stadium will be broadcast live on BBC One.
The woman, aged in her 20s, was attacked after leaving the event's Chinawhite enclosure early on Sunday, with men she met there. She walked with them to the Harpsden Road and Reading Road area and was raped outside a car, which the men then drove off in. A passerby found the victim near the Three Horseshoes pub shortly after. Daniel Grist, secretary of the regatta, said: "We have been liaising with Thames Valley Police, regarding this terrible incident, which took place after Regatta facilities had closed and racing had finished for the day on Saturday 1 July. "The Chinawhite area is not located on land managed by Henley Royal Regatta but we will continue to assist Thames Valley Police and are working with them to secure CCTV footage to assist in identifying the perpetrators." Thames Valley Police is appealing for witnesses, and specially-trained officers are supporting the woman, who left the Chinawhite enclosure between 00:00 and 02:30 BST. Det Ch Insp Lis Knight said such incidents were rare in the area. The Â£3m rowing regatta sees more than 200 races take place on the river Thames over five days. The annual regatta, which has been held since 1839, was expected to attract 200,000 spectators to this year's event.	Organisers of the Henley Royal Regatta are supplying hours of CCTV footage to police after a woman was raped.
It replicates the repeating lattice of sodium and chloride ions found in a crystal of salt (NaCl). Standing more than 3m tall, the model was built by Dr Robert Krickl from nearly 40,000 balls and 10km of sticks. The world record attempt will be adjudicated by the Guinness Book of Records on 23 November. It will be on public display until 30 November, and has already been commemorated on an Austrian postage stamp. "I want to show - to visualise - how our world looks when it's magnified about a billion times," Dr Krickl, a crystallographer turned science communicator, told Science in Action on the BBC World Service. Because of the regular pattern it is built up from, which causes hundreds of the "ions" to form precise lines from multiple angles, the huge model has a rather dazzling appearance. It also has particular significance this week, Dr Krickl said. "This week it's the 100th anniversary of the Nobel Prize for discovering what I show with this model: the arrangement of atoms in crystals." The British father-and-son team of William and Lawrence Bragg won the physics Nobel in 1915 for originating the technique that is now known as X-ray crystallography. "This discovery really had a major impact on science and our understanding of the world," Dr Krickl said. "It led to the determination of the structure of DNA, of viruses, of proteins - and on the other hand, of materials used in our daily lives, for technology to build faster, better lighter machines." To mark this anniversary, on Thursday he welcomed representatives from the British Council and the British Embassy to view the nearly completed structure.	The world's biggest crystal structure model - a 3D chemical illustration made from little balls and sticks - is being assembled in Vienna's city hall.
Murray, 25, who has already secured Rio Olympic qualification, was down in 21st after the fencing round. Strong swimming and run-shoot combined events helped her climb to ninth and reach Sunday's final in Bath. She is joined by Great Britain team-mates Kate French, Freyja Prentice and Francesca Summers. Britain will claim the maximum of two Olympic berths for the women's event if any of the GB athletes - other than Murray - can finish in the top eight in Sunday's final at the University of Bath. "I sometimes struggle to find that spark and have the same adrenalin that I do in the final during qualification," said Murray, who was fourth in the women's team event alongside Mhairi Spence on Wednesday. "Hopefully I can step things up at the weekend," she added. World junior champion Summers, who won Youth Olympic silver in 2014, secured the last automatic qualification place in the first of the combined heats. "I took lots of confidence from winning world junior gold in Mexico," she told BBC Sport. "It's a big step-up in standard, but the target was to reach the final and I'm so happy I've done that." On Saturday Jamie Cooke, Tom Toolis and Joe Choong will compete in the men's final knowing a top-eight finish will attain them a Rio Olympic qualification.	Olympic silver medallist Samantha Murray recovered from a difficult start to remain on course for a first individual European pentathlon title.
Media playback is not supported on this device Jean-Marc Bosman did not trademark any moments of skill, score famous late winners or carry his teams to success but he was good enough to win 20 youth caps for Belgium and break into the first team of one of his country's best clubs at 18. That, however, is not what earns him a place alongside Charlemagne, Audrey Hepburn and Hercule Poirot in a list of famous Belgians. Twenty years ago on Tuesday, Bosman emerged from the European Court of Justice with a win that turned Europe's top divisions into glorious expressions of multiculturalism and added a new noun to sport's lexicon: the Bosman. From that moment, players at the end of their contracts - David Beckham, Sol Campbell, Steve McManaman and many more - could move without a transfer fee. No longer would a player from the European Union have their opportunities in the single market curtailed by rules limiting the number of foreigners clubs could field. But for this softly spoken 51 year old, it was a case that almost ruined him. "There have been real problems but I am feeling much better now," said Bosman when I asked him how he was after a spell in prison, bankruptcy and a long battle with alcoholism. "I've had medical and psychological care and I also have blood samples taken on a regular basis. "There have been difficulties and my financial situation is not easy but life has started over. I have regained strength and feel motivated. "It has not been easy to find work after the ruling but I am not complaining. The tunnel is nearing its end." He entered that tunnel in 1990 when his contract with RFC Liege expired. With the club in financial trouble they wanted the midfielder to sign a new deal on a quarter of his former salary. Yet when Dunkerque, across the border in France, wanted to buy him, Liege demanded four times what they'd paid for him in the first place. "It was illogical," said Bosman, explaining the moment he decided to become a "freedom fighter". His lawyer thought it would take two weeks. It took five years; a period that should have been the best years of a decent career. Banned in Belgium, Bosman moved to a second division club in France, only for them to go bust. Other clubs told him they would like to sign him but could not because they already had three foreigners. He had a brief spell on the island of La Reunion and another go in the Belgian leagues, but it is an understatement to say his decision to take football's business model to court made him less attractive to club chairmen. Broke, tired and out of shape, he accepted 350,000 Swiss francs in damages for his legal victory and began a life after football that he is still trying to work out. There was a disastrous investment in a t-shirt business (he had hoped grateful footballers would buy one, only his lawyer's son did so) and problems with the taxman. In 2011, he was convicted of assault following claims he had been involved in an argument with his girlfriend after he asked her daughter to get him some booze.  Initially, the courts were lenient but when he failed to pay his fine they were left with little choice. He was sentenced to a year in prison in 2013. It was then that Fifpro, the international trade union for footballers, stepped in. The stars he had helped become multi-millionaires may have forgotten him but his union did not. "I was young and handsome then and I now have become old," he explained. "Most of the players won't be able to recognise me but my case is still being talked about - I think that is positive. "I may not be here in 20 years' time but they will still be talking about it and if someone remembers me I will give him my bank details. Everyone benefited from the Bosman ruling except me!" I am speaking to him at Fifpro's swish headquarters in a suburb of Amsterdam. Bosman has become a spokesman for the organisation's campaign to finish what he started: scrap transfer fees entirely. The best way to understand this is to view Bosman as a battle in a 125-year war between clubs and players. The players won Bosman but were "ambushed", in the words of Fifpro's general secretary Theo van Seggelen, six years later. The European Commission made a deal with the game's governing bodies, Uefa and Fifa, to stem what the clubs claimed was rampant "player power". This deal was enshrined in Fifa's Regulations on the Status and Transfer of Players in 2001. These rules set out today's transfer system - windows - the concept of a protected period when a contract cannot be broken, maximum and minimum contract lengths and so on - and for Fifpro they amount to the pendulum swinging towards the clubs. Five years later, a row about Scottish defender Andy Webster's move from Hearts to Wigan Athletic saw that pendulum swing back. The details of the case are convoluted but the final ruling seemed to fix what compensation a player/new employer should pay the old employer for breaking a contract outside of the protected period. This sum would be the wages the player would earn if he stayed. This really could have been revolutionary but two years later the Court of Arbitration for Sport changed the compensation equation by adding pro rata slices of the initial transfer fee and an estimate of the player's replacement cost. Players such Andrea Pirlo or Robert Lewandowski could still let their contracts expire to get Bosman moves to new teams and bigger wages. But clubs wanting to sign players still under contract, even outside the protected period, would have to cough up some compensation, as Manchester City did with Raheem Sterling last summer. Quite right too, is the usual response to this compromise between a player's right to ply his trade on the one hand, and a club's right to stability and a league's competitive integrity on the other. Everton manager Roberto Martinez, the first Spanish player to get a Bosman to England, has criticised the transfer window, but does not want to scrap compensation. "The Bosman ruling was a huge shock at the time but I used it and it now seems a normal way to move freely," said Martinez last week. "Football has benefited from the multicultural input of players and it seems normal now. "But it wouldn't be right to scrap transfer fees. The value of a footballer is important and the value of developing players is important." But Fifpro's Van Seggelen says this view is based on a misunderstanding of the players' position, as well as being unfounded in truth. Dr Stefan Szymanski, author of the best-selling Soccernomics and professor of sports management at the University of Michigan, did some research for Fifpro earlier this year which outlined how the system was failing to do any of the things it promised in 2001. According to Szymanski, the settlement has led to the rich clubs getting richer as more than half of all transfer spending circulates among them, with little trickling down the pyramid, far less than is syphoned off by agents. He also outlined how the same clubs and leagues keep winning, while the same types of clubs and leagues keep failing, leaving themselves, he says, vulnerable to match-fixing, third-party ownership and the trafficking of minors. "We thought the transfer system was finished on 15 December, 1995, but of course it isn't," explained Van Seggelen. "In fact, the situation is even worse than before. I often say to people 'how would you feel if you had to wait three months for your salary?' "You also have players waiting years for justice through the tribunal system, and even when he has a positive decision there is no enforcement system. We cannot accept that." That might win over a few more voters on the terraces but there will still be many in the "Bosman ruined football" camp who think this is simply a union fighting for more money for its members, and in this case the members are loaded. "Only 1% of our members are financially independent, so not every player is making that kind of money," said Van Seggelen. "We're not trying to make them richer. In an ideal world, every player would play at the level they belong. "I don't know why the clubs are so nervous. We are not trying to kill the top clubs or leagues. "Sport is unusual but it must be reasonable. It's an economic activity, a business, so it must respect the law." By this point, Bosman is outside smoking. Despite arriving late and looking like he could not wait for the interview to end, he was good company. He does not watch much football these days, he cannot afford the television subscriptions, but what he sees he enjoys. His main focus is looking after his two young boys and being a better dad to the grown-up daughter he has from an earlier relationship. "Martin and Samuel are too young to know about my case, I don't want to complicate their lives with it, they've just left kindergarten," he said. "But I think later, when they grow up, they could find out about what their dad has done for professional players on the internet and they will see their dad has done something good. "Back then clubs were selling hens, horses, mules and pigs, but not humans. "Players should be considered as workers, full stop, that's it! This is the Bosman ruling, and we ought to get back to it."	A Cruyff turn, Fergie time, the Matthews final: football's icons have often entered the language of the sport but can any of those greats claim to have changed the game as much as the nervous, middle-aged Belgian sitting in front of me?
The Belfast Policing and Community Safety Partnership's 'Drug Dealers Don't Care, Do You?' campaign ran from February to April. In that time, the PSNI also arrested 357 people and seized £44,000 in cash. Assistant Chief Constable Will Kerr said the principal drug seized was herbal cannabis. "Along with our partners, we've invested a considerable amount of time and effort into this campaign and it has delivered worthwhile outcomes," he said. "We arrested 357 suspects, charged 78 of them, reported 163 and released 55 on police bail." A spokesperson for Belfast PCSP said: "It's encouraging that the 'Drug Dealers Don't Care' campaign would appear to be having some impact in helping to tackle the scourge of drugs on our streets and in our communities. "These latest figures demonstrate that by working in partnership and coordinating our resources we can be more effective."	Almost £1.5m of illegal drugs have been seized in Northern Ireland following a media campaign against drug dealers, police have said.
Hooker Vicky Fleetwood will also remain in England for the next few days to undergo rehab for a minor injury. Forward Poppy Cleall, who has won 12 caps for England, including their 2017 Six Nations Grand Slam, has been called up as a replacement. England begin their campaign against Spain in Dublin on Wednesday. England women head coach Simon Middleton said: 'While it's disappointing for Emily, we know she will rehab diligently and we hope to have her fit and ready on standby if required later in the tournament. "With Vicky remaining in England for the time being, we have opted to call up Poppy, who offers us a bit more balance in the forwards" England squad in full: Forwards: Zoe Aldcroft, Sarah Bern, Rochelle Clark, Amy Cokayne, Vickii Cornborough, Sarah Hunter (C), Heather Kerr, Justine Lucas, Alex Matthews, Harriet Millar-Mills, Izzy Noel-Smith, Marlie Packer, Abbie Scott, Tamara Taylor, Poppy Cleall. Backs: Rachael Burford, Natasha Hunt, Megan Jones, La Toya Mason, Katy Mclean, Amber Reed, Leanne Riley, Emily Scarratt (VC), Lydia Thompson, Danielle Waterman, Kay Wilson, Amy Wilson Hardy.	England fly-half Emily Scott has been forced to withdraw from the squad through injury five days before the Women's World Cup starts in Ireland.
The incident took place close to Caernarfon's Crown Court and fire station just before 09:00 BST on Thursday. The mother-of-five was airlifted to hospital in Stoke-on-Trent. North Wales Police has said her 46-year-old partner has been arrested. "This is being treated as a domestic-related crime but I would like to reassure the community that a swift arrest was made," said Det Chf Insp Iestyn Davies. The Welsh Ambulance Service said they were called at 09:00 BST to reports that a woman had been assaulted. Police said the victim remains in a serious but stable condition. Forensic investigations are being carried out at the location, which links nearby estates to a local primary and secondary school.	A mother walking her children to school in north Wales is in hospital with serious injuries after being attacked on a busy footpath.
The cessation comes despite attempts to rescue the route in a £9m emergency deal, mostly from Stormont. Economy Minister Simon Hamilton had previously said the rescue package was crucial to attracted US-inward investment for Northern Ireland. A United Airlines statement said: 'We have regretfully taken this decision because of the route's poor financial performance." The ruling by the European Commission to block the funding package to protect Northern Ireland's one and only scheduled trans-Atlantic service defies logic and is an example of "abysmal Brussels decision-making". Managing Director Graham Keddie said:  "You could hardly get a worse example of process-driven madness. "This is a vital link for business and losing it will be a body blow to executive ministers who use it to promote Northern Ireland to would-be investors from the United States. "This is a bad day for the executive and a bad day for Northern Ireland." "The executive did the right thing with its bid to save this key route. There was a risk to the flight and we stepped in to save it. Faced with the same circumstances again, I would make the same decisions. All public money has been recouped with interest and we retained the route for a longer period. "Our decision to support the route was praised by many and, had we not have made an effort to save the United flight, we would have been rightly criticised. "We were always aware of the potential of an issue around state aid compliance, but given the tight timescale to put a package of support in place, approval by the European Commission could not be sought in advance of agreeing a deal with United." "This is an international embarrassment. "This is a huge blow to our international standing and the minister must tell us what he intends to do to sort it out." "Awarding a £9m subsidy for a global corporation, which makes billions every year, against the advice of senior civil service officials and against state aid rules, was a dangerous commitment of resources at a time of already stretched budgets. "The gamble taken by the executive has spectacularly crash landed and there are now very serious questions for the economy minister to answer. "We need to know what communication the minister had with the European Commission before and after he issued a ministerial direction, ignoring the advice of senior civil servants. "Additionally, Simon Hamilton must outline how much public money has been spent advertising the route since the direction was issued." Alliance MLA Stewart Dickson said the decision by United Airlines to halt its Belfast to Newark route is a serious blow to Northern Ireland, in economic and social terms. He said: "To lose our only direct air route from Northern Ireland to the United States will have a serious impact on our business community as well as local people using it to visit family or for holidays. Coming just weeks after United was offered £9 million to keep the route open after they threatened to pull it is a slap in the face to our Executive. "We now learn that the funding was blocked by the EU Commission and I am calling on the Executive to explain what discussions were held with the Commission before the announcement, which was made with great fanfare. Is this another case of the Executive seeking good news headlines without adequate preparation? Did they even bother to check if this funding could break EU rules? It looks like the Executive and the Department for the Economy have let us down again. "I have consistently challenged the Minister for Economy to reveal the evidence that he used in deciding to allocate this money to United Airlines in the first place. Every time he has been unable to give a satisfactory answer. "Now that he has also been knocked back by the European Union, it is evident that he didn't even bother to check whether he was allowed to do it, let alone complete an economic appraisal for it. "Maybe, in future, the minister will consider the need for proper due process to ensure that money is being spent on things that it can actually be spent on, and that will actually have a benefit to society as a whole." "I was against this subsidy being given to United in the first place. "There are better uses for the £9m, especially when we are always being told that money's too tight to mention for a lot of departments. "There was never a guarantee. If the European Commission had not put a stop to it (the deal), there was no guarantee United was going to preserve the route anyway."	Politicians and businesses have been reacting to United Airlines ending their flights from Belfast to Newark Airport.
Chisako Kakehi was arrested in 2014 and went on trial in Kyoto late last month. Her lawyers have pleaded not guilty on her behalf, and when her trial began she said only that she would "leave everything" to her defence team. But in court, asked if she killed her husband, she said there was "no mistake", the Mainichi reported. The 70-year-old said she committed the crime because her husband was not treating her well financially, and that she obtained the cyanide from a business associate. "I wasn't given any money after I married him," the Japan Times quoted Ms Kakehi as telling the court on Monday. "I have no intention of hiding the guilt. I will laugh it off and die if I am sentenced to death tomorrow." Prosecutors say Ms Kakehi targeted the men for their money and poisoned them all with cyanide. The investigation began when Isao Kakehi, her fourth husband who she reportedly met via a match-making site, died on 28 December 2013, a month after they got married. A post mortem examination subsequently found traces of cyanide in his body, and investigators then began examining the deaths of other men linked to the pensioner. She is now on trial for murdering him and two other boyfriends, and the attempted murder and robbery of another boyfriend who later died of cancer. The men were all aged between 70 and 80 when the alleged crimes took place between 2007-2013. Ms Kakehi's three other husbands also all died, but she has not been charged in connection with their deaths. Lawyers for Ms Kakehi say her testimony cannot be trusted, because she has mild dementia. "Since she is suffering from dementia, she barely remembers things that happened recently let alone the incidents," her team was quoted as saying at the start of the trial, which is expected to continue until November. Japanese press have dubbed Ms Kakehi a "black widow" - a term derived from the female spider that eats its partner after mating. In April another Japanese woman, Kanae Kajima, who was convicted of killing three lovers, lost a final appeal against her death sentence at the Supreme Court.	A Japanese pensioner accused of killing three partners and attempting to murder a fourth has told a court that she fatally poisoned her husband.
The stone is thought to have been in Soulbury, Buckinghamshire for 11,000 years. The road was built round it. Residents said they would chain themselves to it when the council said the stone may have to be moved. The council has now said it would be "lunacy" to move it, but was looking for ways to make the road safer. Local legend claims the rock, known as the Soulbury Boot, appeared on Chapel Hill after villagers fought with the devil and cut off his foot. Some people also claim it rolls down the hill as the church chimes midnight. More rolling news from Buckinghamshire as it happens It is not known how the boulder gets back up the hill, but it was in its usual place when a motorist allegedly hit it, damaging her car and later claiming compensation, according to the Leighton Buzzard Observer. A Buckinghamshire County Council spokesman told the BBC it had been discussing the future of the stone with the parish council "following the alleged incident". Removing the stone was "an option" but the council was aware it would not be a popular choice. A Facebook community group launched a Save our Soulbury Stone (Soss) campaign calling for residents to reject any proposal to move it, with some vowing to chain themselves to the rock to protect it. However, Conservative councillor Mark Shaw has now told the BBC that "to move it, or even discuss moving it... would be absolute madness". He described it as the "heart and soul" of Soulbury. "What we want to do is clearly make the road safe and secure for all drivers but actually it would be absolute lunacy to move that stone," Mr Shaw said. "Let's bear in mind this is about one person who's crashed into this stone in over 11,000 years."	A large boulder which has sat in the middle of a road for decades is to stay where it is despite a car crashing into it, a council has said.
It comes amid growing concern that the next branch of so-called Islamic State (IS) could emerge in the region. David Cameron said "brutal terrorists" would only be defeated if countries united against their "common enemy". Mr Cameron is to raise the issue in meetings with the leaders of both countries during the four-day trip. He is heading to Indonesia on the first stop of his tour, which is primarily intended to boost trade with Britain. But Mr Cameron will also use his visit to discuss the threat from Islamist extremism with his counterparts, President Joko Widodo of Indonesia, and later Prime Minister Najib Razak of Malaysia. The UK government estimates about 500 people from Indonesia and about 200 from Malaysia have joined IS in Iraq and Syria. The prime minister is said to be "keen to explore" whether the UK can offer more practical counter-terrorism support to both countries, such as disrupting foreign fighters, investigating potential terror plots and improving aviation security. He is also planning to learn from their work in tackling the extremist ideology and encouraging tolerance, to explore whether the UK can learn from their approach. Speaking ahead of his departure for Indonesia, Mr Cameron said IS was "one of the biggest threats our world has faced". "All of us face a threat from foreign fighters and from increasing radicalisation within our countries and it's right that we look at what help we can provide to one another," he said. Separately, it is understood the UK government has had discussions about its role in tackling IS in Libya. There is no suggestion of any air strikes but it is thought the UK has considered what help it could offer in combating IS's presence if a stable Libyan government was formed.	The prime minister is expected to offer Indonesia and Malaysia support in tackling Islamist extremists, during a trade mission to South East Asia.
The mosaics, part of a 1,700-year-old town house, were found on the site of a development in Leicester. Open days attracted thousands of people but a question mark hung over the fate over the most spectacular finds. Now city mayor Sir Peter Soulsby has confirmed they will form part of a Â£7m revamp of the nearby Jewry Wall museum. The excavation recovered hundreds of artefacts - including a gruesome carved handle depicting people being fed to lions - but the mosaics were the largest found in the city for 150 years. Speaking at the final open day on Sunday, archaeologist Jon Coward said: "The big mosaic will be lifted and conserved but quite where it will end up I couldn't tell you but it should be made available. "One of the things that could happen is it could go in the Jewry Wall Museum or it could go in the foyer of the building on this site, that is up to the developers." Sir Peter Soulsby said has now said that after discussions with developers and archaeologists, a decision had been made. "The Jewry Wall Museum is the obvious place for this to go and after 1,700 years beneath our feet they could not have been found at a better time. "Other mosaics are currently undergoing restoration so this mosaic will join the wonderful artefacts we already have to  make a world class visitor attraction." It is hoped the refurbished museum will open in two years.	High-status Roman floors discovered by archaeologists during building work will go on permanent display, it has been confirmed.
The made-up Elwyn Davies was second only to UKIP MEP Nathan Gill in name recognition, ahead of Jill Evans, Derek Vaughan and Kay Swinburne. The figures emerged in the 2016 Welsh Election Study. Cardiff University's Professor Roger Scully said voters were "unlikely to notice" the loss of MEPs after Brexit. But Mr Vaughan, a Wales MEP since 2009, said it is "difficult" for MEPs to get recognition. Prof Roger Scully, principal investigator for the Cardiff University-led 2016 Welsh Election Study, said it was probably unsurprising that Mr Gill came top given his higher profile role in the assembly election campaign. "But none of the other Welsh MEPs were selected by a greater proportion of the study respondents than that legendary figure in Welsh politics 'Elwyn Davies' - whose contributions to our national political life I feel I need not elaborate upon," he said. Prof Scully, who spent the early part of his career studying in the European Parliament, said most MEPs are "very hard-working individuals". But he added: "We will, of course, very likely be losing our MEPs when the UK leaves the EU. "But on these results, it seems fair to say that most of the Welsh public are unlikely to notice." Those surveyed were asked: "Wales is represented by four members in the European Parliament. Which, if any, of the following people are among Wales' four representatives in the European Parliament?" They were given only 30 seconds to answer, to prevent them from searching on the internet, and were given the choices of four entirely made-up names and two real MEPs. The findings suggest that Wales's four MEPs - UKIP's Mr Gill, Plaid Cymru's Ms Evans, Labour's Mr Vaughan and the Conservatives's Ms Swinburne - were picked out by members of the public who saw the names with a breakdown of 16%, 11%, 9% and 6% respectively. But the made-up Elwyn Davies was chosen by 12% of those who saw "his" name, beating all the MEPs apart from Mr Gill. Out of the remaining made-up names, David Sherwood was picked by 5%, Lynn Goodwin 5% and Jenny Green 5%. Labour MEP Mr Vaughan, in response to the Welsh Election Study press release, said: "I have offices in South Wales and North Wales and do regular visits across the constituency but it is impossible to try to cover all of Wales in a way which ensures people recognise you." The data was collected by YouGov via the internet in March 2016 and 3,272 people responded.	A fictitious MEP was recognised by a greater percentage of people than three real ones, a survey has suggested.
Ms Jones told BBC Radio Wales she did not want to give up being an AM to go to Brussels to replace Nathan Gill, UKIP Wales leader. Mr Gill has been told by the UKIP assembly group and the UKIP party chairman Steve Crowther to stop "double-jobbing" as an AM and MEP. Mr Gill said those making such calls were doing it out of "malice". "We've got Brexit now and I think that, possibly, it may be best to leave that role unfilled," Ms Jones told the Good Morning Wales programme. "I'm surprised I've not been formally asked what I'd like to do." Ms Jones, the South Wales West AM, is one of two people who could take up the role of UKIP Wales MEP if Mr Gill made it vacant - the other being South Wales East AM David Rowlands. She would, in theory, have first refusal over Mr Rowlands as she was third in the 2014 UKIP European Parliament election list and Mr Rowlands was fourth. The number two candidate, James Cole, is no longer in the party. Asked if she would give up her position as AM to become an MEP, she said: "No I wouldn't. I'm not interested. Since becoming an AM I've thrown myself totally into what I'm elected to do. "They'd have to ask David Rowlands obviously but neither of us have formally been asked, although David may say 'oh no I'm settling in in his role', and he is actually, he's doing very well. "Quite frankly I think it's impossible to do two jobs, especially when one is in Brussels and Strasbourg and the other is in the Welsh Assembly. It's a very difficult situation."	UKIP's Welsh MEP post may be better left unfilled as a result of Brexit, party AM Caroline Jones has said.
He said the UK government would make a recommendation to the British people on which way to vote in the referendum. But he told MPs "it will be open to individual ministers to take a different, personal decision while remaining part of the government". The referendum on whether the UK stays in the EU will be held before 2018. A number of cabinet ministers are thought to favour an out vote, with Mr Cameron expected to campaign for Britain to remain in the EU, although he has said he rules nothing out if he does not get what he wants from his renegotiations. If the PM had decided to insist on collective cabinet responsibility, he would have been forced to sack ministers who disagreed with him. Mr Cameron told MPs: "Ultimately, it will be for the British people to decide this country's future by voting In or Out of a reformed European Union in the referendum that only we promised and that only a Conservative-majority government was able to deliver." Asked by Labour MP Emma Reynolds why it was not possible for him to persuade his own ministers to back him, he said: "The entire government is signed up to the position of having a successful renegotiation and having a referendum and everybody backs that plan." But he added: "There are people who have longstanding views about the European issue and... it's never been my intention to strongarm people into voting for a position that they don't agree with". Analysis by the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg Much of the running here, and perhaps all along, has been made by Eurosceptics in the Conservative Party. In the words of one minister "they are framing it all", and David Cameron's reversal of his position from 12 months ago when he ruled out a free vote has been forced by pressure from those who want to leave the EU. Read Laura's full blog "We don't yet know what the government's recommendation will be - we don't know when the deal will be done. I hope February but it could take considerably longer." Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said Mr Cameron had "never wanted to hold" a referendum and other European leaders could see that his negotiating demands were "a bluff, a fig leaf for Conservative Party politics". The SNP's leader at Westminster, Angus Robertson, demanded a guarantee that the people of Scotland would not be "taken out of the EU against their will". Mr Cameron said Scotland had voted to remain part of the UK. Former Chancellor and veteran Europhile Ken Clarke told BBC Radio 4's The World at One Mr Cameron had been forced into a "most unfortunate" decision and any ministers that disagreed with the PM's position should resign and argue for withdrawal from the backbenches. Former deputy PM Lord Heseltine - who last month warned of a Tory "civil war" if ministers were allowed to openly defy the prime minister and suggested Mr Cameron would be seen as a global "laughing stock" if he allowed it - declined to comment on the PM's decision. But the move was welcomed by those campaigning to get Britain out of the EU. Matthew Elliott, chief executive of Vote Leave, said: "The referendum could be as little as 170 days away, so ministers should be allowed to campaign openly as soon as the renegotiation is complete - and certainly no later than the end of the European Council in February. "The British people deserve to hear where their elected representatives stand on this vitally important issue. We've had lots of useful meetings with government ministers and look forward to working with them much more closely now." Brian Monteith, of Leave.EU, said: "We welcome the news that ministers will be allowed to campaign with their conscience in the referendum. "However, this is not about them. It will be ordinary people such as nurses, taxi drivers and small business owners that need to have their voices heard in this debate." UKIP leader Nigel Farage said the PM's decision was a short term solution to "hold together" the Conservative Party but as the referendum approached cabinet differences could become "irreconcilable." He said David Cameron would be "surprised" at the number of Conservatives who will campaign with UKIP to leave the EU. Will Straw, executive director of Britain Stronger In Europe, said: "We are confident that after the prime minister's successful renegotiation, the majority of Conservative ministers will continue to make the case that the benefits of being inside Europe... clearly outweigh the costs." Alan Johnson, who chairs the Labour In For Britain campaign, said: "While the Tories are divided on Europe, Labour is clear that Britain's national interest is best served by campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU." Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron, who is campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU, accused Mr Cameron of "putting his own internal party strife above what's best for Britain". "The government should take a collective position on this issue, and if ministers disagree with the prime minister they should resign." Speaking before news of Mr Cameron's decision emerged, London Mayor Boris Johnson told LBC radio: "I think we've got to be prepared to walk away, but at the moment I am backing the prime minister to get a great deal for this country and for Europe." He rejected the idea that Mr Cameron would have to stand down as prime minister if he lost the referendum and denied Tory MPs were at war over Europe. "We're not. Glutinous harmony prevails. We are backing David Cameron. I think he's doing a brilliant job," he added.

Georgia says Russian troops installed signs marking the "state border" of the breakaway region of South Ossetia further inside Georgian territory. The move has left a small portion of the Baku-Supsa oil pipeline under Russia's effective control. Russia has brushed off accusations about its role. Its troops have been patrolling the administrative border since the 2008 Russian-Georgian war over South Ossetia. An EU foreign policy spokesperson said the installation of new signposts "had led to tension in the area, with potentially negative effects on the local population, their livelihood and freedom of movement". "Steps that could be perceived as provocative must be avoided," the office of EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said in a statement. "The EU reaffirms its full support for Georgia's territorial integrity within its internationally recognised borders." Reports say markers have been placed at least 300m (980ft) further south into Georgian territory. The new border is now just 500m away from Georgia's main highway linking the Black Sea to Azerbaijan. On Tuesday Georgian Foreign Minister Tamar Beruchashvili condemned the border move as a continuation of "creeping Russian annexation". It leaves a 1.6km segment of a BP-operated Baku-Supsa pipeline outside Georgia's territory. However, Georgia's Energy Minister, Kakha Kaladze, and BP spokesperson Tamila Chantladze say BP has not had access to that section of pipeline since the 2008 war. Ms Chantladze stressed that the pipeline was operating as normal. Meanwhile a flag erected by Georgian protesters near the village of Khurvaleti, just south of the dividing line, has been removed by guards on the South Ossetian side, Georgia's Rustavi-2 TV channel reported on Thursday. In August 2008, tensions between Georgia and Russia escalated into a full-blown military conflict when Georgia tried to retake South Ossetia after a series of lower-level clashes with Russian-backed rebels. In the aftermath of the war, South Ossetia declared independence from Georgia and was recognised by Russia, although only a few other countries followed suit. In April 2009, Russia bolstered its position in South Ossetia by signing a five-year agreement to take formal control of its frontiers with Georgia proper. There have been long-standing concerns that tensions over Russia's influence in the region could have an impact on Georgia's strategic infrastructure.	The EU has warned of increased tensions amid claims that Russia has redrawn a section of Georgia's de facto border with South Ossetia.
The fast food company says it can't get hold of enough potatoes because of industrial action in America. As a result they're having to ration French fries for customers. "Unfortunately without this sales restriction step, we would run the danger of running out of fries at some of our stores around the end of the year," said McDonald's Japan spokeswoman Kokoro Toyama. There are more than 3,100 McDonald's outlets in Japan. For now they will only serve small portions of fries, though they won't restrict how many portions customers can order. More than 1,000 tonnes of potatoes have already been flown in to try to boost supplies. They started arriving this week. A further 1,600 tonnes will be imported by sea but they won't arrive until January. The industrial dispute in America is between 20,000 dockworkers and terminal operators and shipping lines at 29 ports on the west coast of the United States. This isn't the first time that Japan's been hit by a food shortage in recent weeks. For most of this month supplies of butter have been so low that supermarkets have had to limit customers to one pack each.

Media playback is not supported on this device Usain Bolt's defeat by Justin Gatlin in the last individual 100m he will ever run proved several things: that sport has less time for happy endings than scripted dramas; that time catches up even with someone who has made it his business escaping it; and that even the biggest party can be pooped if you let the wrong characters in. East End dramas need their villains, and on Saturday night in Stratford Gatlin played that role to eye-popping perfection. Twice caught doping, once facing a lifetime ban that was reduced first to eight years and then to four, he has long been the anti-poster boy for track and field - lacking any obvious remorse, humility left for others, a frequent swaggering reminder that cheats can still prosper should their legal team find the right angle to work. Not all the rancour has made logical sense. Others at these World Championships have returned from suspensions. Russia is banned indefinitely for its 21st century take on state-sponsored doping. Only Gatlin was booed every time he took to the blocks, from heats on Friday morning to semi-finals on Saturday evening and then the final itself. So it was that as he thrust his upper body across the finish line just after 21:45 BST - almost unnoticed in lane eight, outside the peripheral vision of Bolt in four and young American Christian Coleman in five - a wave of shock rolled around the packed slabs of supporters, turning to disbelief, to not wanting to accept what had just happened, to hoping something might suddenly be revealed to make it right. Gatlin does not find charm easy to access. He slammed on the brakes, jumped to attention and put a single, admonishing finger to his lips, daring the crowd to mock him now. Revenge, it seemed, was his - for the catcalls of the past two days, for those who considered him shot at 35, for the mess Bolt has made of his tilts at world and Olympic gold since he returned to competition an older and unapologetic man in 2010. And then you heard the crowd respond again, first the thousands close to him on the top bend, then those all around the oval track. "Usain Bolt! Usain Bolt! Usain Bolt!" This was Gatlin's moment of triumph: unacknowledged, unwanted, first mocking and then being mocked in return. The lap of honour? That went to Bolt. The first interview with the in-field presenter? Bolt. The one all the spectators ran down to trackside to touch and to photograph and to seize for selfies? Bolt. A victory, but a pyrrhic one. A defeat, but one that was treated like a triumph. The strangest of nights, and a strange truth: Gatlin may have deserved all of that - but he deserved this win too, in its technique and focus if not its ancestry. Media playback is not supported on this device In 2015, expected to beat an ailing Bolt at the last World Championships in Beijing. He had led with 15 metres to run only to over-stride with triumph in front of him and let the king cling on to his crown. Now, at an age when his youthful speed has leached away, he ran through the line as if nothing could touch him. Bolt's reaction to the gun was the slowest of anyone in the race. Five hundredths of a second ceded to Gatlin before a metre had been run, a hundredth more to Coleman. When the chase came, the invisible bungee cord of old had been replaced by a rope. There was acceleration but no surge. The champion tightened, but not the American kid nor the compatriot 14 years his senior. Gatlin finished in 9.92 seconds, Coleman in 9.94, Bolt in 9.95. Never before had the 30-year-old Jamaican run so slowly in a major final. In this same stadium, five golden summers ago, he had run 9.63. You can't keep stopping the clock. One day it will stop you. Media playback is not supported on this device The World Championships have defined Bolt and given him a simple narrative. Berlin 2009: his world record of 9.58, the greatest run of all. Daegu 2011: disqualified for a false start, his greatest disappointment. Beijing 2015: the defeat from nowhere of Gatlin, arguably his greatest miracle. This was supposed to be the great finale. That the story was hijacked by a darker subplot will leave some feeling as if something sacred has been blemished, that same sense of sadness experienced by those who saw boxer Muhammad Ali beaten in 10 melancholic rounds by Trevor Berbick in his own concluding fight. Yet sometimes perfection itself can become hard to understand when it seems to come so easy. In defeat, we can look back at all the glories of the past nine years and see that none were preordained and all claimed through an unprecedented blend of latent talent and unremitting hard work. Bolt has done so much on the track that no other human has ever managed. That his last individual race revealed him to have a few mortal flaws after all should not undermine his status. He talked of wanting to be remembered like Ali, like Pele. He will be. Gatlin has his world title - but never will he win the same affection nor respect. An imperfect ending, but with its own little perfections too. Media playback is not supported on this device	And so a perfect career ends in an imperfect way.
"This will give all European Leagues total freedom to schedule their matches as they see fit," said the European Professional Football Leagues group. The agreement ended on 15 March. It had been in place between the EPFL and Uefa to boost attendances and television viewing figures for European matches. Arsenal's FA Cup replay against Hull City in March 2016 was given special dispensation to be played on the same night as the Champions League last 16. Manchester City hosted Stoke City in a rearranged Premier League fixture last month on the same night as the Champions League last-16 ties between Barcelona and Paris St-Germain, and Borussia Dortmund and Benfica. The Premier League said the scheduling of the match on Wednesday, 8 March was "unavoidable", it was reported. It was also reported in April 2013 that the Football Association was fined £1.1m for allowing domestic matches to be played on the same night as European games. The EPFL said it will hold a general assembly of its member leagues in Geneva on 6 June.	European leagues are free to schedule domestic games on the same nights as Champions League and Europa League ties after an agreement with Uefa ended.
The presidential poll will take place next month and Uhuru Kenyatta is seeking re-election. On Friday, after a case brought by the opposition, the High Court ordered the electoral commission not to print ballot papers. Mr Kenyatta insisted the election would go ahead as planned. "This kind of intimidation will not be allowed and the election date will not change," he said. He said the judiciary could not claim independence and then use it to interfere with the functioning of the executive and other arms of government. The High Court argued that the tendering process for the ballot papers had not been transparent enough. The opposition National Super Alliance (Nasa) alleged that the president had links to Al Ghurair, the Dubai-based firm that won the $24m (Â£18m) tender. Al Ghurair and Mr Kenyatta deny any wrongdoing. The judges ruled that the company could still print ballots for the parliamentary and county elections, but the tender for presidential ballots should be re-advertised. Local media have reported that whoever takes on the job of printing and distributing the ballot papers will have just 30 days to do what is usually a 45-day task. In a separate development, Raila Odinga, Mr Kenyatta's main contender, was taken ill and admitted to hospital on Sunday with what his campaign team said was suspected food poisoning. Mr Odinga, speaking shortly after he was discharged from the hospital in the coastal city of Mombasa, said that he was "fit as a fiddle". "I had stomach pains, which have since disappeared after getting treatment," Mr Odinga said, adding: "I have been discharged to go to Nairobi to continue with my campaigns." Meanwhile, several people have reportedly been killed in clashes between rival political groups, rekindling memories of post-election violence in 2007-2008 that left more than 1,000 people dead.	Kenya's president has warned the country's judiciary not to help the opposition throw the next election into disarray.
He says small companies are not receiving the funding required to grow. "We have been appallingly bad at giving those minnows the long-term capital they need," said Mr Woodford. On the BBC, Tech Talent coverage is asking whether the UK can compete in the global tech industry. The UK is a magnet for entrepreneurs - around a third of them come from abroad. But according to Mr Woodford and others, home-grown tech entrepreneurs are not turning promising starts into leading global companies. Rory Cellan-Jones: Has the UK got Tech Talent? Mapping the UK's digital clusters On Monday, the BBC will look at the vibrant and growing UK tech scene and ask why it has failed to find a Google or Facebook. A variety of reasons have been put forward, including a digital skills shortage, a lack of leadership experience and difficulties in raising finance. Rohan Silva, a tech entrepreneur and former adviser to David Cameron when he was prime minister, says funding for start-ups has "long been seen as a big problem in the UK". "There's two types of funding," he told the BBC. "There's the funding that comes from friends, family and fools: the start-up money - £50,000, £100,000 - to get going. There we've really made a big difference in the UK. We've created the world's most generous tax breaks for that kind of investment." The second type is "scale-up cash" to help companies grow, which is still proving "a big challenge". "There is a big role for government in providing a bunch of that funding, particularly when it comes to research in the laboratory and helping that go to market," he says. Mr Woodford agrees that financing is a major constraint. "We have four of the top 10 universities in the world, 29 of the top 200. We do science and research really, really well in the UK and we're generating lots of little companies," Mr Woodford said. According to him, it is after this stage that the problems emerge. Mr Woodford argues that UK investors are too short-term and do not have the scale to support small technology firms. Hussein Kanji, co-founder of Hoxton Ventures, agrees: "It would still be hard for something like an Uber to be born out of the UK because I don't think there's a financing community that would give Uber the billions of dollars that it has consumed to get to global stage." Others point out that Silicon Valley has had longer to perfect the process. Eileen Burbidge has worked at Apple and Yahoo and is now a venture capitalist based in London. "They [Silicon Valley] did have an ecosystem that was cultivated in the 1940s and 1950s frankly by the US government and the defence industry that were originally in that part of California." One problem, Mr Silva says, is the UK's entrepreneur relief which gives a lower capital gains tax when businessmen and women sell their company. "The problem is this relief perversely encourages you to sell out early. If you did decide to try and build a Google or an Uber in this country, you'd actually pay a much higher tax rate than if you'd sold out and decided to live in a country mansion after a few years." Mr Woodford also believes that UK entrepreneurs have been too quick to sell out once the business gets going. But this is not a path that Taavet Hinrikus, chief executive and co-founder of London based peer-to-peer money transfer service TransferWise, is intending to follow. His company has become what is known as a unicorn - a company set up since 2000 which is now valued at more than $1bn (£770 mn). There are fewer than 20 in the UK. He said he would not sell-up at the moment. "We're just getting started with the company so why should we stop now? What would I do? I'd go on the beach for a day and then I would become incredibly bored and I would have the same urge to change the world for the better. I think starting over would be going backwards," Mr Hinrikus said. Another theory is that universities aren't being supportive enough. "We haven't been as opportunistic, adventurous and entrepreneurial as others," said Annalisa Jenkins, boss of Dimension Therapeutics, a gene therapy innovator. "In the past academics have traditionally viewed success, quite rightly, as their ability to publish their research in leading journals... the notion of turning their inventions into innovations that really drive value for people hasn't really been rewarded and recognised in terms of the culture of our country in the last 20 to 30 years," Ms Jenkins said. You can listen to the packages containing these interviews on the Today Programme on Monday.  Technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones, economics editor Kamal Ahmed and North America technology reporter Dave Lee will all be involved in the coverage of why the UK seemingly cannot match Silicon Valley.	Investors need to take a long-term view when backing new tech start-ups in the UK according to leading fund manager Neil Woodford, speaking as part of the BBC's Tech Talent coverage.
David Dixon texted his aunt saying he was safe after the two airport blasts, but his family fear he was caught up in a further explosion at a Metro station. Mr Dixon, from Nottingham, lived in the capital with his partner Charlotte Sutcliffe and their son. He is thought to be the only Briton still missing since Tuesday's attacks. Downing Street said four Britons were injured in the blasts, which left 31 people dead. Mr Dixon's partner told the Telegraph that police have his dental records and are seeing if they match any of the victims. How the day unfolded What we know about the attacks so far Airport security under the spotlight again Full coverage of the Brussels attacks His friend Simon Hartley-Jones said the couple had lived in Brussels for about 10 years but still had a house in Nottingham and came back regularly. "David is a programmer and works in the centre of Brussels," said Mr Hartley-Jones. "He makes his way there every day using the Metro system. "For some reason he hasn't made it... and we're really concerned about him. "It's really unusual for him not to contact [Charlotte] - it's really out of character." Updates on this story and more from Nottinghamshire He described Mr Dixon, originally from Hartlepool, as "a lovely guy" and "an amazing man who deeply, deeply loves his son". The couple's son was staying with friends and was unaware his father was missing, he added. "They still have a house in Mapperley [in Nottingham] which they come back to regularly, this is their home. "They were supposed to come back this weekend, all the family were due back this weekend to spend Easter with us here, and we're missing them deeply." Mr Hartley-Jones has appealed for anyone in Belgium who might know of Mr Dixon's whereabouts to get in touch. "Charlotte is just desperately looking for David and we need any information you can get," he said. "Please just check in hospitals in Brussels, just check that David is not one of your patients, and just let us know." Ms Sutcliffe's sister, Marie, said they were hoping to hear from a hospital or police that he had perhaps been injured but was safe. "Not everybody has been identified yet among the injured, so it's just waiting for that process to happen," she said. She plans to go out to Brussels to support her sister. "Understandably she's very, very distressed," she said. "It's just waiting, which is heartbreaking and very worrying." Mr Dixon's cousin, Philip Dixon, said his family was "fearing the worst". "He takes the Metro to work and unfortunately it's looking like he could have been on this Metro train at the time of this bombing yesterday," he said. "Charlotte tried phoning his work and he didn't turn in for work yesterday morning so we are fearing the worst at the moment." Downing Street said four Britons were confirmed to have been injured in the twin blasts which hit Zaventem airport at about 07:00 GMT and Maelbeek Metro station an hour later. So-called Islamic State (IS) has claimed responsibility for the attacks. A No 10 spokesman said: "We are concerned about one missing British national and we are in close contact with the Belgian authorities. "We are aware of four British nationals who were injured in the attacks - three are being treated in hospital, one has already been discharged. "Our embassy staff are working to assist all British nationals affected." Mr Dixon has been working as an IT contractor for securities settlement group Euroclear, which has an office a few Metro stops away from the station that was attacked. Tristan Peniston-Bird, a Euroclear spokesman, said: "We confirm that David Dixon is a contractor working for Euroclear in Brussels, who remains unaccounted for following yesterday's tragic events. "We are in touch with his partner and continue to co-ordinate with the authorities in locating David. "Our primary concern is the safety and protection of our people, and our thoughts go out to those affected by yesterday's attacks."	Friends of a computer programmer missing in Brussels since the bomb attacks in the Belgian capital have said they are desperate to find him.
Ronan Toolis led the excavation works at Trusty's Hill Fort at Gatehouse of Fleet. It unearthed evidence that it might have been the royal seat of the sixth century kingdom of Rheged. Mr Toolis said it was "pre-eminent among the kingdoms of the north" at that time. The location of Rheged had previously been thought by many historians to be in Cumbria. However, Dr Christopher Bowles, co-director of the excavation work in Dumfries and Galloway, said that may not have been the case. "The new archaeological evidence from Trusty's Hill enhances our perception of power, politics, economy and culture at a time when the foundations for the kingdoms of Scotland, England and Wales were being laid," he said. "The 2012 excavations show that Trusty's Hill was likely the royal seat of Rheged, a kingdom that had Galloway as its heartland. "This was a place of religious, cultural and political innovation whose contribution to culture in Scotland has perhaps not been given due recognition." Dr Bowles said the influence of the kingdom had "rippled through the history and literature of Scotland and beyond". Mr Toolis added that they had not been looking for Rheged when they started the excavations. "What drew us to Trusty's Hill were Pictish symbols carved on to bedrock here, which are unique in this region and far to the south of where Pictish carvings are normally found," said Mr Toolis. "The Galloway Picts Project was launched in 2012 to recover evidence for the archaeological context of these carvings. "But far from validating the existence of Galloway Picts, the archaeological context revealed by our excavation instead indicates the carvings relate to a royal stronghold and place of inauguration for the local Britons of Galloway around AD 600. "The new archaeological evidence suggests that Galloway may have been the heart of the lost Dark Age kingdom of Rheged, a kingdom that was in the late sixth century pre-eminent amongst the kingdoms of the north." The two men have produced a new book which details their findings. The Lost Dark Age Kingdom of Rheged is being launched in Gatehouse of Fleet on Saturday.	Archaeological research at a site in Galloway has suggested it may have been at the heart of a "lost kingdom" from the Dark Ages.
Spotlight: A Woman Alone With The IRA investigated the republican movement's handling of sexual abuse allegations against a suspected IRA member. Maíria Cahill waived her right to anonymity to tell how the republican movement responded to her allegations. The programme was broadcast last October. Ms Cahill claimed she was raped by a suspected IRA man when she was a teenager, and that the IRA later helped to cover up the alleged abuse. BBC Northern Ireland Director Peter Johnston said: "This is a fantastic win for our Spotlight team - particularly with a Northern Ireland story winning in the UK-wide Scoop Of The Year category. "This recognition from the Royal Television Society follows Spotlight's long tradition of making award-winning programmes and is a reflection of the dedication of our Spotlight team to produce hard-hitting, high quality investigative journalism." Jeremy Adams, Head of Television Current Affairs, BBC Northern Ireland, said it was a "tremendous achievement". "The team put a great deal of time and dedication into what was a painstaking investigation and also one of the most important and talked-about television investigations of the past year," he said. Other winners at the ceremony in the London Hilton, Park Lane, included ITV News at Ten for Daily News Programme of the Year, and Sky News for News Channel of the Year.	BBC Northern Ireland current affairs programme Spotlight has won Scoop of the Year at the Royal Television Society (RTS) journalism awards.

Alberto Paloschi gave the visitors the lead after Angel Rangel's shot fell to him via team-mate Jack Cork. Swansea goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski made a series of superb saves, before Nacer Chadli deflected in Kyle Walker's shot to equalise with 20 minutes left. Danny Rose then drove in the winner after Swansea failed to clear a corner. Hopes have been growing at White Hart Lane of a first league title since 1961, but the pressure was on to beat struggling Swansea after Leicester opened up a five-point lead with a victory over Norwich on Saturday. Mauricio Pochettino's side were utterly dominant - managing 34 shots at goal to Swansea's 10 - but were frustrated by determined defending and brilliant goalkeeping. Spurs could have forgiven for thinking it was not going to be their day, particularly when the outstanding Fabianski dived acrobatically to his right to claw out Christian Eriksen's free-kick early in the second half. Fabianski had earlier made an excellent stop to deny Harry Kane from close range, but was finally beaten as substitute Chadli struck and Rose added his first goal of the season. For Pochettino, it was a sign that his players have the character to force victories when fortune appears to be against them. Pochettino's side secured a sixth successive league victory to keep the pressure on Leicester - on a day when neighbours Arsenal lost ground with a defeat at Manchester United. The concern for Tottenham's manager is that his key players steer clear of injury as the attempt to juggle domestic demands with the Europa League. England forward Kane was patched up to play in a face mask after missing Thursday's victory over Fiorentina with a broken nose. There was concern too before kick-off as midfielder Dele Alli, an inspirational figure for them this season, turned his ankle in the warm-up. Alli was able to play the full game, but did not look at his best. Pochettino must hope that the midfielder is in better shape for Wednesday's trip to West Ham. Francesco Guidolin will have been cheered with the spirit his side showed - which was just the pick-me-up that the Swansea manager needed as he battles a chest infection. His side showed attacking guile on their occasional breaks forward, while Paloschi took his goal smartly to score for the first time since his move from Chievo in January. That came after Tottenham keeper Hugo Lloris made a superb early save to tip over Gylfi Sigurdsson's shot from six yards, and the France international was alert too late in the game to beat out another Paloschi shot. Guidolin, though will feel a sense of frustration that his team were unable to get anything from the game after leading with 20 minutes left. It means that, after four league games without victory, Swansea remain only three points above the relegation zone. Matches against Norwich, Bournemouth and Aston Villa in March will go a long way towards deciding their fate. Tottenham head coach Mauricio Pochettino: "Fabianski was great. He was man of the match. Sometimes football is difficult. You play well but find it hard to score. The good thing is that the team fight. It is a fantastic win. "Our mentality is to look to the next game and go step by step. Now we need to focus again. We have a strong squad and we will try to manage it in the right way." Media playback is not supported on this device Swansea first-team coach Alan Curtis: "Fabianski made some fantastic saves. We thought maybe it would one of those days when we would ride our luck. Lukasz kept us in the game for a long time. "We got in front and created a couple of decent opportunities but the pressure was relentless. We almost got something but it wasn't quite enough." Media playback is not supported on this device Both sides are in Premier League action on Wednesday; Swansea will stay in north London to prepare for their trip to Arsenal, while Tottenham cross the capital to visit West Ham.	Tottenham moved back to within two points of Premier League leaders Leicester after battling back from behind to beat a dogged Swansea side.
Antoine Maury was last seen in Edinburgh on Monday 24 October. The 21-year-old was last seen at Edinburgh College's Milton Road East campus at 22:00 when he suddenly left his friends. Between 22:45 and 23:00, a man matching Mr Maury's description was seen near Duddingston Village. He was topless and heading towards Holyrood Park. The Maury family said: "We are still appealing to the public for any information which can help find our son, Antoine. "We want anyone who was in the area of Duddingston, Holyrood Park or Pollock Halls, on Monday 24 October, between 22:30 and 23:30, who saw a male running and walking, to contact the police." Mr Maury is white and of medium build. He is about 6ft, with short, brown hair, a beard and a fair complexion. He has a tattoo of a bleeding hand on his forearm. When last seen he was wearing a brown/green bomber jacket with dark-coloured chinos and a white beanie hat. He is also believed to have been wearing black and white Vans trainers. Glasses belonging to Mr Maury, who suffers from poor eyesight, have since been found with some of his clothes on a golf course. Divers are still searching Duddingston Loch and there are police searches in Holyrood Park. On Saturday and Sunday about 100 volunteers joined officers in the search around Duddingston Golf Club and Holyrood High School. Police Scotland has also continued its media appeal for Mr Maury. This has resulted in more than 464,000 people being contacted through Police Scotland's Facebook page. Officers have conducted door-to-door inquiries in the Duddingston and Pollock Halls areas and have reviewed CCTV in a bid to establish Mr Maury's last known movements. Insp Alan Carson, of Police Scotland, said:  "Throughout this inquiry we have sought to provide Mr Maury's family with the answers they are desperately seeking. "We are continuing to support and work with them and I pay tribute to the dignity and courage they have shown throughout this period. "This is still a live investigation and we will carry on our search until we have exhausted our search parameters. "The public response to our appeal has been enormous and we are grateful for the support offered by the people of Edinburgh. "I would again appeal to anyone who may have information to come forward.  Even the smallest amount of information may be the key to helping us find Antoine."	Sonar equipment has been used across Duddingston Loch in the last few days in the search for a missing student.
Stella has spent a number of years travelling to a variety of countries, working as a nanny and teaching French to children. Her latest job has taken her to Saudi Arabia. "I've shot neon in a lot of locations," says Stella. "But it's the way it is used in Saudi which interested me the most. Partly because of the way it looks aesthetically in that environment - the empty roads and pitch-black desert sky give it a very stark appearance, and partly because, as Saudi friends have explained to me, it has a real cultural significance there. "Light is very spiritually important, but we also forget that it's a very young country - within any family, you'll have older generations who remember a time before they even had electricity. So now that it's arrived, there's a real love for, and status attached to, this kind of artificial light. "It feels more powerful in a country which is predominantly open desert - it's pitch dark in a lot of Saudi at night, with these vast, beautiful skies. In that environment, a neon light travels a huge distance and feels very powerful. It's like a modern version of the campfire." Stella is self-taught, having been given a camera for her 30th birthday - but she notes that once she starts to photograph a subject, she usually keeps going until she can get it out of her system before moving on to something new. And once she had noticed the neon,  she set about taking lots of pictures. "I was asking my driver in Saudi about it, and he liked the idea of my project so agreed to drive me around in the evening," she says. "I had a break when the people I worked with went for their meal to break the fast during Ramadan, so the streets were pretty empty. "That suited me, because I was more interested in looking at the actual physical geography of the place. So we went out every night, drove around until I saw something which looked right, and then we shot very quickly - there was no real set-up or off-camera lighting. It was just a case of me getting out of the car, shooting, then getting back in." Stella was also keen to avoid what she sees as the visual cliches people often fall into when photographing the country. She says: "I felt really lucky that I got to travel there and see it. I wanted to take pictures which captured how I felt when I was there, and the neon did that. I hope the photos give other people an insight into what the real country behind the headlines is like as well." NOUR by Celine Stella is published by No UFOs.

Bright neon strips of light that punctuate the dark skies of Jeddah in Saudi Arabia caught the eye of Celine Stella, who set out to photograph them whenever she had a spare moment.
But with the Foxes now languishing near the foot of the table and one hotelier claiming the impact of Richard III is slowly wearing off, is the journey over? Or is it a case of what next? Even the most upbeat of Leicester fans would probably find it difficult to be positive about their Premier League title defence as the stats make for pretty grim reading - played 19, won five, drawn five and lost nine. To put that in some context, City lost just three times in the league last season. However, Claudio Ranieri's side are through to the last 16 of the Champions League, where they will meet Sevilla for a place in the quarter finals. And after that, only the small matter of European giants such as Real Madrid, Bayern Munich and Barcelona would stand in the way of European glory... Season ticket holder Sam Webster remains quietly confident, but does not think the Foxes can go all the way in Europe. He said: "We are an unknown entity, and the bigger teams are definitely underestimating us like the big fish did in the Premier League last season. "Getting to the semis would be remarkable. However, the drastic difference between the Champions League and Premier League form is unacceptable." But even if the Foxes are not quite living up to expectations on the pitch, Richard III has helped keep the city buzzing. Amy Gray, head of tourism affairs at VisitBritain, said: "Money can't buy the publicity - the sort of publicity Leicester has got. "We saw a 17% increase in international visitors to the East Midlands for April to June. "What we've seen in Leicester is a fantastic heritage story and a fantastic sports story - and we know both are a fantastic draw to international visitors." Source: Leicester Cathedral Eloic Montagnier, general manager of Leicester's Belmont Hotel, believes interest in other Leicester destinations - such as the National Space Centre after Tim Peake's expedition - has also contributed to the city's success. He said: "We have done over 80% [occupancy] for the last year. "It was fantastic in November, with 85% occupancy for the month - it was 65% two years ago. "I think this is a great opportunity to grow the city and I think it will keep going - I don't see the success dropping off any time soon. "Football has brought a lot of people in who may never have even considered coming to Leicester." But others aren't quite so bullish about the future. Vito Ferro's San Carlo restaurant has become something of a tourist hotspot after it held a celebratory meal for the Leicester City players the day after the title was won. Despite an initial surge in bookings, Mr Ferro believes it will wear off eventually. "It is too soon to say [whether things will quieten down] because they are in the Champions League," he said. "But I would say, yes, things are eventually going to quieten down unless something else happens." So, as Leicester looks ahead to 2017, will good things come in threes with Champions League glory for the Foxes? Or will the city simply have to accept that "two out of three ain't bad"? Source: Ernst and Young	Ever since the remains of Richard III were first found under a Leicester car park in 2012, the city has enjoyed a feel-good factor that culminated this year with Leicester City completing a "fairytale" Premier League title win.
They strictly controlled the diets of 19 people so they all had exactly the same calorie intake. The results, presented at the annual meeting of the Endocrine Society, showed 67% more fat was lost on a low-fat diet than a low-carb one. But experts questioned which diets people could stick to in real life. The researchers said most dieters ended up cutting out a mixture of protein, carbohydrate and fat from their meals so the scientists set out to explore the relative contribution of each food type. It required experiments that could not be repeated outside a laboratory environment, in which the content of every meal was precisely controlled. The 19 volunteers were all obese with an average body fat percentage of 40% at the start of the trial. They spent five days on a diet designed to match how many calories their bodies were burning. It consisted of 50% carbohydrate, 35% fat and 15% protein. They then moved to the focal point of the study for the next six days, in which calorie intake was cut by 30% or around 800 calories per day. Half were placed on a low-carb diet of 30% carbohydrate, 49% fat and 21% protein. The rest were placed on a low-fat diet - 72% carbohydrate, 7% fat and 21% protein. After those six days, the participants had a couple of weeks to recover before starting all over again and trying the other diet. Their scientific presentation said: "Body fat loss was 67% greater after six days of low fat versus low carbohydrate." Dr Kevin Hall, from the NIH National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, told BBC News: "It's not easy, these folks had to eat the same meals every day. "This was very strictly controlled and they had to eat the food provided and nothing else, the diets got pretty boring pretty quickly." While providing interesting physiological insights, those comments raise concern in experts trying to help people lose weight outside strict laboratory conditions. Susan Jebb, a professor of diet and population health at the University of Oxford, told the BBC News website: "This is a neat study, but it is very small and designed to investigate the metabolism of fat and carbohydrate under highly controlled conditions, rather than longer-term weight control, where behavioural factors become increasingly important. "In 'real life', other factors such as the acceptability of the dietary programme, are likely to be an important factor associated with adherence and, for the most part, adherence over the longer term is likely to make a bigger difference to people's weight." Dr Hall said long-term forecasts were "fraught with difficulties" but said their mathematical models suggested that the low-fat diet would lead to more long-term body fat loss. The idea behind the merit of the low-fat diet is generating "fat imbalance". The low-fat, high-carb, diet does increase the amount of fat being burned by the body, but preventing the fat entering the body in the first place seemed to have greater impact. Cardiologist Dr Aseem Malhotra was concerned about the health impact of such a low-fat diet. "The total fat intake of 7% is way too low for this to be sustainable and would likely lead to nutritional deficiencies for the essential fatty acids and the fat soluble vitamins. "For the best health, even in the short term, eat real unprocessed foods, concentrate on good nutrition and stop counting calories!"	Eating a low-fat, rather than a low-carb diet leads to a greater loss of body fat, according to US National Institutes of Health scientists.
The existing system, called Greenlight, is to be replaced with a scheme called Steam Direct. Greenlight lets Steam users pledge support for games that Valve then helps appear on the service. Steam Direct will let developers get their games onto the service without first having to win over audiences to a title. In a statement setting out how Steam Direct will work, Valve said developers would be able to publish directly after they completed a sign-up process. The process will require developers to submit the same sort of information they would need to open a bank account, said Valve. In addition, it added, developers will have to pay a publishing fee. Valve said it had not yet decided how much this would be, but after consulting developers it said it  could range from $100 (Â£80) to $5000 per title. Valve said the fee would "decrease the noise in the submission pipeline" which many people interpret to mean is an attempt to discourage unscrupulous developers from submitting bad games as they have done with Greenlight. Many Steam regulars have complained that a lot of the games Greenlight shows off do not deserve publicity because they are poorly coded and derivative. Steam introduced a small fee of $100 for listing a game on Greenlight in a bid to discourage this practise. Games that become popular via Steam Direct will be able to recoup some of the fee they paid. "We want to make sure Steam is a welcoming environment for all developers who are serious about treating customers fairly and making quality gaming experiences," said Valve. Developer Mike Gale said it was not clear that Steam Direct would stop bad games being published on the service. Writing on his blog, Mr Gale said it would probably mean far more games reached Steam because "$100 - $5,000 is easier to come by than tens of thousands of votes required to pass the Greenlight system." He said the top end of the suggested fee was "not unreasonable" and was likely to be far less than many developers paid when creating console games.	Valve is changing the way independent game makers can get their creations onto its Steam service.
Lindsay Rimer, 13, was found in the Rochdale Canal five months after she disappeared in Hebden Bridge in November 1994. Despite extensive police inquiries, her killer has never been found. Kate Rimer said not knowing what happened to her little sister had been a "life sentence" for their family. Lindsay left her home in Cambridge Street at about 22:00 GMT and visited the Trades Club in Home Street. The last known sighting of her was caught on CCTV 20 minutes later as she bought cornflakes at a shop in Crown Street. Her body, which had been weighted down with a stone, was recovered about a mile upstream from the town centre. Ms Rimer, who was 20 when Lindsay went missing, hopes speaking publicly will help anyone with information to come forward. "From the beginning we have been filled with grief and we cannot stop the grief and instead, remember her with love until this comes to an end," she said. "We miss her so much but every memory of her is tainted - it is so painful and bleeds into everything we do. "It is about time this came to an end; it is a life sentence for this family." West Yorkshire Police staged a Twitter reconstruction of Lindsay's last movements in November, on the 20th anniversary of her disappearance. Det Supt Simon Atkinson said they were still looking for a "golden nugget" of information to bring the killer to justice.	The sister of a murdered schoolgirl has spoken publicly for the first time since the discovery of the teenager's body 20 years ago.
The firm's parent company, GTR, has said an offer, which includes a Â£2,000 bonus, "cannot be available indefinitely" if strikes continue. But RMT bosses said the union had already rejected the offer, and accused Southern of using "threats and bullying". A two-day strike is scheduled to begin on Friday. The latest twist in the dispute comes as Southern reinstated a full timetable after three months of reduced services. An increasingly bitter dispute has caused months of disruption for passengers, as RMT members staged a series of strikes in protest at GTR's plans to change the role of conductors on Southern services in South East England. Rail chiefs made a "full and comprehensive offer" to the RMT on 3 October in an attempt to settle the impasse over the proposed operation of driver-only trains on the network. But in a letter to RMT general secretary Mick Cash, GTR said: "Should your next planned action proceed... the offer is withdrawn in its entirety and will no longer be available for the RMT to accept." Mr Cash said in a statement: "This is just more threats and bullying from Southern rail and does nothing at all to resolve the current safety dispute. "It's also completely meaningless as the union has already rejected the Â£2,000 bribe to sell out safety, and the company are well aware of that." At the height of the dispute, in July, Southern introduced a temporary timetable to help cope with staff absences, which compounded the problems caused by the strikes. The standard service was reintroduced on Monday, although it got off to a difficult start due to a broken-down train at Crawley, while trains between Eastbourne and Hastings were hit by a signal problem. A further three blocks of strikes are planned before Christmas.	Southern Rail's latest attempt to stop strikes on its network has been branded "meaningless" by union bosses.
The Nottinghamshire golfer partnered Masters champion Danny Willett on the Sunday at Augusta, then Dustin Johnson on the final day of the US Open at Oakmont. "I hadn't had those feelings for a while, that buzz and that rush of adrenaline," Westwood said. "It was great to get them back, even if it ended in disappointment." The 43-year-old stands 39th in the world rankings. He has done well on both previous trips to Troon, finishing tied 10th in 1997 and fourth in 2004, while he came third just down the Ayrshire coast at Turnberry in 2009. The bookmakers see it differently, rating him a lot higher. He is the 12th shortest price on offer at 40-1, shorter than not only Willett but also four comparatively recent former Open winners - defending champion Zach Johnson, Ernie Els (2002 and 2012) Louis Oosthuizen (2010) and Padraig Harrington (2007 and 2008). "I feel like I'm back to the stage where I turn up fully expecting to play well, a bit like the way when I was winning for fun a few years back," said Westwood. Find out how to get into golf with our special guide. "That's down to the way I'm swinging a club, and the way I am mentally. Hiding in a darkened room and cursing my luck is never going to be my style. "After putting myself in the frame in both majors this year, I'm sure I'll be a bit more relaxed if I can get in the mix at Troon. "I've been through so many ups and downs now that nothing's ever going to faze me, and I really like the course." The former world number one continued: "I had a great weekend in 2004 when I finished 67-68 and holed a really long putt on the last on the Sunday from 35 feet. In fact, I've played well there both times the Open has been played there." Westwood has come close to victory so many times in major championships. His total of nine top-three finishes is comfortably the most of any golfer not to have won one of golf's big four events - the Masters, the US Open, the Open or the US PGA. And, on five occasions, he has had to stand by and watch mates from Chubby Chandler's same management team - Oosthuizen, Charl Schwartzel, Rory McIlroy, Darren Clarke and Willett - all win their first major. But, in three successive years, from 2011 to 2013, the Open was won by a fortysomething. Phil Mickelson was 43 when he won at Muirfield in 2013. Both Westwood's great friend Darren Clarke (at Sandwich in 2011) and Els (at Royal Lytham in 2012) were 42, while Mark O'Meara was 41 when he triumphed at Royal Birkdale in 1998. Like allowing a good claret time to mature, when it comes to finding the winner of a Claret Jug, turning 40 is clearly not the worst age to be. English golf's big hitters: Along with Westwood (39th), there are currently six other English players inside the world's top 50 all taking up their invites to Royal Troon - Yorkshiremen Willett (ninth) and Matthew Fitzpatrick (43rd), Hampshire's Justin Rose (11th), Bristol's Chris Wood (22nd), Cheltenham's Paul Casey (29th) and Nuneaton's Andy Sullivan (36th). The old-timers: Buckinghamshire's Luke Donald (15 Open appearances), Swindon's David Howell (13), Surrey's Ross Fisher (eight), Staffordshire's Robert Rock (seven) and London's Anthony Wall (six) have all been familiar figures at the Open over the past two decades. The under-exposed: London's James Morrison has only played twice, but has performed well each time (tied 23rd in 2012, tied 20th in 2015), while Southport's Tommy Fleetwood is out to better successive missed cuts in 2014 and 2015. Essex's Matt Southgate (2014) and London's Andrew Johnston (2011) both missed the cut in their one previous Open appearance. As for last week's Scottish Open runner-up Tyrrell Hatton, this will be a fifth Open in six years for the former Bucks, Berks & Oxon amateur - but the 24-year-old from Marlow, now up to 68th in the world, is yet to make the cut. The first-timers: As well as Hampshire amateur Scott Gregory, six English professionals will be making their Open debut - Lancashire's Jack Senior, London's James Heath, Merseyside's Paul Howard, Northamptonshire's Ryan Evans, Watford's Callum Shinkwin and Lincolnshire's Dave Coupland.

Lee Westwood takes his place in the field at the Open at Royal Troon having enjoyed a box seat at both of the first two majors in 2016.
In a tactical race, 24-year-old English held off European Indoor silver medallist Andreas Bube of Denmark to win in 1:49.02. Dublin runner Brian Gregan won the 400m while City of Lisburn club's Amy Foster was second in the 100m in 11.70. Ireland's eighth place in Vaasa meant they were 20th overall in Europe. That is their lowest placing in the biannual event since 2011. The League One event was won by Sweden who were promoted to the Super League alongside hosts Finland and Switzerland.	Donegal's Mark English won the 800 metres as Ireland finished eighth in League One of the European Team Championships in Finland.
Mae gan Gymru a rhannau eraill o'r DU rai o'r cyfraddau goresgyn canser gwaethaf yn y byd datblygedig. Nawr mae cynllun peilot yng Nghwm Cynon a Chastell-nedd yn canolbwyntio ar gleifion mae eu meddygon teulu yn amau sydd â chanser ond ddim yn dangos unrhyw arwyddion neu symptomau brys. Daw hyn flwyddyn ar ôl i feddygon ymweld â Denmarc er mwyn gweld y systemau diagnostig yno. Fe welodd swyddogion Bwrdd Iechyd Cwm Taf bod y gwasanaeth iechyd yn Nenmarc wedi gwella cyfraddau goresgyn canser. Y pryder yw bod claf yng Nghymru sydd ddim gyda symptomau clir yn disgwyl am gyfnod rhy hir am ddiagnosis, am nad ydyn nhw yn "ffitio'n hawdd" i unrhyw lwybr triniaeth benodol. Mae'n golygu bod meddygon teulu yn cyfeirio'r claf yn ôl ac ymlaen er mwyn cael nifer o brofion, a hynny yn cymryd sawl wythnos. Oherwydd hyn, yr ofn yw bod gormod o gleifion yn dechrau triniaeth pan mae eu canser wedi datblygu neu nad oes modd ei wella. Bydd 40 o feddygon yng Nghwm Cynon sydd yn credu efallai bod rhywbeth o'i le yn gallu cyfeirio'r claf at ganolfan ddiagnostig yn Ysbyty Brenhinol Morgannwg, Llantrisant o fewn saith diwrnod. Yr amcangyfrif yw y bydd rhyw chwe chlaf yr wythnos yn cael eu gweld ac yn cael profion gwahanol, a'r gobaith yw bod hyn yn digwydd ar yr un diwrnod. Ar hyn o bryd dim ond 35% o gleifion sydd â symptomau sydd yn "peri pryder" sy'n cael diagnosis yn ardal Cwm Taf. Mae meddygon felly eisiau cyrraedd y mwyafrif o'r cleifion sydd heb symptomau mor amlwg o'r clefyd yn gynt. Bydd clinig tebyg yn cael ei sefydlu yn Ysbyty Castell-nedd Port Talbot fel rhan o gynllun prawf arall gan Fwrdd Iechyd Abertawe Bro Morgannwg. Mae'r treialon wedi eu datblygu yn ystod y 12 mis ers i arbenigwyr o Gymru ddychwelyd o Aarhus. Fe aeth Denmarc ati i sefydlu'r canolfannau diagnostig wedi pryderon bod y wlad ar ei hôl hi o ran cyfraddau goresgyn canser. Yn ôl Dr Gareth Davies, Cyfarwyddwr Cyswllt Rhwydwaith Canser Cymru, bydd y cynllun yn tawelu meddwl claf ond hefyd yn cyflymu'r broses. "Os yw'r meddyg teulu yn gweld claf a ddim yn siŵr beth sydd o'i le ond yn pryderu ac yn teimlo bod rhywbeth o'i le, bydd yn rhoi cyfle i'r meddyg teulu gyfeirio'r claf yn syth i'r clinig ac yn golygu bydd y claf yn cael ei weld yn gyflym a gobeithio yn cael diagnosis." Mae Gareth Jordan, meddyg teulu yn Aberdâr, yn dweud y gallai'r cynllun peilot wneud gwahaniaeth mawr i fywydau'r cleifion. "Mi fyddai gallu dweud, 'Dwi wedi gweld y gŵr yma, mae wedi colli llawer o bwysau... allai ddim ei anfon i ffwrdd i gael profion arbenigol neu pe bydden ni fyddai'r profion yn cael eu rhoi yn nhrefn tebygolrwydd'. "Ond mae'r ffaith eu bod nhw'n cael eu gweld mewn un lle a phob un yn gweld cynnydd cyflym, y tebygrwydd ydy diagnosis cynnar os oes ganddyn nhw ganser yn fy marn i." Os bydd cynllun peilot Cwm Cynon - fydd yn para chwe mis - yn llwyddiannus, bydd gweddill byrddau iechyd yr ardal yn cynnig yr un gwasanaeth yn y misoedd wedyn.	Mae arbenigwyr canser yn gobeithio y bydd cynllun newydd, fydd yn cael ei dreialu yn ne Cymru, yn lleihau'r amser mae'n cymryd i gael diagnosis o'r clefyd.

His left-wing Social Democrat party (PSD) had accused him of failing to carry out necessary economic reforms. The prime minister was involved in a power struggle with party leader Liviu Dragnea, who was barred from office after a conviction for voter fraud. Mr Grindeanu lost the censure motion by 241 votes to 10. The decision by his own party and its liberal ALDE allies to oust him was seen as a first, even for Romania's turbulent politics. For the motion to pass they needed a parliamentary majority of 233 votes. The PSD won elections in December only a year after losing power. Within weeks, protests erupted across the country over a decree seen as weakening anti-corruption measures in one of the European Union's most corrupt member states. In February the EU warned the government in Bucharest against "backtracking" in its efforts against corruption. Although Mr Grindeanu withdrew the decree, the crisis weakened the new government and soured relations between the prime minister and Mr Dragnea. Mr Dragnea criticised his rival's performance in government on Wednesday, accusing him of failing to push through "the most ambitious programme since 1989". Some commentators have argued that his removal was more about relaxing measures aimed at tackling corruption. Mr Dragnea, while being the power behind the left-wing party's throne, cannot take power because he was given a suspended jail term for vote rigging and also faces trial for alleged abuse of office. His first choice as prime minister, Sevil Shhaideh, was turned down by President Klaus Iohannis in December. A new nominee from the ruling coalition will also have to be approved by the president. Far from being the sick man of Europe, Romania's economy is showing the highest growth in the EU, at 5.6% in the year to March 2017. However, its justice system has been under EU scrutiny ever since the country joined in 2007. In its most recent report this year, the EU's executive praised Romania's anti-corruption agency (DNA) but warned that the fight against corruption was under serious threat from political and media attack.	Romanian Prime Minister Sorin Grindeanu has been forced from power after only six months by his own party, in a no-confidence vote in parliament.
He is among thousands of Burmese Tamils living in the north-eastern Indian town of Moreh in Manipur state, which borders Myanmar, also known as Burma. Mr Sarlan and other Indian-origin people were forced to leave the country following a military coup in the 1960s. Their businesses were nationalised and Mr Sarlan, who used to live in Rangoon (now called Yangon), and others became penniless refugees overnight. It is estimated that nearly 300,000 Indians fled the country following the coup. "After we reached India, for the first three months we were living in a refugee camp in the southern state of Tamil Nadu. Though Tamil Nadu was the land of our forefathers, it was difficult to live there without any support," recalls Mr Sarlan, 74, who is now a social activist. 'Mini-India' Indians lived in Burma for centuries, but large-scale migration took place during British-colonial rule, when the country was part of British India, during the 19th and early 20th centuries. They were used as civil servants, traders, farmers, labourers and artisans - and came to be considered the backbone of the economy. Burmese nationalists always viewed them with suspicion and there were a series of anti-Indian riots in the 1930s. Once the British left in 1948, Indian-origin people became increasingly vulnerable and they were swiftly forced to leave following the 1962 coup. They found it difficult to settle in India, so many decided to return to Burma by land. They vaguely knew that India's north-eastern states of Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram and Arunachal Pradesh shared a border with Burma. After weeks of travelling by train and bus a small group managed to reach Moreh, around 3,200km (2,000 miles) by road from Tamil Nadu. When they reached the border crossing, Burmese soldiers prevented them from entering the country. The Tamils settled in Moreh hoping one day to return to their homeland - but those dreams have never been fulfilled. "Moreh was a tribal village when we first came here. There was hardly any infrastructure at that point. But many Burmese people came to Moreh looking for Indian goods like automobile parts, clothing and cosmetics. Since we knew the Burmese language it was easy for us to start businesses," Mr Sarlan recalls. Soon, the Tamils in Moreh invited their relatives and friends from camps in Tamil Nadu and elsewhere to join them. Many went on to become Indian citizens. By the 1990s the number of Burmese Tamils in Moreh had increased to about 15,000, almost half of the town's population. They had set up their own schools, temples, churches and mosques - and celebrated their cultural festivals with fervour. Moreh was described as a "mini-India". "We still retain lots of cultural and social links with Tamil Nadu state. For our important temple festivals we bring priests and music performers from there. Many parents in Moreh also send their children to schools in Tamil Nadu," says K Balasubramaniam, who is the principal of a local secondary school. Chinese goods At one point, Burmese Tamils dominated local border trade and that led to resentment from the Kuki community and others. Several people were killed in bloody clashes between Tamils and Kukis in 1995, but relations have improved since then. "We take part in each other's cultural and religious festivals. We have several committees to look into any problems and they get sorted out immediately," says Manohar Mohan, a Tamil businessman. Tamil businesses suffered a setback after the Burmese government established a market just inside their border in Namphalong in the mid-1990s. Chinese products flooded in and many Burmese started shopping in Namphalong rather than Moreh. Traders in Manipur also faced threats from insurgents in the state - some of the businessmen who refused to pay "extortion money" were shot dead. The violence and lack of business opportunities forced many traders and Burmese Indians to leave Moreh, many opting for Chennai. Now Moreh's Tamil population is just 3,500. 'Gateway' The insurgency has been contained to a large extent in the last few years. Many traders in Moreh hope the town will regain its business importance once the long-pending Asian Highway, linking the state capital Imphal with Yangon and Bangkok materialises. Moreh is considered to be India's gateway to South East Asia and locals believe because of its unique geography the place offers tremendous potential. The story of the town's Burmese Tamils is one of suffering and resilience as well as achievement. Many elderly Tamils, originally from Burma, are nostalgic and want to stay in Moreh, as it is closer to where they come from.  But later generations say the town offers little in terms of education and employment. "If we don't have the right education facilities then we have to go elsewhere. We can't do higher studies here. Also, girls can get only teaching jobs here in Moreh. So there are no other options but to leave this town and go to a place like Chennai," says B Revathy, a university student. Emotional attachment it seems may not be enough for Moreh to keep its Burmese Tamils.

The home side almost went behind when Charlie Austin went close with two headers and hit the post with a shot. Austin was also through on goal in the second half but an ambitious chip was saved by keeper Kasper Schmeichel. Jamie Vardy had Leicester's best chance after a poor backpass but he was tackled by Oriol Romeu, who also blocked two follow-up shots. The Foxes have now won only two of their opening seven leagues games, collecting eight points. Relive all the action and reaction to Sunday's games Leicester are now unbeaten in 19 Premier League home games since a defeat by Arsenal in September 2015 but that record would have been ended if Southampton's finishing had been more clinical. The Foxes had gone into the game following another impressive win in the Champions League - 1-0 over Porto on Tuesday - but they failed to replicate that form, with the visitors having the better chances as the home side managed just one shot on target. Vardy had the type of opening he relishes when he ran on to Virgil van Dijk's poor backpass but he tried to round keeper Fraser Forster and gave Romeu enough time to get back and tackle him. The two shots in the aftermath from Islam Slimani and Vardy, who has failed to score in six games, were also blocked by the Southampton midfielder. An effort that came from a clutch of bodies following a Christian Fuchs cross almost crept in at Forster's near post and Shinji Okazaki nodded just wide but, whether it was because of their Champions League exertions in midweek, the Foxes rarely carried the threat that won them the top-flight title last season. Southampton's build-up to the game had been overshadowed by assistant manager Eric Black being named in a Daily Telegraph investigation into corruption in football and a seven-hour delay in their return from a Europa League tie in Israel on Thursday. But manager Claude Puel made seven changes for the game at the King Power, and they started strongly as Austin had one header saved and glanced another wide before seeing an acute-angled shot coming back off the far post. Austin had scored five goals in four games going into the match and should have added to that tally when he was through on goal in the second half only to go for a difficult chip over Schmeichel, which was saved. Their main concerns at the back came from their own mistakes, especially Van Dijk's weak backpass, but they comfortably kept their sixth successive clean sheet in all competitions. Leicester manager Claudio Ranieri: "I'm very happy because Southampton deserved to win. They played better. We conceded too many chances to score a goal. "I recognise they played better than us. Fortunately we finished with a draw from the match." On playing Champions League games in midweek: "Everything is a new experience. Now I have to decide whether to give a rest to players." Media playback is not supported on this device Southampton boss Claude Puel: "We had the possibilities to win the game.

The McLaren driver was already not going to race in F1 in 2017, with the team holding an option on him for the 2018 campaign. But speaking on Thursday, the 36-year-old Briton said: "I go into this weekend thinking it's going to be my last race. I think that's the best way. "At this moment in time, I don't want to be racing in F1 beyond this year." Button, world champion in 2009, made his debut at the age of 20 in 2000. Sunday's race will be his 305th grand prix start, with only Rubens Barrichello (322) and Michael Schumacher (306) having driven in more. He has won 15 F1 races, driving for Williams, Benetton, Renault, BAR, Honda, Brawn and McLaren. Belgian Stoffel Vandoorne is replacing Button at McLaren next year as team-mate to two-time world champion Fernando Alonso, whose contract runs out at the end of 2017, with Button acting as an ambassador for the team. "It is true that I have a contract in 2018 but, at this moment in time, I am not going to be racing in 2018," Button added. "The whole point of this [contract for 2018] was if, in three months' time, I had eaten myself stupid and I changed my mind. "But I don't want to go into this race thinking it's not my last race - and it is." Under his contract for 2017, Button is due to be McLaren's reserve driver and would race if either Alonso or Vandoorne are unable to for any reason. Media playback is not supported on this device He will do promotional work for McLaren and some work in the simulator and attend a minimum of four grands prix. "It's been a long journey since eight years old until now," Button added. "You get to Formula 1 with many dreams and hopefully you leave the sport with memories - some amazing memories, some life-changing, some good, some bad. To walk away with the world championship is very special, too. "I will definitely step away from F1 happy with what I've achieved and definitely my life starts now."	Former world champion Jenson Button says he will retire from Formula 1 after Sunday's Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
Djokovic won 6-3 7-5 in a largely commanding performance. The 29-year-old, who has now won seven titles this year, has beaten the Japanese on nine successive occasions. Djokovic, who was beaten in the third round at Wimbledon by Sam Querrey, will represent Serbia at the Rio Olympics. "I don't need to explain that every athlete dreams of being a part of the Olympic Games," he said. "I'm competing in singles and doubles. "Hopefully I'll get at least one medal."	World number one Novak Djokovic won his first title since his surprise exit from Wimbledon with a straight-sets win over Japan's Kei Nishikori in the final of the Rogers Cup in Toronto.
Since 2014 Libya has had two rival parliaments - an Islamist-backed one in Tripoli and an internationally recognised government in the east. However, several MPs on both sides of the divide have described the latest announcement as premature. Both parliaments must back the deal. UN envoy Bernardino Leon told a news conference in Morocco that Fayez Sarraj would be nominated as prime minister. Abdulsalam Bilashahir, of the Tripoli-based General National Congress (GNC), told the BBC: "We are not a part of this [proposed] government. It means nothing to us and we were not consulted." Ibrahim Alzaghiat, of the House of Representatives (HoR), based in Tobruk, said: "This proposed government will lead to the division of Libya and will turn it into a joke. Mr Leon's choice was unwise." MPs from rival camps appear to be finding rare common ground over their dismissal of the UN proposal, saying it is premature. The rival parliaments have not even accepted the political agreement that embodies the proposed unity government, so announcing the names appeared rushed. The UN pushed for it because there were still objections to the wider deal and mediators worried that talks would collapse. But there is a danger that this latest move will backfire. Civilians are frustrated with the dangerous and chaotic realities ruling their lives. It is unlikely they are waking up more hopeful today. Why is Libya lawless? Who wants what in Libya? However, Mr Leon said he believed that the list of proposed ministers for the unity body "can work". Speaking in the Moroccan city of Skhirat, where the talks have been taking place, Mr Leon said: "After a year of work in this process, after working with more than 150 Libyan personalities from all the regions, finally the moment has come in which we can propose a national unity government," "All of them will work as a team," he added. Other posts in the proposed government include three deputies for the prime minister to represent Libya's east, west and south. One of the proposed deputy prime ministers, Mussa al-Kouni, said: "The hardest part has just begun." A loose alliance of militias, including Islamists, seized the capital, Tripoli, in August 2014 and reinstated the GNC, forcing the existing and internationally recognised government to flee to the eastern city of Tobruk. Libya's politicians have faced increasing pressure from the West to reach agreement on a unity government. Libya has suffered years of unrest since the overthrow of dictator Muammar Gaddafi in 2011. The violence and political chaos have allowed Islamist militants to gain ground in Libya and also seen human traffickers use the Libyan coast to send tens of thousands of migrants across the Mediterranean to Europe.	The United Nations envoy for Libya has proposed the formation of a national unity government, after months of difficult talks.
The Lions looked the more dangerous side in the early stages and experienced striker Steve Morison twice hammered efforts over the crossbar. There was little goalmouth action at either end until Millwall broke the deadlock in the 35th minute. Morison helped on a free-kick from Tony Craig and central defender Byron Webster fired a shot on the turn from 15 yards into the bottom corner of the net. Shrewsbury almost equalised early in the second half but visiting right-back Mahlon Romeo's clearance from Shaun Whalley's cross just went over the bar. Millwall doubled their advantage in the 77th minute, Shaun Hutchinson turning in the loose ball from close range after Shrewsbury were unable to clear Shane Ferguson's free-kick. Shrewsbury, now without a win in six games, grabbed a late consolation when Whalley, set up by Stephen Humphrys, squeezed a shot past goalkeeper Tom King. Millwall are now only outside the play-off places on goal difference while Shrewsbury remain in the relegation zone. Match report supplied by the Press Association.

The company insists it is still committed to launching the smart glasses as a consumer product, but will stop producing Glass in its present form. Instead it will focus on "future versions of Glass" with work carried out by a different division to before. The Explorer programme, which gave software developers the chance to buy Glass for $1,500 (Â£990) will close. The programme was launched in the United States in 2013. It was then opened up to anyone and was launched in the UK last summer. It had been expected that it would be followed reasonably quickly by a full consumer launch. From next week, the search firm will stop taking orders for the product but it says it will continue to support companies that are using Glass. The Glass team will also move out of the Google X division which engages in "blue sky" research, and become a separate undertaking, under its current manager Ivy Ross. She and the Glass team will report to Tony Fadell, the chief executive of the home automation business Nest, acquired by Google a year ago. He said the project had "broken ground and allowed us to learn what's important to consumers and enterprises alike" and he was excited to be working with the team "to integrate those learnings into future products". Google says it is committed to working on the future of the product, but gave no timescale for the launch of any new version. The Glass project received the enthusiastic backing of Google's co-founder Sergey Brin. He presided over a spectacular unveiling which saw skydivers jump out of an aircraft wearing Glass and beam what they were seeing to a conference in San Francisco. Early users of Glass were very excited about the product, which enabled them get information in a small screen above their right eye, take photos and videos, and get directions. The technology blogger Robert Scoble said he could not now imagine living a day without the product, and was even photographed wearing it in the shower. But he and others soon tired of Glass, complaining that it was not evolving in the ways that had been promised. There were also concerns about privacy and safety, with some bars and restaurants banning the use of the smart glasses on their premises. Other companies have launched smart glasses and various other forms of wearable technology. But no single product has yet proved the major hit that technology companies are looking for as they seek out the next big thing. Google has tried to present this announcement as just another step in the evolution of an amazing innovation. But make no mistake - Google Glass is dead, at least in its present form. As I found when I spent a couple of months wearing Glass, it has a number of really useful aspects - in particular the camera. There is however one huge disadvantage - it makes its users look daft, and that meant that it was never going to appeal to a wide audience. But Google will now have to deal with a disgruntled community of Explorers who paid a large sum for a device which they must have believed would eventually evolve into something more useful. The Glass team can at least continue its work out of the spotlight without the pressure of deadlines. Tony Fadell, the former Apple designer Google acquired with his smart thermostat firm Nest, will oversee the future of the product. Both he and the Glass team leader Ivy Ross, who has come from the fashion world, will know that form as well as function will have to be at the centre of any successful piece of wearable technology.	Google is ending sales of its Google Glass eyewear.
Belmont, a Grade II* listed building in Lyme Regis, has been restored following eight years of research and two years of restoration work by the Landmark Trust charity. It was owned in the 18th Century by Eleanor Coade, who built up a successful artificial stone business. The building will open to the public on Saturday and Sunday. Dr Anna Keay, director of the Landmark Trust, said the rejuvenated building was "a fitting monument to the genius of Eleanor Coade". She added: "Visitors will now be able to stay in her Georgian architectural gem and in so doing experience the beauty and peace that inspired one of our greatest modern writers, John Fowles." Belmont was Fowles's home for almost four decades from 1968, and it was where he completed his classic novel The French Lieutenant's Woman. The Landmark Trust's craftspeople have recreated any damaged or missing items at their studio in the Cotswolds, such as fireplaces, architraves, shutters and skirting boards. Coade stone was a ceramic, synthetic stone that was first produced during the 18th Century. Like the trust's other 195 buildings, Belmont will be let out for short breaks.	A Georgian seaside villa in Dorset, where author John Fowles lived, will open its doors after a £1.8m revamp.
Pro-EU centrist Emmanuel Macron made the comments as he and his far-right rival Marine Le Pen held rallies in the last week of campaigning. French voters go to the polls on Sunday to decide between the two. At a rally in a suburb of Paris, Ms Le Pen has meanwhile accused Mr Macron of being merely more of the same. Ms Le Pen has capitalised on anti-EU feeling, and has promised a referendum on France's membership. France is braced for mass May Day rallies. Five big unions have urged their members not to vote for Le Pen, though three have stopped short of backing Macron. % Emmanuel  Macron % Marine  Le Pen Please enable Javascript to view our poll of polls chart. Last updated  April 25, 2017 The polling average line  looks at the five most recent national polls and takes the median value, ie, the value between the two figures that are higher and two figures that are lower. "I'm a pro-European, I defended constantly during this election the European idea and European policies because I believe it's extremely important for French people and for the place of our country in globalisation," Mr Macron, leader of the recently created En Marche! movement, told the BBC. "But at the same time we have to face the situation, to listen to our people, and to listen to the fact that they are extremely angry today, impatient and the dysfunction of the EU is no more sustainable. "So I do consider that my mandate, the day after, will be at the same time to reform in depth the European Union and our European project." Mr Macron added that if he were to allow the EU to continue to function as it was would be a "betrayal". "And I don't want to do so," he said. "Because the day after, we will have a Frexit or we will have [Ms Le Pen's] National Front (FN) again." The 39-year-old is leading in the polls by 20 percentage points, and will try to win over more voters when he speaks in north-east Paris later. Ms Le Pen, 48, has been holding her rally in the working-class Paris suburb of Villepinte. Referring to Mr Macron's period as a minister in President Hollande's government, she accused him of being a "candidate of continuity... littered with the corpses of jobs transferred off-shore, the ruins of bust businesses, and the gaping holes of deficit and debt". Ms Le Pen has won support in rural and former industrial areas by promising to retake control of France's borders from the EU and slash immigration. Earlier, her estranged father - FN founder Jean-Marie Le Pen - attended a march from the statue of Joan of Arc, a long-time FN icon. The 88-year-old was kicked out of the FN by his daughter two years ago for repeatedly calling the Holocaust a "detail of history" - remarks which were preventing Marine Le Pen from putting distance between the party and its past links with anti-Semitism. Sunday was France's national day of remembrance for the French Jews who were deported to Nazi Germany during the Second World War. Mr Macron visited Paris's Holocaust memorial to pay his respects, while Ms Le Pen laid a wreath at the World War Two monument in Marseille. But the war remains a difficult area for Ms Le Pen. She suggested earlier this month France was not responsible for a 1942 wartime round-up of 13,000 Jews, who were sent from France to Nazi death camps. Meanwhile, Jean-FranÃ§ois Jalkh - the man she named as interim president of the FN while she campaigned - was forced to step down on Tuesday amid claims he had questioned the reality of Nazi gas chambers, which is a crime under French law. He denies wrongdoing.	The front-runner in the French presidential election has told the BBC that the EU must reform or face the prospect of "Frexit".
Jodie Whittaker was announced as Doctor Who's 13th Time Lord - the first woman to be given the role. She will make her debut on the show when the Doctor regenerates in the Christmas special. The actor Martin Landau (left), star of 1960s TV series Mission: Impossible, died at the age of 89. He won an Oscar in 1995 for portraying the horror movie star Bela Lugosi in Ed Wood. The film-maker George A Romero, who created the Living Dead movie franchise, also died at the age of 77. Many credit him for inventing the zombie genre that we see in horror films today. Game of Thrones returned for its seventh season. Fans and critics were very happy - though they weren't too pleased with Ed Sheeran's cameo as an unnamed singing soldier. Buzzfeed published a report accusing singer R Kelly of trapping six women in a sex "cult". He denied the allegations and his lawyer said he would work "diligently and forcibly to pursue his accusers and clear his name". The salaries of 96 of the BBC's biggest stars were revealed for the first time in the corporation's annual report. Only a third of the stars earning more than Â£150,000 a year were women - a statistic director general Tony Hall said highlighted a need to "go further and faster" on gender issues. Luis Fonsi's Despacito became the most-streamed song of all time within just six months of its release. The hit single has been played 4.6 billion times, overtaking Justin Bieber's Sorry. Linkin Park lead singer Chester Bennington died aged 41. The singer is said to have struggled with alcohol and drug abuse and had talked in the past about contemplating suicide.

In a strongly worded letter to all teachers, Gavin Boyd also said they got better pay than their counterparts in England and Wales. Teaching unions are refusing to co-operate with school inspections in a dispute over pay and workload. Some are also taking occasional strike action. The National Association of Schoolmasters and Women Teachers (NASUWT) has reacted angrily to Mr Boyd's letter, accusing him of "fake news". Mr Boyd is chief executive of the Education Authority and represents the teaching employers in negotiations over the current pay dispute. He wrote that the industrial action was "seriously affecting the education of children and young people" and "the effective operation of schools". He also said teachers had been "confused by misinformation" on a number of issues. "The average teacher's pay in Northern Ireland is just over Â£40,000 per annum," he added. "This compares very favourably with other graduate professions locally and is actually higher than the average teacher's pay in England and Wales." He said that teaching unions had rejected an overall offer of 2.5% on pay in 2015-16. "There have been no reductions in teacher's pay," he said. Mr Boyd conceded that national insurance and pension contributions had risen, but said these were "part of a wider government strategy to ensure public sector pensions remain affordable and sustainable". "Public sector pensions remain attractive and in general offer much better terms than those available in the private sector." However, the NASUWT's general secretary Chris Keates said his letter would infuriate teachers. "Teachers will not be persuaded or intimidated by the fake news presented in the letter," she said. "The value of teachers' pay has fallen by around 20% since 2010. "The employers should start to devote more of their time to addressing the genuine concerns of teachers rather than peddling misinformation." The letter will not help to resolve disputes between teachers and their employers, said Heather Watson, the principal of Phoenix Integrated Primary School in Cookstown, County Tyrone. She was "shocked, confused and disappointed" when she received the letter. "It hasn't done anything to reassure teachers that they are respected and valued," said Ms Watson. "I understand that there are two sides to this, but I really want the two sides to get their act together and address the issues." Jim Clarke, the chief executive of the Council for Catholic Maintained Schools, which represents teachers' employers, said the information in the letter was "factually accurate". "It might not necessarily agree with everyone's perspective but all we can do is present the facts as they are," he added. In a related development, the Irish National Teachers' Organisation (INTO) has accused the Department of Education of "attempts at bullying" by writing to a Catholic archbishop about the ongoing industrial action. In a letter to members, INTO said that the Department of Education's permanent secretary Derek Baker had written to Archbishop Eamon Martin. They said Mr Baker had requested that Archbishop Martin ensures that school governors co-operate with school inspections. "Attempts at bullying, such as this, should be rejected as an unsubtle attempt to bring the action to an end," they wrote. However, in a statement to the BBC, the department responded by describing the claim as "utter nonsense". "The letter focuses exclusively on the statutory duty placed on governors in respect of safeguarding and promoting the welfare of pupils and seeks their cooperation with the ETI specifically in respect of child protection and safeguarding," they said. "The suggestion that the department's letter amounts to bullying is utter nonsense".	Northern Ireland's top education official has accused teachers of harming children's education by taking industrial action.
The Ibrox club ripped up its contract with Mr Ashley after it was alleged Rangers only received about 7p in every Â£1 spent on club products. Mr Ashley claimed the deal, struck with former Rangers chief executive Charles Green, was wrongly terminated. He took his case to the High Court in London where it has been agreed his litigation can continue. Deputy High Court judge Richard Millett issued a written ruling after hearing competing arguments. The judge gave no date for the next hearing. In May, Rangers' directors said they were going to rip up contracts held with a merchandise company, Rangers Retail, which they ran with a Sports Direct firm. Rangers chairman Dave King, who took control nearly two years ago, and other directors were unhappy with the arrangement. William McCormick QC, who led the Rangers legal team, told Judge Millett supporters were also upset. He said fans became angry after learning the club only got about 7p of every Â£1 spent and had staged a merchandise boycott. Mr McCormick said fans thought Mr Ashley, who owns Newcastle United FC, pocketed too much of their money. He said there was a widespread view that no "self-respecting" Rangers supporter wore a replica shirt.	Sports Direct owner Mike Ashley has won the latest round of a legal fight with Rangers over a merchandise deal.
Mr Poots made the comments on the BBC's Nolan Live on Wednesday night. Speaking to Sinn Féin's Alex Maskey, Mr Poots said: "We'll do business with you because it's in the interests of Northern Ireland. "We have peace in Northern Ireland, so we'll hold our noses and do business with you." He added: "I do not like doing business with Sinn Féin. I hold my nose about what has gone on in the past, about the activities of the IRA over 25 years, of the murders that took place and there's a stench that still rises from that in many homes across Northern Ireland." Mr Maskey said the comments had shown Mr Poots in his "true colours" However, speaking on the BBC's Good Morning Ulster on Thursday, Mr Poots said "many people across Northern Ireland find it appalling that Sinn Féin are in government". "They have an association with the IRA, who committed over 2,000 murders in Northern Ireland, and that's something that's very hard for all of us to accept, but we do it because we want to ensure there aren't thousands more people lose their lives as the result of Troubles in Northern Ireland in the years to come," he said. "Whenever I look across the benches at Stormont, I see people who have been charged and convicted and served lengthy prison sentences for the most heinous of crimes, and that is not the case for republicans. "I work with those people because they have got a mandate, but that doesn't mean I have to like it." Speaking on the Nolan Show, the DUP's Simon Hamilton said he "understood entirely" what Mr Poots had meant. "I think my generation maybe didn't suffer as much as others did during the Troubles in Northern Ireland, but that doesn't mean that I don't forget what the IRA did," he said. "But I have a family of my own now and I don't want them to grow up into the sort of Northern Ireland that many people had to live through in the 70s and 80s and because of that I'm prepared to work with, and my party is prepared to work with, Sinn Féin who have a mandate from the electorate. "I know what Edwin meant when he talked about a stench and it is that legacy of violence, IRA violence, down through the 70s and 80s and into the 90s that left a lot of people dead, left a lot of people injured." Mr Hamilton, the health minister, has come under criticism recently over the DUP's policy of keeping its ministers in office for only a few hours each week while talks continue to resolve the current Stormont crisis. Asked about his position, he said he would resume his duties for one day next week.	The DUP's Edwin Poots has defended comments he made that party members have to hold their noses when doing business with Sinn Féin.
Richard Duffy fired Vale in front after Neil Collins headed down a corner for the defender to coolly latch onto. Scunthorpe's Paddy Madden could have levelled later on but fired the ball over the crossbar from close range. But Wootton's late goal rescued a point and prevented the visitors from taking their first win in eight games. The Iron remain in 17th, a point above 18th-placed Vale who are three points above the League One relegation zone. Scunthorpe manager Mark Robins told BBC Radio Humberside: Media playback is not supported on this device "We were by no means at our best tonight but we've created enough chances to win the game. "We gave them one shot at goal and they scored. "The changes we made had an impact no doubt about that - I told Kyle (Wooten) to go make a name for himself which he has thankfully gone and done."	A dramatic injury-time equaliser from teenage substitute Kyle Wootton gifted Scunthorpe a point against relegation rivals Port Vale.
The original film saw Tom Hanks play a man saved from drowning as a boy by a mermaid, whom he meets 20 years later. Tatum - who will presumably be a merman - is set to co-star with Jillian Bell, according to Hollywood Reporter. They starred in 2014's undercover cop comedy film 22 Jump Street, which topped the box office on its release. The original film's director Ron Howard is set to produce the film, along with Tatum. The film, a rom-com about whether the man will choose to remain on land or join the mermaid in the sea, was nominated for an Oscar for best original screenplay. This version will be written by Maris Lewis-Ryan and follows on from Ghostbusters, which was remade this year with an all-female lead cast. Tatum recently starred in Hail Caesar! with George Clooney and Josh Brolin, while Bell is to appear in Office Christmas Party later this year.	Magic Mike star Channing Tatum is to play the mermaid in a remake of 1984's film Splash, taking the role played by Darryl Hannah, according to reports.
The Stornoway-registered Louisa sank on 9 April as it lay at anchor in calm seas off Mingulay in the Western Isles. An investigation by the Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB) found the lifejackets the men were wearing did not function as they should have done. The probe also highlighted a delay in the rescue effort. The bodies of Chris Morrison, 27, from Harris, and Martin Johnstone, 29, from Halkirk, Caithness, were recovered following the sinking. The body of skipper Paul Alliston, 42, from Lewis, was lost during a lifeboat crew's attempts to recover him and remains missing. Only Lachlann Armstrong, 27, from Stornoway, Lewis, survived after swimming ashore. The MAIB said the men who died in the incident were wearing approved lifejackets, but the survival aids did not work as would have been expected. An urgent review of lifejacket testing protocols by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) has been recommended by the MAIB in a newly-published report of its investigation. Chief Inspector of Marine Accidents Steve Clinch said: "A lifejacket should turn an unconscious person onto their back and keep their airway clear of the water. "It is therefore of concern that the skipper and two crew were tragically found unresponsive and face down in their lifejackets when the rescue services arrived on scene. "The results of lifejacket trials undertaken by the MAIB and of lifejacket testing commissioned by the MCA following the accident strengthen that concern. "Therefore, as a matter of urgency, I am recommending the MCA to conduct further research to confirm or otherwise the suitability of historical and extant lifejacket water performance test protocols." The Louisa had been anchored close to shore in Mingulay Bay. The skipper and crew, who had been working long hours before anchoring late the previous evening, were asleep onboard, said the MAIB. Investigators believe the boat's deck wash hose flooded the hold and the crew were woken by the Louisa "sinking rapidly". The four men escaped to the aft deck, activated the boat's emergency position indicating radio beacon (EPIRB) and put on lifejackets. However, they were unable to inflate the liferaft as they abandoned the vessel. Louisa's EPIRB was detected and the coastguard was alerted. But the MAIB said "confusion over terminology resulted in delays before search and rescue units were sent to the scene". The investigation of the incident involved raising the wreck of the crab boat and taking it to Clydebank. A spokeswoman for the MCA said: "This is a deeply tragic incident and our thoughts remain with the families of these fishermen, who've suffered a terrible loss. "Saving lives at sea is our highest priority, and we strive to ensure that our search and rescue techniques are  continually reviewed in order to deliver an effective and efficient emergency response." She added: "The MCA is continuing to collaborate with the MAIB on the contents of this report in order to address the recommendations put forward." A spokesman for Louisa fishing vessel owners, Duncan and Murdo Kennedy, said: "The tragic events of 9 April 2016 resulted in the loss of three fine fisherman and our thoughts remain with the families of Martin Johnstone, Chris Morrison, Paul Alliston and surviving crew member, Lachlan Armstrong. "We have fully cooperated with the MAIB inquiry and are committed to implementing the report's recommendations. We hope the wider issues raised in the report will lead to improved safety for all those working at sea and prevent any similar incident from happening."	An urgent review of how lifejackets are tested has been recommended following the deaths of the skipper and two crew of a crab boat that sank last year.
The 29-year-old, who carded a round of 59 in January, began the final round with a four-stroke lead. But he put his tee shot into the water at the 16th, made a double bogey and was tied for the lead at 14 under. However, Hadwin parred in for a level-par 71 and Patrick Cantlay bogeyed the last to finish second. Open champion Henrik Stenson was the top-placed European, finishing six shots back after a 70. Northern Ireland's Graeme McDowell had five birdies in a 67 and was nine shots adrift, while 41-year-old Ian Poulter, playing on a medical extension having missed four months of last season due to a foot injury, finished level for the tournament.

Media playback is not supported on this device Now, he has to find a replacement for the German as team-mate to Lewis Hamilton. And at this late stage of the year, it will be no easy task. So who will be on Wolff's shortlist and how likely are they to get the seat? This is the fight many would like to see. Hamilton and Alonso are regarded as the two towering talents of their generation and their intense battle as McLaren team-mates in 2007 was cut short by Alonso falling out with boss Ron Dennis and leaving the team. They ended that year tied on points, one behind world champion Kimi Raikkonen, with four wins each. Round two would be the biggest box office F1 could hope for, but it is highly unlikely to happen for two reasons: 1) Alonso is under contract to McLaren and even if he has a break clause - which they say he does not - they would not want to let him go; 2) More importantly, Wolff knows that the problems he had with Hamilton and Rosberg would pale compared to the potential difficulties of handling Hamilton and Alonso. Chances of it happening: 6/10 The Australian was the choice of many observers as the driver of 2016, and Wolff is a big fan. The on-track battle with Hamilton would be intense, but Ricciardo is a laid-back character and would probably be easier to handle off it. But he is under contract to Red Bull until 2018. Red Bull says they have no intention of letting him go, but if Wolff approached them there is just the possibility that they may consider selling Ricciardo. Why? Because most accept that, long term, Ricciardo and Max Verstappen is not a sustainable line-up - if Red Bull become title contenders their relationship is very likely to become incendiary. Chances: 6/10 Verstappen is the big rising star of F1. Shaded by Ricciardo over 2016 as a whole, performances such as his stunning drive in the wet in Brazil last month mark him out as a future world champion. Wolff would be very interested but, like Ricciardo, Verstappen is under contract to Red Bull - in his case to the end of 2019. And Red Bull are even more in love with the Dutchman than they are with Ricciardo. Chances: 4/10 Vettel's love affair with Ferrari - and vice versa - is long over after a difficult and disappointing season. Relations with team boss Maurizio Arrivabene are frayed - especially since the Italian said the four-time champion should focus more on his driving and needed to "earn" a new contract beyond 2017. And Vettel was unhappy with the decision to split with technical director James Allison in the summer. Likewise, Ferrari have been confused how, after a year and a half of easily beating team-mate Kimi Raikkonen, Vettel's form slipped in the second half of 2016 - although they might want to read the previous paragraph for an answer. Vettel has been shopping around for a move and would almost certainly welcome a switch to Mercedes. But there are some problems: 1) his contract runs to the end of 2017 and there is no obvious replacement for Ferrari; 2) he might not fancy going up against Hamilton; 3) Vettel and Hamilton together is almost as much of a recipe for trouble as Hamilton and Alonso. Chances of it happening: 8/10 Wolff has a long relationship with Bottas as part of his management team and rates him highly. The Finn has impressed in the last four seasons with Williams and would be a low-maintenance choice. He would deliver solid results on track and is calm and would not rock the boat off it. Next year is the last year of his contract at Williams. The team is not the most flush with cash in the pit lane and Wolff would almost certainly be able to put together an attractive deal - either for a cash payment to release Bottas or a reduction in Williams' engine fee. But Williams have an 18-year-old rookie in the well-resourced Canadian Lance Stroll in their other car next year and need experience in the lead car. Wolff could offer them Mercedes protege Pascal Wehrlein, who raced for Manor in 2016, in exchange. But would Williams accept? Felipe Nasr, who raced for Sauber in 2016, would also be an option for them, and please F1 boss Bernie Ecclestone, who needs a Brazilian in the sport to satisfy its largest single TV audience. Chances: 9/10 The German is the obvious choice - he is Mercedes' reserve driver, he has tested for the team several times, and he is a free agent. But he has only one season's race experience, and although he has put in some promising drives, he has had a few shaky ones as well. Putting him in a race-winning car with Hamilton as his team-mate would be a big ask. And that's without even considering his personality. Insiders say Wehrlein can be difficult and self-centred, and Wolff will be wary of putting such a character alongside Hamilton. Chances: 8/10 Another Mercedes young driver, Ocon has impressed in his half-season alongside Wehrlein at Manor - so much so that Force India picked him rather than the German as their second driver alongside Sergio Perez for 2017. But Ocon has only nine races under his belt and it's surely too early for him to get a seat at the factory Mercedes team. Chances: 7/10 A left-field choice, the Scot has been out of F1 for two years now. But he was Williams reserve driver this year and is a Mercedes-contracted driver in the DTM German Touring Car Championship and would be a solid option. Chances: 5/10 Button has retired from F1, but remains contracted to McLaren. He made it very clear in the last few weeks that he needed a break from the sport. Chances: 1/10 The German has just signed a three-year deal with Renault, but the French company and Mercedes have links on a corporate level and Wolff is close friends with their racing boss Frederic Vasseur. But taking Hulkenberg would leave Renault with a vacancy that would be tough to fill and Wolff is not overly enamoured with him either. Chances: 2/10	Mercedes Formula 1 boss Toto Wolff admits that Nico Rosberg's decision to retire took him completely by surprise - but it is only the start of his problems.
The two-time major winner last won at the Tournament of Champions in January 2016. Spieth carded a seven-under-par 65 in the third round to move to 17 under. Fellow American Brandt Snedeker (67) is second on 11 under, one ahead of Dustin Johnson and Kelly Kraft, who shot 66s. Spieth started the day in a share of the lead with world number one Jason Day and American Derek Fathauer on 10 under. Australian Day had a disastrous start with three bogeys and a double bogey in his opening six holes as he fell away with a three-over 75, while Fathauer signed for a 74. Spieth meanwhile was delighted with a return to form with the putter as he rolled in eight birdies, five on the back nine. "I hit my lines," the 23-year-old told Golf Channel. "It's been something I've been struggling with this year. "I've been striking the ball really well but my third and ninth place finishes were off of very average putting on strokes gained."	Jordan Spieth is on course to win his first PGA Tour title in over a year as he takes a six-shot lead into the final round of the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am.
Media playback is not supported on this device Ryan Giggs was the favourite following Bob Bradley's exit on Tuesday, but the club are now looking elsewhere. Wales boss Chris Coleman was also a target but is out of the running. Clement was interviewed for the job in October before Bradley replaced former head coach Francesco Guidolin. The former Derby County manager, who was sacked by the Rams in February, has spoken to the Swansea hierarchy having impressed them in the autumn. Rowett, meanwhile, has not taken on a job since his sacking by Birmingham City earlier in December. The Swans are hopeful of having Bradley's replacement in place before the trip to Crystal Palace on 3 January. Alan Curtis, who is taking temporary charge of the team, believes the club's next manager should be British and have experience of the Premier League. "It has to be the right man. Ideally they would be British and know the Premier League," Curtis said. "[The owners] have to be satisfied he fills all the criteria for getting us out of the trouble we find ourselves in." Former Swansea forward Curtis, who is preparing for Saturday's home game with Bournemouth, says he has spoken to chairman Huw Jenkins but does not know how long he will be in charge. "We will take it on a day by day basis," he continued. "What the club needs is not a change of direction. The club has been the club and the way we run the club is the way that suits us. "Somebody needs to come in with our philosophy with a little bit of experience and perhaps look at it with fresh eyes. That's exactly what it needs."	Bayern Munich assistant manager Paul Clement is the leading candidate to become Swansea City's new manager - but former Birmingham City boss Gary Rowett remains in contention.
A report to its executive committee seeks approval to get the process under way during this school year. The local authority is carrying out the review against a background of "ongoing financial challenges". However, it stressed that it was not simply about making savings but also delivering benefits. But what are some of the key issues to be addressed? Councillors are being recommended to start statutory consultation on the closure of three schools in the region. Eccles/Leitholm Primary, Ettrick Primary and Hobkirk Primary have already been mothballed. A full report on their position is likely to be delivered later this year. The viability and provision of the existing four Roman Catholic schools in the Borders has been a "considerable challenge for the council over a number of years". In 2012, one head teacher was put in place for all of  them. Now the authority hopes to carry out further informal consultation on the best way forward. It would consider school leadership structures, the continuation of provision in four locations, staff recruitment and the quality of education. The council is proposing to engage with all its rural schools with less than 50 pupils over the sustainability of those numbers. Staff will attend parent council meetings at the schools involved. Discussion on the future of education provision in the towns of Jedburgh, Eyemouth, Hawick and Galashiels is also planned. Phase one of the review would also see a Selkirk schools catchment review involving Yarrow, Kirkhope, Philiphaugh and Knowepark Primaries. The second phase, to start in the following school year, would look at the Berwickshire, Earlston, Kelso and Peebles school clusters. A review of school transport policy has also been promised before the end of 2017/18. Councillor Sandy Aitchison said: "The principle of the school estate review is to look at our buildings and locations with a view to increasing educational opportunities, improving outcomes for children and young people and ensuring that our school estate is sustainable, affordable and suitable for the future. "The pre-consultation with parents, pupils and communities has given us a 'warts and all' assessment of our schools from these key stakeholders. "Going forward, these views will be taken into account in the next stage of our discussions and in the formal proposals we will take out to public consultation. "The school estate review as a whole, and the actions identified following the specific consultations to take place, are not going to be an overnight process and we are committed to fully engaging with parents, pupils, staff and wider community as we progress with the review over the coming months and years."	Scottish Borders Council is set to start the first phase of a wide-ranging overhaul of its schools provision across the region.
Jason James, 41, of Charles Road, Torquay, previously admitted manslaughter at Winchester Crown Court. Dave "Chewie" Coxon, from Torquay died after being struck once by his friend as they headed home after a night of heavy drinking. They had both attended the 40th anniversary rally of the Modrapheniacs Scooter Club near Wareham in Dorset. The pair, who were both members of the Cyder Commando Scooter Club, were heading back to their caravan on 5 March and stopped off to relieve themselves. Mr James told police his friend had urinated on his leg and said: "I punched him and knocked him out", describing the blow as a "little whack". He did not wait to see what state Mr Coxon, who never regained consciousness, was in, the court heard. Judge Keith Cutler said: "What clearly should have been a weekend of fun and enjoyment turned into this tragedy." Mr Coxon's brother Jonathan said after the case: "We can see very few circumstances where there would be sufficient provocation to justify this kind of cowardly attack."	A man has been jailed for four years for killing a fellow scooter enthusiast who urinated on his leg at a rally.
Filled with jazz solos and politically-charged lyrics, it appers to be a companion piece to Butterfly, rather than a standalone record. All of the tracks are untitled, save for the date they were recorded. Strangely, its appearance seems to have been prompted by basketball star LeBron James. The sportsman tweeted Lamar's record label boss Anthony Tiffith following the rapper's incendiary Grammy Award performance - in which he debuted a verse that alluded to the 2012 death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin - demanding "you have to release those untitled tracks ASAP!" Tiffith replied he would think about it and, earlier this week, hinted at the release in an Instagram post: "I've decided to drop a project one day this week. I won't say what day or who." He later posted that fans should thank James for the new release. Untitled Unmastered appeared at around 04:00 GMT on all major streaming services including Spotify, Apple Music and Google Play. It features a cameo from singer Cee Lo Green, while Alicia Keys' five-year-old son Egypt allegedly produced the sprawling, eight-minute Untitled 07, which ends with a lo-fi recording of Lamar improvising lyrics to amuse his friends. The musician recently told hip-hop site 2 Dope Boyz he was sitting on a vault of material which didn't make the cut for To Pimp A Butterfly. "I got a chamber of material from the album that I was in love with where sample clearances or something as simple as a deadline kept it off the album. But I think probably close to 10 songs that I'm in love with that I'll still play and still perform that didn't make the cut." Fans will already be familiar with some of the songs, which Lamar has performed on US TV. Among them is Untitled 03, originally unveiled on late-night chat show The Colbert Report, which deals with religion, success and the exploitation of his music. Curiously, the studio version fades out before the song's original, angry coda, written as a response to the Black Lives Matter movement: "What the Black man say? Tell em, we don't die / We multiply." But the album doesn't shy away from political commentary, with Lamar chanting: "The government mislead the youth / And welfare don't mean well for you." The Compton-born performer was the most-nominated artist going into this year's Grammys, shortlisted in 11 categories. He took home five prizes on the night - including best rap album - but lost out on the main prize, album of the year, to Taylor Swift's 1989. To Pimp A Butterfly also had some high profile fans, including US President Barack Obama who named the song How Much A Dollar Cost, a parable with parallels to the Biblical story of the Good Samaritan, as his favourite song of 2015. Lamar is due to headline the BST festival in London's Hyde Park this summer.	Rapper Kendrick Lamar has released a surprise eight-track album, Untitled Unmastered, comprising outtakes from the Grammy-winning To Pimp A Butterfly.
Richard Broughton, 37, died on Sunday after he was knocked down by a car in Elsecar at around 19:00 GMT on Friday. The car did not stop at the scene. South Yorkshire Police has since recovered a vehicle in connection with the crash. A 23-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder, and a 35-year-old man has been held on suspicion of violent disorder. Both men remain in custody. Police said a disturbance was reported prior to the incident on Welland Crescent. Officers have appealed for anyone with information to come forward.	Two men have been arrested following an alleged hit-and-run in Barnsley.
Lasse Vibe netted a first-half double for the Bees which followed a Nico Yennaris close-range finish to make the result all but secure by half-time. Zach Clough scored a second-half consolation from the penalty spot for the Trotters after Alan McCormack was penalised for a foul. Bolton are 17 points from safety with six games remaining in the season. Defeat for Bolton extended their dreadful sequence of no away wins in a year and means defeat at Derby at the weekend will spell relegation for Wanderers. A second win in as many games for Brentford lifted them 12 points clear of the bottom three. Alan Judge was the creator of the home side's first chance when he almost looped a cross from the right over Ben Amos, but struck the bar. The midfielder provided a pinpoint cross from Vibe's second goal with a header, which was the Denmark striker's third goal in two games. Brentford manager Dean Smith: Media playback is not supported on this device "If you'd said to me three weeks ago that we'd have two wins on the spin at Nottingham Forest and again here, I'd have bitten your hand off. "It means we can go to Ipswich on Saturday and try to make it three wins in a row and then we can be looking at a top 10 finish. "I wanted more goals but with the run of form we've been on I wanted a result and that was the most important thing." Bolton caretaker manager Jimmy Phillips: Media playback is not supported on this device "We have to give the supporters something to cheer about rather than give them the kind of displays we gave in the first half tonight. "In the second half we were more competitive and we always say we have to compete before we can play. "Before the break we were nowhere near as competitive as we needed to be."	Bolton could be relegated to League One on Saturday after they were beaten by Brentford at Griffin Park.
That's according to a new report by a senior group of MPs. Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee said recruiters should try websites like Mumsnet to help increase the proportion of female spies. It wants more of them working in places like MI5, MI6 and communications spy centre GCHQ. The report says women in the intelligence services are being held back by a layer of male, middle managers labelled "the permafrost" who have a "very traditional male mentality and outlook". Mumsnet chief executive Justine Roberts responded to the call for recruiters to use things like her website but we're thinking she wasn't being entirely serious. "I'm afraid I'm unable to comment as I have an urgent appointment with a rock in St. James's Park." While the report showed 37% of staff at MI5, MI6 and GCHQ are women, it also pointed out they make up less than one in five senior staff. However, things have been changing in recent years. Stella Rimington became the first female boss of MI5 in 1992. That was three years before actress Judi Dench took over as James Bond's boss, M, in the British film franchise. In response to the report the government said: "We are committed to ensuring the most talented people succeed and reach top positions, regardless of gender, ethnicity, sexuality or disability."

Apple Music performed a U-turn over payment policy a day after the pop star threatened to prevent the US firm from streaming her album 1989. Swift had argued that Apple withholding payments during a three-month trial period was not fair for artists. But photographer Jason Sheldon said the singer herself did not "play fair" when it came to image rights. Some of the claims he has made in an open letter to Swift have been disputed by representatives of the 25-year-old singer. In it he wrote: "If you don't like being exploited, that's great - make a huge statement about it, and you'll have my support. But how about making sure you're not guilty of the very same tactic before you have a pop at someone else? "With all due respect to you too Taylor, you can do the right thing and change your photo policy. Photographers don't ask for your music for free. Please don't ask us to provide you with your marketing material for free." Mr Sheldon, who runs the Walsall-based Junction 10 agency, said he and other photographers had been called to hand over some rights to their images from Swift's live concerts. To cover a performance in March 2011 at Birmingham's LG Arena, Mr Sheldon said he had to sign a permission form that granted Swift's management company long-term rights to reuse the images and prevented him from featuring them after the initial coverage. "I can't use it in my portfolio, feature it on my website and even the original newspaper couldn't reuse it," Mr Sheldon said. "What's more, they can give my image to my clients for press purposes. It's giving my work away for free." He said the photo authorisation form included a section that gave the management firm "perpetual worldwide right to use (and to authorise others to use) any or all of the photographs for any non-commercial purpose". Mr Sheldon said clauses such as this were becoming more common in photo agreement forms. He said it was Swift's stance with Apple that "jarred" - with her "lambasting" the firm over using music for free, when her management firm was "guilty of doing the same thing with photos". In a statement, a spokesperson for Swift said: "The standard photography agreement has been misrepresented in that it clearly states that any photographer shooting The 1989 World Tour has the opportunity for further use of said photographs with management's approval. "Another distinct misrepresentation is the claim that the copyright of the photographs will be with anyone other than the photographer - this agreement does not transfer copyright away from the photographer. "Every artist has the right to, and should, protect the use of their name and likeness." Mr Sheldon said he had seen a 2015 version of the same contract that was even more strict, although he had not applied for one. "I fully agree with Taylor Swift's stance against Apple, but it's about her playing by the same rules she wants to live by," he said.	A photographer has accused Taylor Swift of "double standards" in her row with Apple over music streaming.
The judges said Neurotribes: The Legacy of Autism and How to Think Smarter About People Who Think Differently was a "tour de force" of journalistic and scientific research. It is the first popular science book to win the prize in its 17-year history. The shortlist had included Jonathan Bate's Ted Hughes: The Unauthorised Life and Robert Macfarlane's Landmarks. Historian Anne Applebaum, chair of the judges, praised Silberman's "compassionate journalism" and said he excelled at using stories and anecdotes to explain complex medical issues to a wide audience. The American author, who is based in San Francisco, has been a science writer for Wired and other magazines such as the New Yorker, the MIT Technology Review, Nature and Salon for more than 20 years. "We admired Silberman's work because it is powered by a strongly argued set of beliefs: that we should stop drawing sharp lines between what we assume to be 'normal' and 'abnormal', and that we should remember how much the differently-wired human brain has, can and will contribute to our world," Applebaum said. "He has injected a hopeful note into a conversation that's normally dominated by despair." Neurotribes, she added, was "a tour de force of archival, journalistic and scientific research, both deeply researched and widely accessible". In its review of Silberman's book, The Guardian described Neurotribes as "a gripping narrative written with journalistic verve". The £20,000 Samuel Johnson Prize was won last year by Helen Macdonald's H is for Hawk.	Author Steve Silberman has won the £20,000 Samuel Johnson Prize for Non-Fiction for his book about autism.

Caerleon-born Machen, who died in 1947, is known for his story The Bowmen, set in World War One, which gave rise to the legend of the Angels of Mons. Newport council is consulting on budget plans that could see the library shut. A spokesman said it would relocate the reference library if the building shut but no decisions have been made. The Friends of Arthur Machen literary society said its members, who include comedian Stewart Lee, actor Barry Humphries and writer Alan Moore, are writing to the local authority. Friends' founding member Godrey Brangham said: "This obviously is of great concern regarding the Machen collection in the reference library." Friends' chairman Ray Russell said: "Newport holds the finest public Machen collection in the UK. "We'd like them to preserve it, develop it, and keep access to it open. "Arthur Machen was a local son of Gwent who won worldwide literary fame, and it is hoped that Newport will continue to honour his work." Arthur Machen 1863-1947 •Born 150 years ago in Caerleon, south Wales •Fantasy and horror writer •Works include early self-published book Eleusina, The Great God Pan and The Three Imposters •Fans include Stephen King, Mick Jagger and Rowan Williams •His portrait is in the National Museum Wales More about the first modern horror writer The leader of the council has met with the group, and a spokesman said: "If the proposal to close the central library building did go ahead then the council would consider where the best possible place to relocate the reference library would be." The consultation on the council's budget savings proposals continues until 16 January 2015.	Fans of horror writer Arthur Machen have called on Newport council to protect the collection of his books and papers at the city's central library.
A team from Glasgow University found there was a sharp fall in accidents from 5,901 in 1997 to 2,914 in 2014. The researchers said, however, there was "no evidence" the M74 had impacted on an "already decreasing trend". The five-mile (8km) route, which cost Â£692m, links the M74 at Carmyle to the M8 southwest of the Kingston Bridge. Planning permission for the route was granted in October 1995 and immediately opposed by Joint Action Against the M74 (Jam74) - a coalition of community, environmental and sustainable transport groups. Construction began in 2008 after a last-ditch legal bid to halt the project was abandoned by Friends of the Earth Scotland and Jam74. Supporters claimed the road would bring economic benefits to the west of Scotland and help cut accidents, whereas critics argued it would cause more pollution, increase health problems and fragment communities. The Glasgow University study looked to evaluate the impact of the M74 extension on the number of road accidents on local roads during the construction period and following its opening. Lead author of the report, Dr Jonathan Olsen, said: "The building of the M74 extension in the south of Glasgow was controversial. There were strong arguments for and against its construction, but ultimately it went ahead. "One of the arguments in favour was that it could reduce road accidents on local streets. "In our study we examined police accident data from 1997 to 2014, three years after the new motorway was opened, and found that this predicted reduction in road accident numbers had not materialised." He added: "But on the other hand, we found no evidence that the M74 extension had led to an increase in accidents." Report co-author, Professor Rich Mitchell, added: "There is surprisingly little evidence about the impacts new motorways have. "This research will be useful for planners, politicians and residents elsewhere who are trying to decide whether to build or not." The study is published in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health.	The controversial M74 extension through Glasgow has had little impact on road traffic accidents in the city since it opened in 2011, a new study has found.
The breach happened 10 days ago when the council's website service provider, which is based in England, was targeted by hackers. The City of Edinburgh Council assured those affected no other personal details were accessed. Officials have warned of a potential increase in spam or phishing emails. They said the incident had been reported to both the Information Commissioner and the UK Government's Computer Emergency Response Team and that extra security measures had been put in place. A council spokeswoman said: "This was a malicious cyber attack on the council's website which is hosted in a UK data centre. It was dealt with swiftly and at no point were any council services affected. "We are contacting everyone who has been affected to inform them of the incident and offer them advice and support. We have reassured individuals that the only details that have been accessed are their email addresses. "The Information Commissioner's Office has been informed and preventative measures have been taken by the web service providers. "We want to reassure the public the ongoing security of our website is critically important, and we continue to work with our service providers to ensure that the risks associated with attacks are dealt with."	More than 13,000 email addresses have been stolen from Edinburgh city council's database following a "malicious cyber attack".
Police were called to Nuthurst Park in Moston, Manchester, just before 18:55 BST on Saturday. Greater Manchester Police said officers responded to reports of a girl being raped and the suspect being chased off by members of the public. A boy was arrested in a nearby shop. The 16-year-old was remanded to appear at Manchester Youth Court on Monday. The girl is being supported by specially-trained officers. GMP added: "We are aware of a lot of local speculation regarding the investigation and we would ask that this please stops to allow the investigation and legal process to continue without prejudice."	A 16-year-old boy has been charged with the rape of an eight-year-old girl in a park.
The contractor, Smartty's Management Limited, has been asked to return the excess payment, the government said. On Wednesday, Transport Minister Dzifa Attivor resigned following a public outcry over the deal. Ghana is struggling with a large budget deficit and a widening public debt. The branding involved respraying the 116 imported passenger buses and adding portraits of the current President John Mahama, his three immediate predecessors and Ghana's first head of state, Kwame Nkrumah. A proper procurement method was "not followed and the contract did not ensure value for money," the government said after a review by Attorney General Marietta Brew Appiah-Opong. Opposition and anti-corruption campaigners have raised concerns over the amount spent, which they said was far too much, forcing the presidency to set up an investigation. The BBC's Sammy Darko in the capital, Accra, says many people think the government is not doing enough to tackle budget mismanagement. They want to see people being charged for causing financial loss to the state, he adds. Mrs Attivor's resignation is the first by a Ghanaian minister in more than a decade and comes amid efforts by the government to cut spending as it implements a three-year International Monetary Fund plan to restore fiscal stability. Earlier this week, Mr Mahama banned public officials, including ministers, from first class air travel and he suspended non-essential trips.	Ghana has demanded a $500,000 (£350,000) refund after its transport ministry spent $1m to paint more than 100 buses with portraits of the country's recent leaders.
Plans for the Ysgol y Berwyn site were originally approved in 2015, and the campus was due to open in 2018. But a petition called for a review of proposals that would see the Church own the buildings. On Tuesday, Gwynedd's cabinet agreed to consult on the school's Church status. The Diocese of St Asaph said it was "disappointed but not surprised" by the decision, and accused the council of making "a complete mess of this project". "The fundamental issue here is that Cyngor Gwynedd (council) has withdrawn its support for this project and as a result has intentionally destabilised the partnership," said the Church in a statement. The original plans would have seen the merging of Ysgol Bro Tegid and Ysgol Beuno Sant, a Church in Wales school, with the secondary Ysgol y Berwyn. But following calls for the site to be designated a community campus - rather than a Church school - the council cabinet has agreed to a new formal consultation. "Unfortunately, following a long period of working in partnership with the Church in Wales, the latest developments have caused great concern amongst governors and members of the local community and poses a significant risk to the success of the school," said the cabinet's education member, Gareth Thomas. "As a result, the cabinet has decided to support the recommendation to hold a formal consultation with governors on the option to abandon the existing proposal." In its statement, the Church said it felt the council "now has a responsibility to the community, children and the diocese to find a way forward that develops community and church education". Church officials said they hoped the council would contact them over the developments "as a matter of urgency".	Gwynedd's council leadership has come under fire from the Church in Wales in a row over the future of plans for a new £10m school campus serving the Bala area.
A number of homes were inundated in Gorleston and nearby Bradwell on Sunday. The flooding followed a 90-minute downpour. Jonathan Wilby, of Great Yarmouth fire station, said: "Drains and pumping systems were unable to cope with the amount of rain." He added: "We prevented some homes from being flooded by pumping water away."	Torrential rain caused flash flooding of homes and businesses in coastal areas of east Norfolk.
Alex D'Acol headed the hosts ahead early on from Ali Crawford's corner. Inverness had the chance to level after Darian MacKinnon fouled Billy Mckay in the box but Greg Tansey's penalty was saved by Gary Woods. Grant Gillespie converted Rakish Bingham's pass to double Accies' lead and Bingham added a goal of his own. Media playback is not supported on this device The visitors had been boosted by former striker Mckay's loan signing from Wigan being completed shortly before kick-off to allow him to play, but it was Accies who dominated as they welcomed back the experienced Mikey Devlin and Massimo Donati after injury. Both sides had been struggling to find a win, and the lack of confidence was evident for most of the first half, although Mckay blasted a volley into the side netting to give the small band of away fans some early hope. Before the match Hamilton boss Martin Canning had said the first goal would be hugely influential and it was his side who grabbed it with a well rehearsed move from Crawford's corner. D'Acol got away from his marker on the near post and his glancing header found the net past Owain Fon Williams for his seventh goal of the season. Caley Thistle then blew a major opportunity to equalise after referee Euan Anderson had pointed to the spot on 26 minutes. Woods guessed right, diving right to produce a superb save to deny Tansey. Accies then lost Crawford to injury just after the half-hour, with new signing Blair Adams taking his place and Gillespie taking on Crawford's midfield responsibilities. That move paid off after the interval when Bingham drove down the left, crossed low into the box and Gillespie timed his run superbly to send a side-foot shot past Fon Williams. Bingham then produced the best moment of the night, smashing a terrific 18-yard effort high past the Welsh goalkeeper for his fourth goal of the campaign, the Caley Thistle defence ripped apart and their fans starting to dread the long, late trip home. It was a first league win in 12 for Hamilton and only their third in the division this season. Meanwhile, Richie Foran has a major task ahead to convince his men that they can stay in a top flight becoming tougher and tougher as Inverness' winless league run stretched to the dozen mark. Media playback is not supported on this device Hamilton player-manager Martin Canning: "The performance was similar to Saturday, but there were key moments there with the penalty save and the second goal, because we have not been taking the opportunity to get the second goal when we have had the chance so far this season. "If we continue to make the big moments go in our favour and capitalise on them, then we can move up the table and continue to win games. "We haven't punished teams, but tonight we did and we make it comfortable for ourselves and that should have probably happened four or five times this season. "The league is so tight, we have gone from joint bottom to four points off the top six and it gives us a great incentive to go on and try to do something against Kilmarnock on Saturday." Inverness manager Richie Foran: "That puts us into a relegation battle now - forget about top six, we are in a relegation battle now. "Some of our players have not got the bottle, they showed that today. We might have been the better side in the first half and their keeper pulled off a great save from the penalty, but some of our boys are hiding and we are in for a fight now. "I told them straight, 'I can see who is bottling it, I can see who does not want to take the ball'. It is not them all - I thought Billy Mckay was excellent - but it makes it a massive game for us now on Saturday against Dundee. "That was our worst defeat of the season. I'll take my share of the blame, but the players now need to stand up and be counted." Match ends, Hamilton Academical 3, Inverness CT 0. Second Half ends, Hamilton Academical 3, Inverness CT 0.

Omar Al Shaikh and Amie Cresswell, both 16, tied the knot in front of family, friends and patients on a ward at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham. Omar, from Brierley Hill in the West Midlands, died on Monday after a suitable stem cell donor could not be found in time. He had proposed to Amie after learning he only had days left to live. Omar's aunt Anca Dumitriu said: "It was beautiful and he was happy... after he put the ring on Amie's finger he held her and was like 'you're mine now'. He was proper happy." What is it? Why does it happen? A number of factors which can increase the risk of developing AML have been identified. These include: Source: NHS Choices Former Air Cadet Omar, who wore his dressing gown during the Islamic ceremony, was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia after fainting during a football match. His mixed Arabic and Romanian heritage made it difficult to find a stem cell donor and by the time one was eventually found, he was too ill to have the transplant. Medical staff broke news the cancer had gone into his bone marrow earlier this month. His mother said he was strong right until the end. "He died in peace," she said. Friends and relatives are urging people to sign the Anthony Nolan register. The charity recruits stem cell donors and carries out research to make bone marrow transplants more effective.	A terminally ill teenager married his school sweetheart three days before dying from leukaemia.
He has named several players with problems in his preliminary 24-man squad, including Charles Kaboré, Préjuce Nakoulma, Jonathan Pitroipa and Bertrand Traoré. "I am confident they can recover in time," Duarte insisted. The squad is due to begin a training camp on 27 December. Bakary Koné is another player from the 2013 squad that finished as runners-up in South Africa who has an injury concern. Injury has ruled out Aziz Kabore, who plays for Valenciennes in France, while there is a first call-up for Blati Toure. The 22-year-old was born in Ivory Coast, played as a junior in Spain but is now at Omonia Nicosia of Cyprus. "Blati Touré is a player I adore. I've watched him since he was at Evian TG I France but I was told he was Ivorian, but he called me to assure me he is 100 percent Burkinabe," Duarte explained. "He hasn't yet trained with us but he is player with the quality to make a positive addition." Also included are the uncapped Morocco-based Ernest Aboubacar Congo, called up last month for the first time for last month's World Cup qualifier against the Cape Verde Islands, and Issoumaila Lingane of Hapoel Ashkelon in Israel. Besides Aziz Kabore, the most significant absence is first choice goalkeeper Daouda Diakite, who was seriously injured three months ago playing for AS Vita Club in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The Stallions will leave Ouagadougou on 27 December to train in Marrakech where they play a Morocco B team on 4 January and Mali a few days later. Burkina Faso meet Cameroon in Libreville in their first Group A game on the opening day of the Nations Cup finals on 14 January. Squad: Goalkeepers: Germain Sanou (Beauvais, France), Hervé Koffi (ASEC Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire), Aboubacar Sawadogo (RC Kadiogo) Defenders: Ernest Aboubacar Congo (IZK Khemisset, Morocco), Yacouba Coulibaly (RC Kadiogo), Youssoufou Dayo (RCB Berkane, Morocco), Bakary Koné (Malaga, Spain), Patrick Malo (Smouha, Egypt), Issouf Paro (Santos, South Africa), Steeve Yago (Toulouse, France) Midfielders: Cyrille Bayala (Sheriff Tiraspol, Moldova), Adama Guira (Racing Lens, France), Charles Kaboré (FC Krasnodar, Russia), Prejuce Nakoulma (Kayserispor, Turkey), Jonathan Pitroipa (Al Nasr, United Arab Emirates), Bakary Sare (Moreirense, Portugal), Blati Toure (Omonia Nicosia, Cyprus), Abdou Razack Traore (Karabukspor, Turkey), Alain Traore (Kayserispor, Turkey), Jonathan Zongo (Almeria, Spain) Forwards: Aristide Bance (Asec Mimosas, Ivory Coast), Banou Diawara (Smouha, Egypt), Issoumaila Lingane (Hapoel Ashkelon, Israel), Bertrand Traore (Ajax Amsterdam, Netherlands).	Burkina Faso coach Paulo Duarte says he has is not concerned over a number of injuries to key players going into next month's African Nations Cup finals.
The Ministry of Peshmerga Affairs said blood samples from about 35 fighters revealed traces of sulphur mustard. It did not say if any of the peshmerga had died as a result of the attack, or how severely they had been wounded. Mustard gas can burn skin and cause severe respiratory problems, and is banned under international law. The exposure took place along the front lines near the northern Iraqi towns of Makhmour and Gwer, the ministry said in a statement. Roughly 37 mortars were fired in the attack, the statement added, "releasing white smoke and a black liquid". The ministry called on countries fighting IS to give peshmerga fighters equipment for protection against chemical attacks. Several countries including the United States are already giving military assistance to the Kurdish fighters. This is not the first time IS has been accused of using chemical weapons. In March, Kurdish authorities in Iraq said they had evidence that IS had used chlorine gas. That allegation, by the Kurdistan Region Security Council, followed similar claims that the group had used low-grade chemical weapons against Iraqi security forces. The director of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons expressed "serious concern" in August over the possibility IS was using prohibited chemical weapons. The UN recently adopted a resolution aimed at identifying those behind chemical weapons attacks in Syria. IS already has a large arsenal of conventional weapons and military vehicles seized from the Iraqi army, much of it produced by the United States. Iraq Kurds were the victim of a major chemical weapons attack by the Iraqi military under Saddam Hussein in 1988, which left thousands dead in the city of Halabja.	Islamic State (IS) militants fired mortar rounds containing mustard agent at Kurdish peshmerga fighters in northern Iraq, Kurdish officials say.
Paulo Roberto Costa - who is in jail and being investigated for involvement in the alleged scheme - named a minister, governors and congressmen. Among them were members of the governing Workers Party and groups which back President Dilma Rousseff. But the names, published in a magazine, also included rivals of Ms Rousseff. Many of the names were published in Veja, one of Brazil's leading magazines, just weeks before the presidential election in which Ms Rousseff is running for a second term in office. Several politicians mentioned have denied involvement. Mr Costa claimed that politicians received 3% commissions on the values of contracts signed with Petrobras when he was working there from 2004 to 2012. He alleged that the scheme was used to buy support for the government in congressional votes. Mr Costa was arrested in 2013. He is now in jail and struck a plea-bargain deal with prosecutors before giving the names. Ahead of the election, Ms Rousseff's approval ratings have been slipping in opinion polls in favour of her rival, former Environment Minister Marina Silva. The BBC's Wyre Davies in Rio de Janeiro says the latest allegations could hurt the incumbent further, as during her presidency Petrobras has dramatically underperformed and its costs have risen sharply. It has become one of the world's most indebted oil companies and lost half of its market value in three years. The BBC has requested a comment from Petrobras about the latest allegations and is awaiting a response.	An ex-director of Brazil's state-run oil company Petrobras is reported to have accused more than 40 politicians of involvement in a kickback scheme.
Lord Carey writes in the Daily Mail that he has dropped his opposition to the Assisted Dying Bill "in the face of the reality of needless suffering". But the current Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby has called the bill "mistaken and dangerous". Peers will debate the bill on Friday. Tabled by Labour peer Lord Falconer, the legislation would make it legal for adults in England and Wales to be given assistance ending their own life. It would apply to those with less than six months to live. Two doctors would have to independently confirm the patient was terminally ill and had reached their own, informed decision to die. Some 110 peers are already listed to speak when the House of Lords debates the private members bill on Friday. Insisting it would not be "anti-Christian" to change the law, Lord Carey said the current situation risked "undermining the principle of human concern which should lie at the heart of our society". He added: "Today we face a central paradox. In strictly observing the sanctity of life, the Church could now actually be promoting anguish and pain, the very opposite of a Christian message of hope." When Lord Carey was still the Archbishop of Canterbury he was among the opponents of Lord Joffe's Assisting Dying for the Terminally Ill Bill, which was successfully blocked in the House of Lords in 2006. But in his article in Saturday's Daily Mail Lord Carey said: "The fact is that I have changed my mind. The old philosophical certainties have collapsed in the face of the reality of needless suffering." He said it was the case of Tony Nicklinson, who had locked-in syndrome and died after being refused the legal right to die , who had had the "deepest influence" on his decision. Mr Nicklinson's widow Jane, said Lord Carey's switch was "huge". "I'm amazed actually and thrilled because the Church has always been one of our greatest opponents," she told BBC Radio 5 live. "Someone shouldn't be forced to stay alive with daily suffering - his life was a living hell." There's been something of a shocked reaction to what Lord Carey said. Let's remember he's a former archbishop. He still has some influence in the Church, especially among the more traditionalist minded Anglicans. So what he said really will have some consequences. He'll also have some influence presumably in the House of Lords, having argued in the past strongly against similar legislation. One of the most telling things about what Lord Carey has said is that he now thinks it's not "un-Christian" to allow people to take their own lives when they're suffering at the end of their lives. It speaks to a body of people, including in the Anglican church, who now feel they can to some extent re-interpret what it is to be Christian, to be Anglican and how to put that into practice in their everyday lives. To hear that coming from a stalwart defender of biblical truth like Lord Carey is pretty significant. Lord Falconer told BBC Radio 5 live that Lord Carey "makes the point that it's not anti-Christian to support the change in the law that my bill proposes". "I believe it reflects the view of almost everyone in the debate that - whatever view you take about the issues - nobody wants people who are properly motivated by compassion to be prosecuted. And he puts those arguments incredibly powerfully." However, the current Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby warned Lord Falconer's bill would mean elderly and disabled people coming under pressure to end their lives. "What sort of society would we be creating if we were to allow this sword of Damocles to hang over the head of every vulnerable, terminally-ill person in the country?" he wrote in the Times. "It would be very naive to think that many of the elderly people who are abused and neglected each year, as well as many severely disabled individuals, would not be put under pressure to end their lives if assisted suicide were permitted by law. "It would be equally naive to believe, as the Assisted Dying Bill suggests, that such pressure could be recognised in every instance by doctors given the task of assessing requests for assisted suicide. "Abuse, coercion and intimidation can be slow instruments in the hands of the unscrupulous, creating pressure on vulnerable people who are encouraged to 'do the decent thing'." The 1961 Suicide Act makes it an offence to encourage or assist a suicide or a suicide attempt in England and Wales. Anyone doing so could face up to 14 years in prison. The law is almost identical in Northern Ireland. There is no specific law on assisted suicide in Scotland, creating some uncertainty, although in theory someone could be prosecuted under homicide legislation. There have already been several attempts to legalise assisted dying, but these have been rejected. The Commission on Assisted Dying, established and funded by campaigners who have been calling for a change in the law, concluded in 2012 that there was a "strong case" for allowing assisted suicide for people who are terminally ill in England and Wales. But the medical profession and disability rights groups, among others, argue that the law should not be changed because it is there to protect the vulnerable in society. In other countries, such as Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, legislation has been introduced to allow assisted dying. France is considering a possible introduction of similar legislation, although there is opposition from its medical ethics council. Campaign group Dignity in Dying predicts that a lot more countries will follow suit. The Bishop of Carlisle, the Right Reverend James Newcome, said Lord Carey's comments would not influence any vote by bishops in the House of Lords. "The general synod has debated it and come to a conclusion. That's the position to which we're sticking." But Lord Carey did received support from Rabbi Jonathan Romain, an inter-faith leader for campaign group Dignity in Dying. He said the experience in the US state of Oregon - where assisted dying became legal in 1997 - showed "very few people" would use the right to get help to end their lives. The Church of England said in a statement that its governing body, the General Synod, had passed a motion on the issue in February 2012. The motion reaffirmed the Church's "support for the current law on assisted suicide as a means of contributing to a just and compassionate society in which vulnerable people are protected". And Reverend Rose Hudson-Wilkin, who is the Speaker's chaplain in the House of Commons, said having an assisted suicide law would sanitise death. "I just happen to believe that matters of life and death in that way is not for us to play with. There are lots and lots of vulnerable people out there... you cannot make a law that is going to have a serious impact on a majority of people." Dr Peter Saunders, chief executive of the Christian Medical Fellowship said he was concerned about vulnerable people being exploited. "We've got to think about the people who are going to feel a duty to end their lives so as not to be a burden to others. "I'm worried about the disabled people, the depressed and elderly, who are going to be put at danger by this bill which really just has eligibility criteria and not safeguards."	Former Archbishop of Canterbury Lord Carey says he will support legislation that would make it legal for terminally ill people in England and Wales to receive help to end their lives.
Ai has accused Lego of "censorship and discrimination" after it refused his bulk order for bricks for a new exhibition in Melbourne, Australia. Lego said it has never sold directly to anyone wanting to use its product to make a political statement. The artist will now use the donated toy bricks to make a "new work". "In response to Lego's refusal and the overwhelming public response, Ai Weiwei has now decided to make a new work to defend freedom of speech and 'political art'," said a post on the artist's Instagram account on Monday. "Ai Weiwei Studio will announce the project description and Lego collection points in different cities. This is the first phase of the coming projects." Further posts pictured a red car labelled, "the first Lego container", and a photo of Lego bricks inside the car, accompanied by the words, "the morning droppings". Ai used Lego last year to create portraits of 175 dissident figures who had been jailed or exiled, from Nelson Mandela to Edward Snowden, on the site of the former Alcatraz prison near San Francisco. He planned a similar work for the National Gallery of Victoria in Melbourne, but a bulk order placed by the museum was rejected by the Danish company. The Chinese artist said the company told the museum its bricks could not be used for artworks containing "any political, religious, racist, obscene or defaming statements". Referring to The Lego Movie's slogan "everything is awesome", Ai wrote on Twitter: "Lego will tell us what to do, or not to do. That is awesome!" He added: "Lego is giving us the definition of what is 'political', and all the big corporations are telling us what to love or hate. That is awesome." In an earlier Instagram post, he wrote: "As a commercial entity, Lego produces and sells toys, movies and amusement parks attracting children across the globe. "As a powerful corporation, Lego is an influential cultural and political actor in the globalized economy with questionable values. "Lego's refusal to sell its product to the artist is an act of censorship and discrimination." Lego spokesman Roar Rude Trangbaek would not comment directly on the case but said that, as a principle, Lego "respects any individual's right to free, creative expression". The artist also linked Lego's stance with plans for a new Legoland in Shanghai. Lego said the theme park was being built by Merlin Entertainment and not Lego, but that Lego does have some ties with Merlin because it uses the Lego brand. Ai Weiwei is known for his criticism of the Chinese government as well as for being one of the world's leading contemporary artists. Many fans have utilised Lego to help show their support for the artist on social media. One used the toy bricks to spell out the words "I support Ai Weiwei", while others offered to let the artist borrow their collection, adding, "we won't be buying more".	Artist Ai Weiwei is setting up "Lego collection points" in different cities after being inundated with offers of donations from supporters.
An area of the town near the swimming pool had been evacuated for most of the morning and early afternoon. Other residents close by had been advised to open windows, stay indoors near walls and to avoid going outside. An exclusion zone remains in force on the river while experts make safe the sea mine which was spotted on Monday. It is thought to be a British mine, dating from the  1940s or 1950s. The evacuation affected three streets, with wider safety advice issued to residents within 500m of the device. There was also an exclusion zone at sea of about half a mile, and small boat owners were told not to sail during the operation. Caledonian MacBrayne reported some disruption to ferry services, affecting sailings from Gourock and Rothesay. Ch Insp Elliot Brown, the local area commander for Inverclyde, stressed that the evacuation had been a precautionary measure, and that there was no immediate danger to the community of Gourock. Lt Cdr Tim Castrinoyannakis, the officer in charge of the Royal Navy's Northern Diving Unit, said that due to the deterioration of the mine it was not possible to conclude how much explosive material it still contained. He said that because of this it was decided to move it to a safer place before dealing with it. Inverclyde Council said: "Thanks to residents and businesses in Gourock for their patience while the cordon and safe evacuation procedures were carried out today."	Residents are returning to their homes after an operation to move an unexploded mine discovered in the Firth of Clyde.
Yet that is what happened to Anthony Fletcher back in 2009, when at work one day he tried some nuts, seeds and dried fruit that had been delivered in the post by a new company called Graze. Graze had been set up a year earlier by seven friends as an internet-based business that posted healthy snacks in cardboard boxes small enough to fit through people's letter boxes. Then aged 27 and working for a drinks company, Anthony says he was "blown away by the idea of it". So much so that he immediately found out where Graze was based, drove across London to knock on its door and asked for a job. The team at Graze were impressed enough by Anthony's get-up-and-go and enthusiasm to give him the job of head of marketing. Fast forward to today and Anthony is chief executive of the business that now enjoys annual sales of more than Â£70m and that under his leadership has successfully expanded from the UK to the US. With a masters degree in chemistry from Oxford University, and a year spent doing pharmaceutical research at Princeton University in the US, Anthony might not immediately seem a perfect fit for leading a snack food business. However, while Graze's food is all natural, the company is renowned for its very scientific and technological approach to how it operates. Now selling more than 400 different snacks, ranging from flapjacks to beef jerky, and dried beetroot to carrot crisps, it constantly analyses the 15,000 customer ratings it says it receives every hour to tweak and develop new products and product combinations. This has led to the creation of such best sellers as "Veggie Protein Power", a combination of soybeans and chickpeas. Meanwhile unpopular products such as fennel and caraway seeds can be quickly dropped. Not that Anthony would claim it was always plain sailing, especially in Graze's early years. "Lots of founders and chief executives tell beautiful stories about having the right vision from the start, but it wasn't the case at Graze," he says. "We had to iterate, we tried and we failed - we had to pivot a great deal. People were excited, but not about the product." One thing that Graze initially got wrong was to try to sell slices of fresh fruit, but Anthony says it had to be axed from the range because even though they "tried to ship it as fast as possible" it wasn't arriving with the customer in good enough condition. With its own production facility, Anthony says the business can put new products on sale within 24 hours. He says: "We have a vast amount of data that we can use to understand the product and the customer. "It lets you be reckless and try different ideas. That permeates the business." It was after he had been with the business for three years that Anthony became chief executive, when he led a management buyout in 2012. The move, which was backed by US private equity group Carlyle taking a majority stake in the business, saw three of the seven co-founders end their day-to-day involvement in the business but remain as shareholders. After selling direct to customers via a subscription service for its first six years, Anthony overhauled its business mode in 2014. While subscriptions would continue, customers could also start to make one-off purchases. An even bigger move that year was a successful leap into wholesale, with Graze products becoming available at UK retailers like Sainsbury's, Boots, WH Smith and Tesco. Anthony admits that the timing of the move into the bricks-and-mortar world was fortuitous, as supermarkets and other retailers were being put under pressure to remove confectionary products from the "impulse purchase" racks near the tills. "We were very lucky, there was some serendipity involved," he says. "The UK government was putting a big drive to remove sugar products from the till, and retailers faced a dilemma of knowing customers were tempted into purchases, but they used to make so much money off it." The next big move at Graze was its expansion into the US in 2015. Anthony says Graze knew it had to move fast to get to the market before rivals, so rather than try its luck in one state, it decided to launch in all 50 at the same time. The hope was that its focus on data and its quick response to customer feedback meant it would be able to produce a range of snack products that appealed to US tastes, even if at first some items were not successful. Thankfully for Graze this approached worked, and while it initially started selling its standard UK range in the US, Anthony says it quickly dropped items that US customers "hated", such as mango chutney, the UK curry condiment staple. More US-specific products were then quickly introduced, such as "Creamy Range Kern Pops", which is popcorn with a "creamy, zesty kick", and chocolate pecan pie. More The Boss features, which every week profile a different business leader from around the world: Taking his own path: The world's leading maze designer Fancy a four flowers or ginger fried pork pizza? The boss who lives as a medieval knight The bad news that inspired a woman's sparkling success Within three months of its US launch, Anthony says Graze had gained 100,000 customers - a number that has continued to grow. Toby Pickard, senior retail analyst at grocery research firm IGD, says there are three main reasons why Graze has become one of the UK's leading snack brands. "Convenience, its ability to personalise healthy snack deliveries to suit customers' personal preferences, as well as its ability to tailor new products for local markets," he says. On a day-to-day basis Anthony admits he finds it hard to balance being a boss of a company with 500 employees, with being a parent. "It's a challenge," says the father-of-two. "One of the most challenging aspects is international travel. It's demanding, I don't think there are any easy answers, you just have to manage." Part of that process is changing his management skills, and taking a step back. He says: "In the early days I was really involved in the decisions, but as the business has grown, I have become focused on not solving all the problems, but still being curious about the organisation and making it better."	Many of us can remember a key moment that transformed our lives, but it doesn't usually involve tasting snack foods.
The name of each cat killed by Robert Farmer, 26, was read out to him by the judge in Santa Clara Superior Court. One of the cats showed signs of having been sexually abused, experts said. Farmer committed the crimes in San Jose in 2015. He was found sleeping in his car in October that year with a dead cat in the centre console and chunks of fur elsewhere in the vehicle. The cats all went missing in the Cambrian Park area of San Jose in the autumn of 2015. Several pets were found dead, two of them in rubbish bins. The Mercury News website said that video footage from a security camera showed a young man taking a 17-year-old cat named GoGo. Residents pointed police to Farmer. GoGo was among the cats who were never found. Owner Miriam Petrova was at the court on Friday. She told NBC News: "We finally can say goodbye to every cat that was involved in this tragedy." Farmer admitted 21 felony counts of animal cruelty - killing 18 cats and wounding three - along with misdemeanour battery and being under the influence. A letter by him, read out by his lawyer, said: "It feels like another man committed these crimes, but I know it was me. It's so hard to grasp I did this. I stole a member of their family. The fact that I was out of my mind was no excuse." Santa Clara County Deputy District Attorney Alexandra Ellis dismissed the letter as an attempt to win leniency. "The judge agreed with my analysis. She sentenced him to 16 years, we can only hope it is long enough," she said. Farmer was also banned from owning or caring for a pet for 10 years after his release, and was given a restriction order keeping him away from Cambrian Park.	A man in California has been jailed for 16 years after admitting he stole and tortured cats, killing 18 of them.
Tashan Corpe, 27, died in Sedgemoor Road, Bath, on Sunday. Police have charged 30-year-old Josh Farnham of Old Fosse Road, Bath, with murder, grievous bodily harm with intent and actual bodily harm. Rachel Smith, 42, of Sedgemoor Road, has been charged with assisting an offender. Both appeared before Bristol Magistrates' Court on Wednesday. Mr Farnham and Ms Smith were remanded in custody to appear before Bristol Crown Court on Thursday. The crime scene is still cordoned off while officers gather evidence. Det Insp Mike Buck from Avon and Somerset Police said: "Our thoughts are with Tashan's family at this tragic time."	Two people have been charged after a man was stabbed to death in his home.
Archbishop of Westminster Vincent Nichols said Christians were the most persecuted people, but few of them would receive sanctuary in the UK. The government has said 20,000 refugees will be brought to Britain directly from refugee camps around Syria. But Cardinal Nichols said most Christians did not go into the camps. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today, Archbishop Nichols said: "I can see the point in going directly to the refugee camps, but in fact I think its unintended consequence will be that there will be few, if any, Christians coming to this country. "That is because for the most part Christian refugees do not go into the UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees) camps. They go to fellow Christian organisations." He added: "If we are going to deal purely with UNHCR according to their rules, then there can be no preference given to anybody on behalf of their faith and we will simply bypass the Christian refugees, not intentionally but in fact." It comes as the Archbishop of Wales, Dr Barry Morgan, will say that Britain has lost its sense of proportion in relation to the refugee crisis. In his Christmas sermon at Llandaff Cathedral in Cardiff he is expected to say that the "debate seems to be centred on how many refugees we should accept. We forget to ask, or perhaps we choose to forget, why there are so many refugees in the first place". The refugees being brought to the UK will be drawn from established refugee camps, initially as part of the Vulnerable Persons Relocation (VPR) scheme. More than 50 local authorities have taken a share of those who have already arrived. Alongside the VPR scheme, the UK has also granted asylum or other forms of protection to 1,868 Syrians in the year ending September 2015.	Christian refugees fleeing Syria are being bypassed by the UK government, the head of the Roman Catholic Church in England and Wales has said.
David Cameron was answering a question in the House of Commons from Democratic Unionist Party MP Nigel Dodds. Mr Dodds said legacy funding provided in the Fresh Start deal could help relieve financial pressures on police. He also said no-one should be allowed to rewrite the history of the Troubles. Mr Cameron said he would consider Mr Dodds's arguments, adding: "We need to make sure the policing of Northern Ireland continues to be properly resourced, not least because we continue to face a terrorist threat today." The government has set aside a total of Â£150m for bodies that are to investigate Troubles-related cases. But a failure by Stormont politicians to agree on how best to deal with the past has meant the money is on hold. Earlier this month, the Northern Ireland Office said no more cash would be made available to deal with police investigations into crimes of the past.	The prime minister has said he will "look carefully" at requests for money set aside for dealing with legacy cases to be released to Northern Ireland's police force.
Malala Yousafzai was attacked on her way home from school in Mingora, the region's main town. She came to public attention in 2009 by writing a diary for BBC Urdu about life under Taliban militants who had taken control of the valley. A Pakistani Taliban spokesman told the BBC they carried out the attack. Ehsanullah Ehsan told BBC Urdu that they attacked her because she was anti-Taliban and secular, adding that she would not be spared. Malala Yousafzai was travelling with at least one other girl when she was shot, but there are differing accounts of how events unfolded. By Orla GuerinBBC News, Islamabad The chilling attack on the young peace campaigner has been leading TV news bulletins here. Malala Yousafzai is one of the best-known schoolgirls in the country.  Young as she is, she has dared to do what many others do not - publicly criticise the Taliban. Malala's confident, articulate campaign for girls' education has won her admirers - and recognition - at home and abroad. She has appeared on national and international television, and spoken of her dream of a future Pakistan where education would prevail. Even by the standards of blood-soaked Pakistan, there has been shock at the shooting. It has been condemned by Pakistan's Prime Minister, Raja Pervez Ashraf, who sent a helicopter to transfer Malala to hospital in Peshawar. The head of Pakistan's Independent Human Rights Commission, Zohra Yusuf, said "this tragic attack on this courageous child" sends a very disturbing message to all those working for women and girls. One report, citing local sources, says a bearded gunman stopped a car full of schoolgirls, and asked for Malala Yousafzai by name, before opening fire. But a police official also told BBC Urdu that unidentified gunmen opened fire on the schoolgirls as they were about to board a van or bus. She was hit in the head and, some reports say, in the neck area by  a second bullet, but is now in hospital and is reportedly out of danger.  Another girl who was with her at the time was also injured. Malala Yousafzai was just 11 when she was writing her diary, two years after the Taliban took over the Swat Valley, and ordered girls' schools to close. In the diary, which she kept for the BBC's Urdu service under a pen name, she exposed the suffering caused by the militants as they ruled. She used the pen-name Gul Makai when writing the diary. Her identity only emerged after the Taliban were driven out of Swat and she later won a national award for bravery and was also nominated for an international children's peace award. Correspondents say she earned the admiration of many across Pakistan for her courage in speaking out about life under the brutal rule of Taliban militants. One poignant entry reflects on the Taliban decree banning girls' education:  "Since today was the last day of our school, we decided to play in the playground a bit longer. I am of the view that the school will one day reopen but while leaving I looked at the building as if I would not come here again." She has since said that she wants to study law and enter politics when she grows up. "I dreamt of a country where education would prevail," she said. The BBC's Orla Guerin in Islamabad says that Malala Yousafzai was a public figure who didn't shy away from risks and had strong support from her parents for her activism. Indeed, her father, who is a school teacher, expressed his pride in her campaigning. In a statement about the attack, Pakistani Prime Minister Raja Pervez Ashraf said: "We have to fight the mindset that is involved in this. We have to condemn it... Malala is like my daughter, and yours too. If that mindset prevails, then whose daughter would be safe?" After the Taliban: Swat women on changing life The Taliban, under the notorious militant cleric Maulana Fazlullah, took hold of the Swat Valley in late 2007 and remained in de facto control until they were driven out by Pakistani military forces during an offensive in 2009. While in power they closed girls' schools, promulgated their extreme version of Sharia law and introduced measures such as banning the playing of music in cars. Since they were ejected, there have been isolated militant attacks in Swat but the region has largely remained stable and many of the thousands of people who fled during the Taliban years have returned.	Gunmen have wounded a 14-year-old rights activist who has campaigned for girls' education in the Swat Valley in north-west Pakistan.
Brook, the IBF welterweight champion, will jump two weight divisions to fight undisputed world middleweight champion Golovkin in London on 10 September. Sheffield's Brook, 30, is one of 14 current British world champions. "Beating Golovkin would make me the best pound-for-pound boxer in the world," Brook told BBC Sport. "When we only had one or two world champions, the reaction when you won a world title was: 'Yes, unbelievable for Britain.' But now it's more a case of: 'Oh, someone else has won a world title.' "No-one is shocked any more. So you do have to do something outrageous to stand out. "I've wanted to be the best since I was a little kid. Imagine me beating him and taking those belts to be the best pound-for-pound fighter in the world. It would be unbelievable." Brook is unbeaten in 36 professional contests and has made three defences of the IBF welterweight belt he won from American Shawn Porter in 2014. However, Brook was criticised for the quality of, or more correctly lack of, his recent opponents before signing to fight Kazakhstan knockout artist Golovkin. The 34-year-old is unbeaten in 35 pro contests and has 32 early victories to his name, giving him a knockout percentage of 91%, the highest in the history of the world middleweight championship. "There's a buzz in the air with this fight - it's a mega-fight," said Brook, who weighed 176lb at a check weight 30 days before the fight, 16lb over the middleweight limit and 11lb more than Golovkin. "It isn't just a world champion fighting a world champion, it's the biggest fight you can make in world boxing. "You've got two unbeaten fighters with a lot of knockouts between them going up against each other. "It's ludicrous a guy is jumping up two divisions to face somebody no one will fight. It's got everything and that's why everyone needs to tune in." Brook is bidding to succeed where domestic rival Amir Khan failed - Bolton's Khan jumped two weight divisions to fight then WBC champion Saul Alvarez in May and was knocked out in six rounds. Golovkin, who owns the WBA, WBC and IBF titles, is one of the most avoided boxers in the world - Mexico's Alvarez chose to vacate his WBC title rather than fight him.	Kell Brook says he chose to fight Gennady Golovkin because he needed to do something "outrageous" to stand out from the crowd.
Speaking to the Atlantic magazine, he said the operation went as well as he had hoped, but Libya was now "a mess". The article also said he had warned the PM the UK would have to pay its "fair share" and spend 2% of GDP on defence. In response, Number 10 said there were "many difficult challenges" in Libya, while the White House said it deeply valued the UK's contributions. Downing Street did not comment on President Obama's remark to the PM about defence spending, reportedly made before Chancellor George Osborne said the government would fulfil a Nato pledge to spend 2% of national income on defence last year. In response to the interview, a spokesman for the US National Security Council said Mr Cameron had been "as close a partner as the president has had" adding that "we deeply value the UK's contributions on our shared national security and foreign policy objectives". BBC North America editor Jon Sopel said the unsolicited statement put out by the White House suggested Downing Street had reacted angrily to the article. "It's like we've seen a curtain drawn back on the unspun thoughts of President Obama, complete with frustration as well, and what we've seen tonight is the White House trying to close the curtain as quickly as it can," he added. The toppling of the Gaddafi regime in Libya - following UN-backed air strikes designed to protect civilians - led to a power vacuum and instability, with no authority in full control. The intervention was led by the UK and France - and in his interview, Mr Obama reflects on "what went wrong", saying: "There's room for criticism, because I had more faith in the Europeans, given Libya's proximity, being invested in the follow-up." Mr Cameron, he said, became "distracted by a range of other things". He also criticised former French President Nicolas Sarkozy, saying he had tried to claim the spotlight. The former French president, he said, "wanted to trumpet the flights he was taking in the air campaign, despite the fact that we had wiped out all the air defences and essentially set up the entire infrastructure" for the intervention. President Obama said the intervention "averted large-scale civilian casualties (and) prevented what almost surely would have been a prolonged and bloody civil conflict". But he added: "And despite all that, Libya is a mess." He also criticised what he called "free riders" in the interview, saying European and Gulf countries were calling for action against Gaddafi, adding: "But what has been a habit over the last several decades in these circumstances is people pushing us to act but then showing an unwillingness to put any skin in the game." Despite efforts to support Libya's National Transitional Council, and the first elections in the country for decades, it rapidly descended into violence, with two rival governments and the formation of hundreds of militias, some allied to so-called Islamic State. In January, Mr Cameron told MPs the "Libyan people were given the opportunity" to build a stable democracy - and it was a matter of "huge regret" they had not taken it. He stressed that - unlike in Iraq - the post-conflict planning was locally driven. "Gaddafi was bearing down on people in Benghazi and threatening to shoot his own people like rats," he said. "An international coalition came together to protect those people and to help the Libyan people, who then got rid of Gaddafi. "And they had an opportunity to build what they said they wanted." Responding to President Obama's interview, Downing Street said "coming to the aid of innocent civilians who were being tortured and killed by their leader was the right thing to do". The government has tried to support stability in Libya and is "working hard to support the UN-led process to establish a stable and inclusive government that will allow them to build a peaceful future", a spokesman said. "But ultimately a positive outcome for Libya is not just up to the international community - this process needs to be led by the Libyan people," he added. The US National Security Council spokesman added: "With respect to Libya, the president has long said that all of us - including the United States - could have done more in the aftermath of the Libyan intervention." He said the UK had "stepped up on a range of issues" including meeting the 2% commitment and pressing other Nato members to do the same. Former Conservative Foreign Secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind said it was "a bit rich" for the US president to single out the UK and France, as they had carried out more air operations in the Libya campaign than any other country. 15 February 2011 - Protests against Colonel Gaddafi's regime erupt in Libya 20 February - Anti-Gaddafi rebels seize control of Libya's second city Benghazi 21 February - David Cameron, on a tour of the Middle East, condemns violence by the Gaddafi regime.

All examples of this group, known as the Archosauromorpha, lay eggs. This led some scientists to wonder whether there was something in their biology that prevented live births. But examination of the fossil remains of a very long-necked, 245 million-year-old marine reptile from China revealed it was carrying an embryo. Jun Liu, first author of the new study in Nature Communications, told BBC News that the animal would have measured between three and four metres long, with a neck that was about 1.7m long. The embryo may have been around half a metre long and is positioned inside the rib cage of the adult Dinocephalosaurus fossil, which was discovered in 2008 in Luoping County, Yunnan Province in southern China. Researchers had to consider whether the smaller animal might have been part of the adult's last meal. But it's facing forward, whereas swallowed prey generally face backwards because predators consume the animal head first to help it go down the throat. Another line of evidence in favour of the live birth idea is that the small reptile inside the mother is clearly an example of the same species. Co-author Prof Mike Benton, from the University of Bristol, told BBC News that the fossil was important because the Archosauromorpha form one of three large groupings of land-based vertebrates (backboned animals), each including about 10,000 species. Since we now know that no fundamental biological barrier to live births exists in this group, palaeontologists would be "looking very closely" at other fossils. He suggested one target would be a group of aquatic crocodile relatives - whose mode of reproduction was not well known. Prof Liu, from Hefei University of Technology in China, said the discovery pushes back evidence of reproductive biology in the archosauromorphs by 50 million years. The mode of reproduction in Dinocephalosaurus also points to how the sex of its offspring was determined. Co-author Prof Chris Organ, from Montana State University, added: "Some reptiles today, such as crocodiles, determine the sex of their offspring by the temperature inside the nest. "We identified that Dinocephalosaurus, a distant ancestor of crocodiles, determined the sex of its babies genetically, like mammals and birds." Prof Benton explained: "This combination of live birth and genotypic sex determination seems to have been necessary for animals such as Dinocephalosaurus to become aquatic. "It's great to see such an important step forward in our understanding of the evolution of a major group coming from a chance fossil find in a Chinese field." The possibility that an eggshell once surrounded the embryo but was not preserved in fossilisation could not be ruled out, said Prof Benton. But living Archosauromorphs all lay eggs very early in embryonic development, whereas this embryo is very advanced, with well developed bones. Furthermore, the team says Dinocephalosaurus's long neck and other features of its anatomy suggest it could not have manoeuvred easily out of the water, meaning a reproductive strategy like that of turtles - which lay eggs on land before returning to the water - was probably not an option.

Sakho, who is currently on loan at Crystal Palace, tested positive for the fat burner higenamine in March 2017 and served a provisional 30-day suspension. Uefa dismissed the case in July. European football's governing body blamed "gaps in communication" between Wada and two of its laboratories. A Uefa report released on Thursday said it was "clearly not possible" for anyone to tell whether higenamine is a prohibited substance by reading Wada's banned list. "The fact that the Cologne laboratory tested for higenamine but had to check with Wada before making a determination indicates a problem, as does the fact that the Lausanne laboratory does not test for it," it added. "The onus is clearly on Wada to communicate to its laboratories what is and what is not on the prohibited list. "There are clearly gaps in communication with regard to higenamine, something which also tends to support the suggestion that Wada's own internal procedure and analysis in respect of this substance is incomplete." Sakho, 27, admitted taking the substance without Liverpool's knowledge but contended it was not on the banned list, which was supported by the report into the case by Uefa's control, ethics and disciplinary body. The France international has not played for Liverpool since testing positive and moved to Palace on loan in February.	Liverpool centre-back Mamadou Sakho was suspended last season for taking a substance that was not on the World Anti-Doping Agency's (Wada) banned list, according to a Uefa report.
The Star Wars superfan made £15,000 selling a single Boba Fett figure, and now he's selling another 15 rare items. Craig Stevens sold the pristine, unopened bounty hunter toy at auction house Vectis last month. Now the next batch of his galactic goods are expected to fetch between £28,000 to £40,000. The most highly valued item this time is a Palitoy FX-7 medical droid from The Empire Strikes Back. A similar item sold last year for around £8,400. What makes his profit margins seem more out of this world, is that the Boba Fett figure would have set you back £1.50 in 1980. If you're reading this thinking it's a no-brainer for Craig, he agrees. He said: "I'm living in a rented flat in my home town. You think to yourself, 'I'm in a flat and I've got a box of figures worth as much as a house'. "There's no contest really." He might even be able to run to a swimming pool - he's got 10,000 more items in his collection of Star Wars memorabilia. Follow @BBCNewsbeat on Twitter, BBCNewsbeat on Instagram and Radio1Newsbeat on YouTube	Most collectors would probably tell you they couldn't put a price on their beloved collectables, but Craig Stevens probably had to re-think that one.
The 27-year-old Scot, who is back at number four in the world after dropping down the rankings following back surgery, is to marry girlfriend Kim Sears in April. Murray is as relaxed about that as he has been this week at the ATP event in Indian Wells, where he has progressed to the quarter-finals. He loosened up in more ways than one as he chatted to BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller and BBC Scotland's Kheredine Idessane in the commentary box... "It is three weeks on Saturday, that's all I know. Tennis players aren't normally very good with dates. "We just know it is the Indian Wells week or the Monte Carlo week or whatever. So I know it is the weekend before Monte Carlo and the weekend after Miami. "We will probably do the honeymoon later in the year, probably in the off-season. I am not sure where we're going to go yet, but there's a few ideas. "I am actually not nervous about getting married because we've been together like nine-and-a-half years and we've lived together for six or seven years as well. "So I don't think a whole lot's going to change. I kind of feel like we have been married already in terms of the way we spend our lives together and live together. "I think I will be more nervous about starting a family because that would be more life-changing, in a good way." "My brother Jamie's one. Ross Hutchins is also going to be a best man and hopefully a good friend in Barcelona [Peruvian Carlos Mier, who was Murray's room-mate at the Sanchez-Casal Academy]. "But I'm not sure yet if he [Mier] is going to be able to come. He's in Singapore just now and I'm going to try to get him over. "Kim has four bridesmaids and no maid of honour and I was saying, 'imagine you had to pick one of your four best friends you've had since you were at school'. "It is very, very difficult to choose one. She was like 'go on, pick one', but I said no. "I didn't spend a lot of time with my brother when we were 15 to 20 really, because he was training in France and I was training in Spain. "Carlos, he was my best friend during that time, which were very important years in my life, when I moved away from my family and friends. "He was the guy who was always there for me. I feel like he knows me extremely well. "My brother obviously knows me from a child - and Ross over the last six or seven years. We've become extremely close and been through a lot together as well. "Picking one was a very difficult thing to do because I had three guys that were clearly my three best friends and I would like all them to be involved in some way." "It looks a lot easier from up here, that's for sure. It's extremely simple. Every shot looks easy when you're watching from the commentary box, but it certainly isn't. "The one thing I think I would do as a commentator is give more credit to the players, because I have a good idea how tricky the conditions are here. But I don't think I have the voice to be a good broadcaster."	It is a big year for Andy Murray - and not only because he is looking to add to his two Grand Slam titles.
Archery, fencing, weightlifting and wheelchair rugby have also missed out. Cycling - which brought Team GB 12 medals in Rio - has had its funding cut by more than £4m to £25.98m. Badminton England chief executive Adrian Christy said he was "staggered" by the "incomprehensible" decision to remove the sport's funding. A total of £345m will be invested in 31 Olympic and Paralympic sports - £2m less than the record £347m allocated for the Rio Games. As a result, UK Sport has set Team GB a target of winning 51-85 Olympic medals, and 115-162 Paralympic medals in Tokyo. Britain enjoyed unprecedented success at Rio 2016, with the Olympics yielding 67 medals and the Paralympics 147. Chair of UK Sport Rod Carr said the government, which provides funding alongside National Lottery money, has "confirmed its commitment" for Tokyo 2020. He added: "These are critical funding decisions for sports to take them on their journey to Tokyo 2020 and beyond so the historic success at Rio can be maintained." Badminton, which was set a target of winning a medal in Rio, is the only sport that earned a podium place in the summer to have its funding removed. Marcus Ellis and Chris Langridge took bronze in the men's doubles after the sport was given £5.74m in the last cycle. Christy said the decision represents a "catastrophic impact on the sport" and Badminton England would "fight for the hopes and dreams" of its players. "How can you return from the best Games for more than a decade, in a year where our players have demonstrated world-class performances and where we can demonstrate the journey to Tokyo is on track, only be to have every penny of investment withdrawn?" he said. "What have we done wrong?" added GB Badminton's performance director Jon Austin. Judo, which was given the same target as badminton and also claimed one bronze medal, has had its funding increased slightly. Liz Nicholl, CEO of UK Sport, said the decision to cut funding was not taken lightly. "We would like to invest in every sport but the reality is we have to prioritise to protect and enhance the medal potential," she said. "If we under-invest across the board then the British teams will ultimately underperform at the Games and medal success will be put at risk." Sports minister Tracey Crouch added: "UK Sport's approach to elite sport has proven successful in Beijing, London and Rio and the ambition to win more medals in Tokyo is a bold one that, if achieved, would mean a sensational summer of sport in 2020." Basketball had its funding withdrawn in 2014 - and handball and volleyball lost theirs in 2012 - but say a UK Sport review last year to build "performance pathways for future success" was supposed to be aimed at such sports. A British Basketball statement, in conjunction with volleyball and handball, said: "It appears that UK Sport has no interest in team sports and in particular refuses to take responsibility for the need to fund their performance development, which was identified in its own review. "With UK Sport's investment budget approaching £350m, it borders on intransigence to pass responsibility to government and other funding bodies who are not set up to fund the development of high-performance sport." UK Sport says investment in the five Olympic sports and two Paralympic sports added for Tokyo 2020 is yet to be confirmed. Baseball/softball will return to the programme, with karate, skateboard, sports climbing and surfing also added, while Para-taekwondo and Para-badminton join the Paralympic programme. UK Sport says funding will be determined "following further exploration of medal potential", with £9m of the £345m total still to be allocated. Liam Carroll, head coach of the GB baseball team, said: "The key to unlocking our potential is investment and I'm pleased that UK Sport has left the door open. "We look forward to the opportunity to impress upon them that getting behind Great Britain Baseball can extend their tremendous track record of investing in Olympic medal contenders."	Badminton is one of five sports to lose all UK Sport funding for the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo - after Britain claimed a bronze in the sport in Rio.
Media playback is not supported on this device The 31-year-old won the 13.1-mile race in 59 minutes, 32 seconds, to knock 20 seconds off the record set 14 years ago by Spain's Fabian Roncero. Farah, also world champion at 5,000m and 10,000m, beat Kenya's Micah Kogo. The world record of 58:23 was set by Eritrea's Zersenay Tadese in the 2010 edition of the Lisbon race. Farah's only world record is the two-mile indoor mark he set at the Birmingham Grand Prix last month. He clocked a time of one hour exactly in winning 2014's Great North Run, becoming the first British man to win the North East's famous half marathon for 29 years. Kenya's Kogo, the 10,000m bronze medallist from the Beijing Olympics in 2008, was one of six men lining up against Farah to have already run under 60 minutes for the distance. There was also British success in the wheelchair races for David Weir and Shelly Woods who continued their preparations for next month's London Marathon, which also doubles as the IPC World Championships. Weir beat Swiss rival Marcel Hug in a photo-finish while Woods got the better of British rival Jade Jones.	Double Olympic champion Mo Farah has won the Lisbon half marathon in a new European record time, becoming the first Briton to break 60 minutes.
The 35-year-old batsman will link up again with his ex-Black Caps team-mate Daniel Vettori, who was appointed Middlesex's Twenty20 coach on a three-year deal in December. McCullum worked under Vettori at Big Bash side Brisbane Heat this winter. Meanwhile, James Franklin, 36, has been made full-time captain in the County Championship and the One-Day Cup. Franklin took over the captaincy on an interim basis last season following an injury to Adam Voges and helped steer the club to their first Championship title since 1993. "It's a very exciting time for the club, getting Brendon back again after his stint with us last year," Franklin told BBC Radio London. "He's one of the best captains in world cricket of the modern age so it's going to be exciting for players to work with him. "And Dan being on board as the Twenty20 coach, I think it shows how progressive the club are looking at things. "To be able to get in a coach of his calibre is hugely exciting." Last season's T20 Blast captain Dawid Malan, 29, has been named vice-captain in that format and will lead the side when McCullum, who has re-signed for nine group games, is unavailable.	Former New Zealand skipper Brendan McCullum has been named Middlesex captain for this season's T20 Blast.
Forfar are seven points clear of Arbroath, who move above Elgin City by beating them 3-2. Edinburgh City extended their unbeaten league run to seven matches with a 0-0 draw at Clyde's Broadwood Stadium. Montrose won 2-1 away to Berwick Rangers, while Stirling Albion beat Annan Athletic to move off bottom spot. Fraser Mullen's free-kick gave Cowden the lead against Forfar, but Lewis Milne headed the visitors level. Swankie's first strike of the day temporarily gave his side the lead, only for Mullen to convert another free-kick. Kris Renton's strike put the hosts back in front, Josh Peters fired Forfar level again and Swankie's left-foot shot in stoppage time settled the match. There was also late drama at Gayfield, where Elgin moved into a two-goal lead through strikes by Brian Cameron and Chris McLeish. Bryan Prunty headed Arbroath back into the match and then set up Steven Doris to equalise. The hosts had on-loan Dundee United defender Jassem Sukar sent off for a second booking and Elgin's Thomas Reilly suffered the same fate. There was a further twist in the tale as Keiran Stewart fouled Colin Hamilton and Doris converted the resulting penalty. It was an early spot-kick that gave Annan the lead at Forthbank Stadium, Max Wright scoring after Ross Smith had impeded Aidan Smith. Darren Lee Smith's strike and Ross McMillan's header turned the match in Stirling's favour in the first half and Dylan Nguene Bikey fired Albion's clinching goal 15 minutes from the end. Ryan Ferguson and substitute Jonny Court netted either side of Michael McKenna's leveller as Montrose claimed their second consecutive win over Berwick, with all three goals coming in the second half.	Gavin Swankie's late winner gave Scottish League Two leaders Forfar Athletic a 4-3 win over Cowdenbeath, who sink to the foot of the table.
The man, who has not yet been formally identified, was discovered in a wooded area near the Goodwyns housing estate in Dorking on Monday. Surrey Police has been given more time to question a 21-year-old male arrested on suspicion of murder. The force is awaiting the results of a post-mortem examination.	Extra time has been granted to detectives quizzing a murder suspect over the discovery of a body in a stream.
The victims all worked at the plant 100km (62 miles) east of Porto. The factory's owner was among the dead and several members of his family were either dead or missing, said local mayor Francisco Lopes. Some of the victims were found outside the factory, apparently propelled from the building by the force of the blast. An initial explosion happened shortly after 17:30 (16:30 GMT) on Tuesday, followed by two more blasts, reports said. Five bodies were found late on Tuesday and emergency workers found a sixth victim some 200m (650ft) from the site, minister Jorge Gomes told Portuguese media. The search was being extended to a radius of 800m, he added, because of the scale of the explosion. The factory was described as a family business. As investigators tried to identify the victims, the mayor said that almost all of the eight caught up in the blast were members of Egas Sequeira's family. Mr Sequeira was among those feared dead along with one of his daughters and a son-in-law, Portuguese media said. The owner's wife had left the building just before the explosion and survived but two other family members were among the missing. Officials were initially unable to enter the site because of the potential risk to their safety. Portuguese President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa was due to visit the scene on Wednesday.	Six people died and another two were missing after an explosion on Tuesday evening destroyed a fireworks factory near the Portuguese town of Lamego.
Samantha Ho, 39, was found in Curlew Place, St Neots, Cambridgeshire, on Saturday. Her husband Timothy Allen, 40, is due to go on trial in Cambridge for her murder next year. It was previously reported Mr Allen was Ms Ho's partner. Mr Allen was due to appear via video link at the Old Bailey, but it was decided he did not have to attend. His first Crown Court hearing went ahead in his absence. Judge Mark Lucraft QC set a provisional plea and case management hearing for 13 November at the Old Bailey. He said the trial at Cambridge Crown Court should be before a high court judge. A provisional two-week trial has been set to start on 22 February. No application for bail was made.	The man accused of beheading a scientist was her husband, it has emerged.
The announcement follows last week's warning that a vast area of China would be badly hit by pollution. Beijing saw its second red alert over the weekend. The latest wave of alerts includes the industrial port Tianjin. Red alerts trigger advisories for people to stay inside, schools to stop classes, and restrict vehicle use. An environmental ministry statement issued on  Wednesday night said the 10 cities with red alerts include Tianjin as well as smaller surrounding cities Puyang, Xinxiang, Dezhou, Handan, Xintai, Langfang, Hengshui, Xinji and Anyang. They are among 30 cities including Beijing seeing "severe pollution". Another 20 cities have "heavy pollution". The latest news was met with resignation, and even some jokes, by Chinese netizens who have endured bad air quality levels in recent weeks. On Wednesday, images of  a purple-tinged sunset in Nanjing spread across social media with many users attributing it to the pollution in the city. "New type of haze: grape flavoured," joked Weibo user Chenyingshisupoman. Another Weibo user Diliutianmaoxianjia said sarcastically: "Compared to the heavy smog of Beijing, the strong smog of Hebei, and damp heat of Shanghai, I prefer the colours of Nanjing's smog... it is durable and refreshing... once you breathe it in it sticks to your heart." Beijing's second red alert ended on Tuesday night. The ministry said the capital's air quality was "slowly improving". But some parts of neighbouring Henan and Hebei regions were still seeing heavy pollution, with levels of the PM2.5 pollutant surpassing 300 mg per cubic metre - the hazardous level in China. China has seen extremely high levels of air pollution in recent years, particularly in the coal-reliant north east, the industrial heart of the country. Following criticism that authorities were not doing enough to protect citizens' health, the government has stepped up in issuing health advisories and promised to take action to address pollution.	Hazardous smog blanketing China's north-east has sparked more red alerts, with authorities advising residents in 10 cities to stay indoors.
The Serbian FA has been charged with alleged racist chanting by fans and both associations over the behaviour of players at the end of the game. Violent scenes erupted shortly after Connor Wickham scored in the 90th minute to give England a 1-0 win. The cases will be discussed at the next ordinary hearing of the Uefa Control and Disciplinary Body on 22 November. A Uefa statement read: "Uefa has opened disciplinary proceedings against both the Football Association of Serbia (FSS) and England's Football Association (FA) following a number of incidents during and after England's 1-0 win over Serbia in the 2013 Uefa European Under-21 Championship play-off second leg at the Mladost stadium in Krusevac on Tuesday 16 October 2012. Media playback is not supported on this device "Regarding alleged racist chanting, Uefa will instigate proceedings against the FSS over the misconduct of their supporters during and at the end of the match. Proceedings will also be instigated against the FSS for the improper conduct of the Serbia players at the end of the match. "Uefa will also commence proceedings against the FA for the improper conduct of the England players at the end of the match." Moments after Wickham's strike, which ensured Stuart Pearce's side qualified for Euro 2013, a series of scuffles between players and staff on both sides broke out as missiles were thrown on to the field. Sunderland's Danny Rose was sent off after the final whistle for kicking the ball away in reaction to the abuse he was receiving. He later claimed the abuse was racial. However, the Serbian FA released a statement on Wednesday saying a connection between the on-pitch scuffles and racism had "absolutely no ground" and also blamed Rose for the clashes because of "inappropriate, unsportsmanlike and vulgar" behaviour. The FA rejects that version of the events and urged Uefa to take the "strongest possible action" against anyone found guilty of racism. FA general secretary Alex Horne said: "Our players and staff were subjected to racial abuse, violence as well as missiles being thrown at them throughout the match. "What occurred is inexcusable and not acceptable. We are making a formal complaint to Uefa today. "We call on Uefa to take the strongest possible action against the Serbian FA, their supporters and anyone found guilty of being involved in the numerous instances of violence and abuse."	Uefa has charged the Football Associations of England and Serbia in the wake of Tuesday's Under-21 match.
A new survey shows an overall increase of 11% in dog mess on UK beaches - it's gone up 71% in Scotland. Dog poo is dangerous because it contains high levels of bacteria - if it gets into water it can be very bad for bathers' health. Almost 4,500 volunteers took part in the survey by The Marine Conservation Society - across 335 UK beaches. The society says that pet owners have been thinking ahead by carrying plastic bags to clear up dog mess - which is a good thing. But it now wants to encourage them to take the bags off the beach and bin it in one of the many dog bins provided. Even though levels of dog poo were up, there was some good news: overall litter levels were down this year.	Pet owners who bag up dog poo and leave it on beaches are threatening the safety of people who visit the seaside.
Some have seen increases of as much as 900% after a recent revaluation and the situation has been called "ridiculous". It means virtually all of their profits are being handed over to councils, with some energy schemes now making a loss, BBC Wales has heard. The Welsh Government said it was aware and considering the case for specific assistance. The British Hydropower Association accused ministers of "sitting on their hands" while Community Energy Wales said it was "ripping the guts" out of projects. Community energy schemes are often small enterprises run by volunteers, designed to generate income for their area. But the way business rates are calculated means hydro schemes are hit hard: Business rates in England and Wales are calculated by an independent body - the Valuation Office Agency - but the Welsh Government is in charge of how they are raised here. The British Hydropower Association has written to Finance Secretary Mark Drakeford to ask for support. Chief executive Simon Hamlyn said: "Community hydro schemes are suffering and those businesses will say we can't afford to pay these rates and they'll abandon these schemes and that's the last thing we want." Keith Jones, director of Community Energy Wales, said the average increase was 300%. "No-one could foresee this coming, we didn't even put it down as a risk in our business plans that such a blunt instrument would be used to get more money out of us." Mr Jones said the Scottish government had extended a 100% business rates relief for community energy schemes while in England they were capping the increase at £600. Gavin Gatehouse helps run the Ynni Anafon hydro scheme in Abergwyngregyn, Gwynedd, which has seen its monthly rate rise from about £900 to more than £2,000. It took five years to set up and could generate up to £40,000 of disposable income per year for projects in the area. A charity has been formed so groups and individuals can apply for grants, but this increase means there will be less money to hand out. The community hydro at Bethesda is predicting it will now make a loss. "It's very frustrating and I'm very angry about it," Mr Gatehouse said. "We'll be seeing a huge proportion of our profit eaten away to substitute for lack of government provision of grants to local authorities." Mr Drakeford has said more than £210m of rate relief was being provided for 2017-18 to businesses including community energy projects. "We are going to prepare a new scheme for rate relief for small business from 2018 onwards.  I am happy, as part of this, to consider the case for specific assistance and support for some projects, including the community energy projects and community hydro projects." The Green Party said it would remove subsidies to fossil fuels and scrap "regressive taxes" on the community energy sector. Welsh Liberal Democrats pledged to review business rates exemptions and make a presumption in favour of renewable energy projects "in or on suitable publicly owned buildings and land". Plaid Cymru's shadow cabinet secretary for energy, Simon Thomas, said his party would introduce a rates relief package and loans for pre-planning application costs, which would only be repaid if planning consent was given.	The future of many community hydro schemes is in jeopardy due to a sharp rise in business rates, operators say.
Scientists and charities say the human papilloma virus (HPV) jab will protect them from head and neck cancers. HPV is sexually transmitted and girls aged 12 and 13 receive the vaccine to protect them against cervical cancer. The Welsh government said it is waiting for advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation. Charities including Tenovus Cancer Care and organisations such as BMA Cymru and Cardiff University's HPV research team will deliver a letter to the Welsh government on Monday calling for the vaccination to be rolled out. They told BBC Radio Wales' Eye on Wales programme the number of head and neck cancer cases are increasing. Dr Mererid Evans, consultant oncologist at Velindre Hospital in Cardiff, said: "I've seen a difference in demographics over the last ten years. "These are younger people with families, and three-quarters of those affected are men. The average age is 55 and most are non-smokers." Jon Antoniazzi, from Tenovus Cancer Care, added: "HPV causes 5% of the global cancer burden. "What the Welsh government could be doing right now is taking a progressive step to stem the tide of these cancers, and show that it really takes the public health of its citizens seriously. "We urge them to diverge from central thinking and vaccinate boys now." In 2008, a vaccination programme was rolled out in schools and 85% of girls in Wales have been vaccinated. The Welsh government said: "We will await the committee's recommendations and will consider the implications for Wales of any proposed changes to the HPV vaccination programme."	Boys should receive a cancer vaccine - already given to young girls - to stop them developing strains of the disease, experts have said.
Bomb disposal officers were sent to Birmingham's Lee Bank area on Friday and nearby roads were closed and cordoned off. The men, two aged 32 and 37 were arrested in Stoke-on-Trent and three others, aged 18, 24 and 28, were arrested in Birmingham. Magistrates granted police a further seven days to question the men. Detectives from the West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit appeared before London's Westminster Magistrates' Court via video link on Saturday to submit their request for a warrant of further detention, a spokesman said. The men were arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism. Ch Supt Sue Southern, from West Midlands Police, said: "The arrests of the five men were intelligence led and our investigation continues at full pace." A number of properties in the Stoke and Birmingham areas have been searched as part of the investigation. The BBC understands the force was dealing with two suspect devices that were found at a business in Lee Bank on Friday.	Police have been given more time to question five men arrested on suspicion of terrorism offences.
The Labour leader told the New Statesman his party opposed government plans to lower the overall household cap, introduced in the last Parliament. And his spokesman confirmed he was "very much in favour" of getting rid of it altogether. The Conservatives said Labour wanted a return to "unlimited welfare handouts". The BBC's Carole Walker said Mr Corbyn was asserting his authority on what was a "very difficult issue" for the party. After Mr Corbyn told the TUC conference last week he wanted to "remove the whole idea of the benefit cap", Owen Smith, his shadow work and pensions secretary, said it was "very clear" Labour was only opposing plans to reduce the limit of working-age benefits to £20,000, and to £23,000 in London. In an interview with the BBC's Newsnight, Mr Smith acknowledged the principle of a welfare cap had wide public support and it would be "foolhardy" for Labour to set themselves "unthinkingly" against public opinion. But Mr Corbyn told the New Statesman the cap was responsible for "social cleansing" in his Islington North constituency, with people forced to leave their homes because they could not afford their rent. "It's devastating for children, devastating for the family and very bad for the community as a whole," he added. His spokesman said Mr Corbyn had "laid out his position" and the policy would now go through a "collective decision-making process". Speaking on Wednesday, Mr Smith said the party leader had "clearly signalled that he wants Labour to review and refresh our thinking on social security, especially in respect of the benefit cap, and that's a challenge I know the entire party will rise to in the months ahead". Before Mr Corbyn was elected leader, the party was split over the Welfare Reform and Work Bill, which will reduce the cap to £20,000 outside of London, and £23,000 in London. In July, 48 Labour MPs rebelled against the decision by the then interim leader Harriet Harman to abstain and instead voted against the bill. The Conservative Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said "chaos and confusion" surrounded Labour's position. "Conservatives believe that nobody should be able to claim more in welfare than the average family earns by going out to work," he said. "By pledging to reverse this position, it's clear that today's Labour Party are simply not on the side of working people. They are still the same old welfare party  - wanting to borrow more to spend more on benefits." In his interview, Mr Corbyn also said scrapping the Trident nuclear weapons system would become Labour Party policy if its conference votes for the change next week. Conferences votes are not technically binding on the party leadership. But asked whether scrapping Trident would become party policy if conference votes for it, Mr Corbyn said: "Well, it would be, of course, because it would have been passed at conference."	Jeremy Corbyn has reaffirmed his desire to scrap the welfare cap after differences with his shadow cabinet, calling the policy "devastating".
A judge at the High Court in London ruled in favour of environmental lawyers ClientEarth. The group called air pollution a "public health crisis" and said the government has failed to tackle it. The ruling in the judicial review called the government's plan "woefully inadequate". The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) told the BBC that it accepted the court's judgment. ClientEarth won a separate, Supreme Court ruling against the government in April 2015. That judgment ordered ministers to come up with a plan to bring down air pollution to within legal limits as soon as possible. But ClientEarth was dissatisfied with those proposals, and took the government to the High Court in a judicial review. In the ruling on Wednesday morning, Mr Justice Garnham said the 2015 Air Quality Plan (AQP), devised when Liz Truss MP was Environment Secretary, failed to comply with the Supreme Court judgment and EU directives. Furthermore, the ruling said the government had erred in law by fixing compliance dates based on over-optimistic modelling of pollution levels. "It seems to me plain that by the time the plan was introduced the assumptions underlying the Secretary of State's assessment of the extent of likely future non-compliance had already been shown to be markedly optimistic," said Mr Justice Garnham. He said the Secretary of State "fell into error" by fixing on a projected compliance date of 2020 (and 2025 for London). In particular, he drew attention to the cost implications of bringing in Clean Air Zones no earlier than 2020. "The evidence demonstrates clearly that Clean Air Zones, the measure identified in the plan as the primary means of reducing nitrogen dioxide emissions, could be introduced more quickly than 2020," Mr Justice Garnham said. He continued: "I have also seen a document setting out questions for Defra from HM Treasury dated 18 August 2015; one question asks why the money required 'needs to be spent over two years?' "The answer given is 'spend does not have to be over two years, nine years is more realistic given that London does not need to be in compliance until 2025'." A raft of recent studies and reports have linked air pollution to heart disease and lung problems, including asthma. In February, the Royal Colleges of Physicians and of Paediatrics and Child Health said outdoor air pollution was contributing to some 40,000 early deaths a year in the UK. ClientEarth chief executive James Thornton commented: "This is an urgent public health crisis over which the Prime Minister must take personal control. "I challenge Theresa May to take immediate action now to deal with illegal levels of pollution and prevent tens of thousands of additional early deaths in the UK. The High Court has ruled that more urgent action must be taken." A spokesperson for Defra said its plans had always followed the best available evidence, adding: "Whilst our huge investment in green transport initiatives and plans to introduce Clean Air Zones around the country will help tackle this problem, we accept the court's judgment. "We will now carefully consider this ruling, and our next steps, in detail." The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said: "Today's High Court ruling brings sharply into focus the scale of the country's air pollution crisis and lays the blame at the door of the Government for its complacency in failing to tackle the problem quickly and credibly. "In so doing they have let down millions of people the length and breadth of the country." Follow Paul on Twitter.	Campaigners have won the latest battle in legal action against the UK Government over levels of air pollution.
Resuming on 193-7, still needing 65 to make the visitors bat again, Leach (90) and Barnard (42) put on 100 to help Worcestershire post 349. Leach then claimed two wickets to leave the Foxes wobbling on 43-2. But Paul Horton (75*) and Mark Cosgrove (58*) saw Leicestershire to the close on 172-2, a healthy lead of 230. In company with fellow former Shropshire all-rounder Barnard, Leach fell just 10 runs short of his first century for three years. Despite Leicestershire all-rounder Clint McKay taking a tidy 4-59 from 24.1 overs, it left Worcestershire only 58 in arrears on first innings. Leach then broke through in each of his opening two overs as Angus Robson slashed a delivery to point before first-innings centurion Neil Dexter was brilliantly stumped by Ben Cox. But captain Cosgrove and former Lancashire skipper Horton got on top to leave the visitors, who started the game 13 points ahead of the home side in fourth, pushing for a third Championship win of the campaign. Worcestershire all-rounder Joe Leach told BBC Hereford & Worcester: "It has been pretty good old-fashioned attritional cricket throughout the day. The pitch dictates that to a certain extent. It is not the quickest and with not much going on for the seam bowlers or the spinners. "We were up against it after the poor session we had on Monday evening so, to stay in the game, it was imperative that we had a good morning with the bat and got as close as we could to them. "It is mine and Ed Barnard's natural game to try and get on with it and, in the end, we can be satisfied with finishing 50-odd behind on first innings from the position we got ourselves into." Leicestershire all-rounder Clint McKay told BBC Radio Leicester: "It didn't go probably as well as we hoped this morning but that's cricket and they batted very well and we probably weren't at our best with the ball. The game drifted away from us quite a bit. "But we bounced back after lunch, got a couple of quick wickets and batted quite nicely in the final session to set ourselves up for going into day four. "With my four wickets, there were a couple of lucky ones in there but it is a hard slog. You get wickets like that now and then.  It is all about running in and making it as hard as we can for the batters."	Leicestershire have the upper hand at New Road, despite Worcestershire being spared a possible innings defeat by Joe Leach and Ed Barnard's century stand.
He said it "makes sense" for pay to be handled by AMs and Welsh ministers as education is already devolved. The Welsh Government described the move - part of planned changes to the Wales Bill which sets out the next steps for Welsh devolution - as "encouraging". But two major teaching unions say they are opposed to the idea, fearing lower pay than in England. The move is one of several improvements demanded by First Minister Carwyn Jones for the bill, which the Welsh Government says it is not yet ready to support. The announcement was made as the much-criticised bill, which makes significant changes to the way power is shared between Wales and Westminster, returned to the House of Lords for debate on Monday. "Education is a devolved matter, and it makes sense for the assembly and Welsh ministers to decide the pay and conditions of teachers' in Wales," Mr Cairns said. The amendment to the bill on teachers' pay will be debated next Monday. Powers over the community infrastructure levy - which allows councils to raise cash for local improvements - will also be devolved, Mr Cairns added, with further changes promised in the coming weeks. "I want a clear and lasting devolution settlement that works for Wales and for the UK as a whole," he said, adding he was happy to consider devolving further powers "where there's a clear purpose for doing so". However Geraint Davies, Wales official for the NASUWT union, said teachers in Wales were "best served by a continuous link with Westminster". He said: "We strongly believe that if pay and conditions were devolved there is every danger that teachers here could end up being paid less than across the border for doing the same job." Mr Davies added if wages were higher in England there was also a risk of teachers leaving Wales to further their careers. Owen Hathway, policy officer for NUT Cymru, also said his members were opposed to the move. "We are fearful that we will have terms and conditions that are depressed and will lead to lower wages," he said. "When you think there is a teaching shortage in England, if you pay them more in England it could lead to a brain drain of teachers going across the border. "But the political will is there for it to happen." Earlier in October, Mr Jones told Mr Cairns the UK government's approach to the legislation would "heavily" influence whether his government recommends the bill to the assembly - saying he was not yet ready to do so. A Welsh Government spokeswoman said: "As the first minister's recent letter to the Secretary of State (Alun Cairns) made clear, we are not currently in a position to support the bill and there are a number of obstacles still to overcome. "However, these are encouraging amendments from the UK Government, and we note with interest the promise of further changes in the coming weeks." During the debate concerns were also raised about a lack of power Wales has over it courts and prisons. Lord Wigley said it was not acceptable there was no crown court west of Swansea, or between Swansea and Caernarfon, and no crown court between Merthyr and Mold. He added: "Wales is able to decide on the siting of its schools and hospitals, but not on its courts and prisons." Baroness Morgan, shadow minister for Wales in the House of Lords, said it was premature to talk about establishing a separate legal jurisdiction for Wales, but said the issue did need to be addressed. Lord Wigley withdrew his amendment on legal jurisdiction, but said he hoped the focus would remain on such issues.	Control over teachers' pay and conditions will be devolved, Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns has announced.
This article contains language that some readers may find offensive. "So this week it's Robert E Lee," he said on Tuesday of the rebel general's monument that was a flashpoint for last Saturday's violent rally in Virginia. "I wonder, is it George Washington next week?" he asked journalists at Trump Tower. "And is it Thomas Jefferson the week after?" Let's put aside for a moment the irony that Lee may well have supported Charlottesville's plans to remove his bronze likeness, given that he urged the country to "obliterate the marks of civil strife" and refrain from erecting such monuments. As President Trump pointed out, George Washington was a slaveholder. So might the stone obelisk dedicated to the father of the nation, looming over the heart of his eponymous capital city, be the next battleground in the US culture wars? Or even Mount Rushmore? Washington conceded the system of human bondage that underpinned the economy of 18th Century Virginia was a "wicked, cruel and unnatural trade". He was the only founding father and commander-in-chief to liberate his slaves - he owned more than 300 - when he died. But as Ron Chernow's magisterial biography Washington: A Life makes clear, while he lived, the nation's first president extracted his pound of flesh from those whom he preferred to call his "servants", or "family". Washington saw himself as a benevolent master, but he did not tolerate suspected shirkers on his farm, even when they were pregnant, elderly or crippled. He once scolded a slave who pleaded that he could not work because his arm was in a sling. As Chernow writes, Washington picked up a rake and demonstrated how to use it with one arm. "If you use your hand to eat," he said, "why can't you use it to work?" He was not averse to shipping refractory slaves to the West Indies, such as one man named Waggoner Jack, where the tropical climate and relentless toil in sugarcane brakes tended to abbreviate life expectancy. "There are few Negroes who will work unless there be a constant eye on them," Washington advised one overseer, warning of their "idleness and deceit" unless treated firmly. Washington, Chernow notes, wholly approved in 1793 when one of his estate managers, Anthony Whitting, whipped a slave named Charlotte. Martha, the president's wife, had deemed her to be "indolent". "Your treatment of Charlotte was very proper," Washington wrote, "and if she or any other of the servants will not do their duty by fair means, or are impertinent, correction (as the only alternative) must be administered." Washington badgered Whitting to keep another slave named Gunner hard at work to "continue throwing up brick earth". Gunner was 83 years old. With his Mount Vernon plantation creaking under financial pressure owing to his long absences serving the country, Washington would fire off angry letters to his overseers insisting on greater crop productivity. Given these reprimands it is perhaps hardly surprising that another of his estate managers, Hiland Crow, was notorious for brutally flogging slaves. In early 1788 the Potomac river froze over for five weeks, but even with nine inches of snow on the ground, Washington did not spare them from gruelling outdoor labour. He sent the female slaves to dig up tree stumps from a frozen swamp. During this Arctic snap, Washington ventured to ride out and inspect his farms, but noted in his diary that, "finding the cold disagreeable I returned". When some of his slaves absconded during the Revolutionary War to find protection - humiliatingly, for him - with the enemy, Washington did not let up in his efforts to reclaim what he saw as his property. One internal British memo portrayed him after victory as demanding the runaways be returned "with all the grossness and ferocity of a captain of banditti". The British refused. Whenever George and Martha's bondmen and women did flee, the first couple seemed to regard them as disloyal ingrates. In one runaway notice Washington posted in a newspaper, he wrote that a slave named Caesar had escaped "without any cause whatever". That these enslaved human beings might thirst for freedom, or even the opportunity to learn to read and write, did not seem to occur to him. Professor Joseph Ellis, author of American Sphinx: The Character of Thomas Jefferson, says of the founding fathers: "They could imagine a nation-sized republic, which nobody else had ever done before. "They could imagine the separation of church and state, which nobody else had ever done before. "They could imagine a government based on checks and balances that prohibit any form of dictatorship at the presidential level. Nobody had ever done that before. "They could imagine power flowing from the people upwards, rather than from God downward. "All those unbelievable acts of imagination. The most creative political group in American history. We'll never replicate that. "But they could not imagine a biracial society." Jefferson, as every American schoolchild knows, is the nation's third president, and a genius political theoretician who penned arguably the five most important words in modern history - "all men are created equal" - in the 1776 Declaration of Independence. He also owned up to 140 slaves. A bon vivant who lived in luxury at a palatial Virginia estate, Jefferson knew America's original sin was a "depravity", as he described it. But his statements about black people are rarely taught in classrooms today. Here are some Jefferson quotes that visitors will not find on his memorial, a Roman pantheon-style temple to liberty where the Sage of Monticello's graven image keeps vigil over the Tidal Basin in Washington DC. To his friend, French social reformer the Duc de La Rochefoucauld-Liancourt, Jefferson confided that he envisaged eventual manumission to entail "exporting to a distance the whole black race". The duke wrote: "He [Jefferson] bases his opinion on the certain dangerâ€¦ of seeing blood mixed without means of preventing it". And yet Jefferson, historians say, fathered up to six children by one of his mixed-race slaves, Sally Hemings. In his book Notes on the State of Virginia, he prophesied a race war in America and "convulsions which will probably never end but on the extermination of the one or the other race". Jefferson also opined in this work that black people's "unfortunate difference of color" made them less beautiful than whites. "They are more ardent after their female," he continued, "but love seems with them to be more an eager desire, than a tender delicate mixture of sentiment and sensation. "Their griefs are transientâ€¦ in reason much inferior." And so on. Professor Ellis believes a plaque should be put up at the Jefferson Memorial to correct the record and admit some of the Declaration author's less savoury statements. "Jefferson embodies the inherent contradictions, a kind of self-deception, that co-exists in us, too," the biographer said. "Given the relationship with Hemings, the fact that he refused to take a leadership position on ending slavery because of his fear of miscegenation, it makes his hypocrisy even more dramatic. "He's got slaves who are his children serving him at dinner. But he doesn't seem to find that troubling. It's mind-boggling." "Racism is a chromosome in the DNA of the United States," Professor Ellis added. "It's like cancer. It ain't never gonna be cured." Should Americans therefore disavow these founding fathers as scoundrels and national embarrassments, or accept them as men of their time, demigods with feet of clay, who bore their imperfections even as they sought to steer their country beyond them? What actually is the difference between monuments to the founding fathers and Confederate leaders? Dr Clarence Jones - the African-American speechwriter who helped civil rights legend Dr Martin Luther King Jr craft his 1963 "I Have a Dream" address, four words that shaped modern America - explains. He says: "Sure, George Washington and Thomas Jefferson owned slaves. "There was no question they were morally compromised in their effort to fashion together this new country, a republic, based on the principles and precepts enshrined in the Declaration of Independence. "But neither of those two persons led the nation in treasonous insurrection to overthrow the government they had formed in order to preserve the institution of slavery. Period. "On the contrary, they devoted their life to saving and founding this country." He says that commemorating the valour of the Confederacy is just as wrong as celebrating the soldiers of the Third Reich. "What Charlottesville tells us is, it's no longer possible for the United States to ignore this unresolved issue of reconciliation over slavery," said Dr Jones. "Trump missed an extraordinary opportunity - and he still has it - of exercising the leadership of reconciler and healer-in-chief for the nation today." Washington and Jefferson are not the only American historical titans who can seem diminished when viewed through the lens of present-day values. Take Abraham Lincoln, the Great Emancipator and Civil War leader who destroyed the South's slavocracy. He is immortalised in another neo-classical shrine on the National Mall. But as Hofstra University history professor Alan Singer points out, the nation's 16th president espoused racist opinions as his political soul evolved. He is quoted as saying to applause at a debate at Charleston, Illinois, during an 1858 Senate election campaign: "There is a physical difference between the white and black races which I believe will forever forbid the two races living together on terms of social and political equality." The Republican leader is also recorded as having tried to persuade a black delegation in 1862 that African-Americans should self-deport and colonise somewhere like Central America, arguing that it would be "extremely selfish" if they refused. "The United States needs to have a general evaluation of who we are as a nation, so we can come to terms with our present by understanding our past," says Professor Singer. "Nations need heroes to define who we are, to help us see ourselves in a better light. "And the United States has heroes. But we tend not to see the warts. "We tend to try to erase the parts we don't want to see. And this is a time when we have to look." Sometimes, though, it can be hard to look. President Lyndon Baines Johnson is lionised as the signer of the 1964 Civil Rights Act - one of the greatest legislative accomplishments of any US administration - which outlawed discrimination. However, LBJ is also known to have frequently tossed racial slurs around the cloakrooms of the US Senate, according to his biographer Robert Caro. Johnson nicknamed an earlier iteration of the landmark act for which he is known as "the n***** bill". In his memoir, Capitol Hill in Black and White, African-American chauffeur Robert Parker relates a disturbing interaction while he was driving for the Texan. Johnson, he recalls, asked him whether he objected to being called "n*****". When Parker replied that he would rather be addressed by his own name, Johnson allegedly retorted: "As long as you are black, and you're gonna be black till the day you die, no one's gonna call you by your goddamn name. "So no matter what you are called, n*****, you just let it roll off your back like water, and you'll make it. Just pretend you're a goddamn piece of furniture." But Dr Jones believes that LBJ, for all his flaws, understood that his duty as chief magistrate of the United States was to lead his country towards sunlit uplands of a more perfect union, to achieve the unfulfilled promise of its founding. The University of San Francisco professor is in little doubt what his old friend, Dr Martin Luther King Jr, would say to the current White House incumbent. "I have no question," says Dr Jones, "that the pre-eminent apostle of love and non-violence in the 20th Century would remind President Trump he has a responsibility to indicate to the nation what is right and what is wrong. "This is not a time to engage in moral relativity. "I really believe that President Trump is not beyond redemption, that he still has an opportunity to rise to the majesty of the office."	President Donald Trump's argument that the removal of Confederate statues is a slippery slope to changing history has recharged the perennial debate about America's tormented racial legacy.
It is hoped the RNLI camera will reduce the number of launches at Porthcawl, in Bridgend county, which had the second highest number for Wales in 2015. The camera looks out towards the town's pier from the lifeboat station. The location is also notorious for crashing waves that can risk sweeping people out to sea. Ian Stroud from Porthcawl RNLI is their former deputy launch authoriser. He said: "One of the most significant tasks a lifeboat station must undertake is observing sea conditions to make judgements on the equipment lifeboat operators will need. "We wanted a view of the pier as it is such an important landmark. This is viewable by members of the public, who can alert the lifeboat station if they see someone in distress." The camera was supplied by Swansea-based PC-1 and Axis Communications. PC-1's online project manager Graham Thomas said: "We installed a weather station and connected the installation to YouTube, allowing the public and lifeboat staff to view real-time images and accurate weather reports - including tide times. "The station will soon receive a superfast fibre connection, allowing for a further upgrade of the system to take full advantage of the camera's HD capabilities. "We can then look at running an additional camera; one looking at the pier and another focusing on the coastal defence where waves crash up to 300 feet in the air."	One of Wales' busiest lifeboat callout hotspots has had a monitoring camera installed to warn the public of dangerous sea conditions.
Media playback is not supported on this device Wales lost their EuroHockey Championship II final to Scotland, but both teams have reached the A Division. Clements says doing so has been a "challenge" on a limited budget, but feels it will bring benefits. "I'm over the moon for the players and staff. It's a huge achievement," Clements told BBC Wales Sport. "It puts us on a different level and exposes us to a different level of competition that will hopefully drive performances up." The Wales women's side narrowly missed promotion to the top tier, following their 2-1 defeat by Russia in Friday's EuroHockey Championship semi-final. But Clements was pleased with their performances and with the number of fans who came to watch the Cardiff tournament. Media playback is not supported on this device "I'm a big believer in the inspiration our athletes and staff provide as role models," he said. "The buzz around the venue here in Cardiff has been huge and so is the reception the guys have had. "Everyone's buzzing about the sport at the moment and I really feel that'll transcend into people picking up a stick for the first time." The Wales men will join the likes of Germany, England and the Netherlands in the EuroHockey A Division in 2019. But before that both the men and women's teams hope to qualify for the 2018 Commonwealth Games. Clements says he hopes competing at these big tournaments will help earn more Welsh players call-ups for Great Britain. "We really want to push the boundaries and not have a glass ceiling to where we want to get to," he said. "The better we perform as a group, the more chance we've got of players progressing into the GB squads. "Ultimately if we can develop some Olympians that would be utopia."	Hockey Wales head of performance Dan Clements believes the men's promotion to Europe's top tier will help transform the sport in Wales.
The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration closed its investigation after it found no evidence of a defect in the vehicle. Joshua Brown was killed when his car collided with a lorry while operating in Autopilot mode. Tesla has stated Autopilot is only designed to assist drivers, who must keep their hands on the wheel. The feature is intended to be used on the motorway, where it lets cars automatically change lanes and react to traffic. The NHTSA report said data from the car showed that "the driver took no braking, steering or other actions to avoid the collision". Bryan Thomas from the NHSTA said the driver should have been able to see the lorry for seven seconds, which "should have been enough time to take some action". The investigation did not find any evidence that the car's systems "did not perform as designed". However, Mr Thomas said there was "industry-wide" concern about the way driver-assistance features were explained and advertised to customers. "These systems require continual and full attention of the driver," he said. "It's not enough to put [information] in the owner's manual and hope drivers are going to read that. "Manufacturers must anticipate how drivers would use the functionality, and that some don't read the manual." He said systems should be designed with the "inattentive driver" in mind. The NHTSA said it would continue to monitor the safety of Autopilot and would take further action if necessary. Mr Thomas warned manufacturers that if safety defects were found in semi-autonomous cars, they would have to be recalled, even if the vehicles were capable of receiving over-the-air software updates. Following the closure of the investigation, Tesla's chief executive Elon Musk tweeted that the report was "very positive".	Tesla will not be ordered to recall its semi-autonomous cars in the US, following a fatal crash in May 2016.
Moreno, 24, is also wanted by former club Sevilla in La Liga, while Serie A giants AC Milan and Inter Milan have expressed an interest in the left-back. Liverpool will insist on £30m for France defender Mamadou Sakho, who had a spell at Crystal Palace last term. And winger Lazar Markovic is a target for Watford and Zenit St Petersburg. Moreno was displaced at left-back by James Milner last season but Reds manager Jurgen Klopp is in no hurry to sell the player, although Moreno may also want more first-team football at this stage of his career. The Anfield club are confident they will get their full asking price for Sakho, 27, given the current market for centre-backs and the player's successful loan spell at Premier League rivals Palace last season. Serbia winger Markovic is another player unlikely to be in Klopp's plans, especially following the addition of £34m forward Mohamed Salah from Roma. New Watford manager Marco Silva may make a move for the 23-year-old, who joined Liverpool from Benfica in a £20m deal three years ago, after being impressed with Markovic during a loan spell at Hull City last season. Russian side Zenit have also shown an interest in Markovic, who has had loan spells at Fenerbahce and Sporting Lisbon.	Liverpool have rejected an £11m bid from Italian side Napoli for Alberto Moreno - and will demand £15m for the Spanish defender.
Spanish police say he had secretly taken photographs of his students as well as having sent images of other children to people on the internet. The Manchester-born man reportedly had a "special obsession" with a girl he taught. He was arrested in Valladolid, north-west Spain as part of an Interpol investigation. Interpol said they discovered illegal files were being sent from an email address in Spain and alerted the authorities. Police said on Sunday the teacher is suspected of using a cloud storage service to keep and share the pictures between computers and with others. Officers say they found a large number of sexually explicit files involving minors at the home of the teacher. He kept photos of one girl in a dedicated folder on his computer but had not shared the images he had secretly taken of his underage students. Police said they believe he previously lived in the Seville area. Spanish National Police said: "At the moment, [police are] trying to establish the identity of the victims shown in the images found on the electronic devices belonging to the detained."	A British teacher living in Spain has been arrested for allegedly storing and sharing sexual images of children.
Mother-of-two Tracy Kearns, 43, of Kinmel Bay, has not been seen since about 20:00 BST on 7 May. On Thursday, a 48-year-old man, who police said was known to Ms Kearns, was arrested on suspicion of murder in connection with her disappearance. Police said specialist searches were focused on land alongside Tir Prince leisure park and extensive searches were ongoing in Kinmel Bay and Towyn. Ms Kearns is described as 5ft 3ins (1.6m) tall with sandy coloured shoulder-length hair. Supt Sian Beck, from North Wales Police, said: "We are still trying to find Tracy. "Officers are carrying out house to house inquiries, speaking to local people who may have information."	Specialist teams have joined the search for a woman missing in Conwy county.
Kyle Clarke, 27, died when he was hit by a car in Hengrove, Bristol in January and was dragged along under the vehicle for 600m. His mother Helen Stockford described him as the "light of her life". In 2009, Kyle saved her from a convicted murderer and rapist who was on parole from prison. Kyle interrupted Kenneth Shirley who had broken into the family home, raped his mother and planned to kill her. Shirley, known by his middle name of Mark, had been released from prison on licence after serving 16 years of a life sentence for the ritualistic murder of a pensioner. Mrs Stockford said her son had been badly affected by the incident and developed an eating disorder. Following Shirley's conviction, which saw Mrs Stockford waive her anonymity to campaign for longer prison terms, Kyle had looked after her. She said: "Over the dark seven years it's always been 'you alright today Mum? Is there anywhere we need to take you today Mum? Do you need me to do anything? "What I miss most is, wherever he was, he would say 'night night mum', and I'm still waiting and that's crippled me. "He was just so funny. There's so much you can say about him. He was the light of my life really. He was just so lovely, always joking, smiling, laughing." Shakrun Islam, 30, from Chipping Sodbury is charged with Kyle's manslaughter. He is to appear before Bristol Crown Court on Friday.	A woman whose son saved her from being killed by an intruder paid tribute to him as his funeral took place.
Glamorgan were beaten in under two-and-a-half days against Worcestershire having failed to last two days in their opening loss at Northamptonshire. Rudolph says discussions have been held with the senior players and head coach Robert Croft. "We've had some good, strong conversations," Rudolph said. "I think it's important for the senior players in the team to stand up. "We have a good blend of senior players and a lot of young Welsh talent in the likes of Aneurin Donald and Kiran Carlson. "We've refocused and we're ready for Friday's game against Leicestershire and it will be nice to start off with a win. "I've always been of the belief that in County Cricket as soon as you can gather some momentum you've got to try and carry it on for a long time." Glamorgan were beaten by an innings and 22 runs by Northants in their opening game of the season before an eight-wicket loss at home to Worcestershire. Despite his side's poor start to the season, South African Rudolph still believes Glamorgan can make an impression in Division Two of the County Championship. "If you look at last season we started with three losses and during the season there were about three or four games where we just missed out on winning opportunities," Rudolph told BBC Radio Wales Sport. "If that had happened we would still have finished in the top three or four so it's not all doom and gloom at the moment."	Captain Jacques Rudolph has said Glamorgan's senior players need to "stand up" after the county's poor start to the Championship season.
PC Ed Barker, of Greater Manchester Police (GMP), stopped the man falling 40ft (12m) from Rochdale Town Hall. Seeing the man in distress, PC Barker ran up the building's fire escape steps before catching him just as he tried to throw himself to the ground. PC Barker has been awarded the force's John Egerton Trophy. Chief Constable Ian Hopkins presented the trophy, which is awarded annually to a GMP officer who has performed an exceptional act of valour. The award is named after PC John Egerton, who was killed in the line of duty on 11 March 1982, aged 20. PC Barker is also due to meet Prime Minister David Cameron during the Police Bravery Awards on 14 July. Mr Hopkins said his officer showed "incredible bravery" during the incident, which happened in January 2015. "There was a genuine risk of him being carried over the edge of the snow-covered fire escape, which could have had tragic consequences for both men," he said. "His cool head and quick thinking saved this young man from certain death and I am delighted that he is now safe and well." PC Barker said the 21-year-old man's friends had tried to help him but were "losing their strength" when he arrived. "I managed to get hold of him around the neck and shoulders because the rest of his body was hanging off the edge of the fire escape," he said. "I was so relieved when I saw the blue lights arriving to help take him to hospital. "It's nice to get some recognition and appreciation, but I was helped by his friends and my colleagues."	A police officer who saved the life of a suicidal man by grabbing him by the neck as he tried to jump from a snow-covered roof has won a bravery award.
The incident occurred on Great Northern Road near to its junction with Clifton Road at about 12:00 on Saturday. Police Scotland has appealed for witnesses to the crash. Police said the collision involved a black Yamaha motorcycle, a black Vauxhall Adam and a silver Volkswagen Caravelle. Sgt Malcolm Kinross, of Police Scotland's divisional road policing unit, said: "Our thoughts at this difficult time are with the family and friends of Damian Piotrowski. "We continue to investigate the circumstances of this collision and we are appealing for anyone who was in the area at the time to come forward. "In particular, we are keen to speak to passing motorists in a white Vauxhall Insignia and a dark coloured Nissan Qashqai who may have witnessed the collision."	A 27-year-old motorcyclist who died following a three-vehicle crash in Aberdeen has been named by police as Damian Piotrowski.
Media playback is not supported on this device The Leinster back-rower has been out for a number of weeks with a calf injury but has taken a full part in training since Tuesday. Iain Henderson starts in the second row as Donnacha Ryan has been struggling this week with a knee injury. Ian Keatley is named as fly-half Paddy Jackson's understudy on the bench, which also includes winger Tommy Bowe. Media playback is not supported on this device Ryan has been suffering from a niggling medial ligament injury and has not trained since Tuesday. "We wanted a bit more certainty about him but at the same time Iain has done a super job for us in the past," explained Ireland coach Joe Schmidt at the team announcement. Keith Earls and Simon Zebo start on the wings. Regular number 10 Johnny Sexton was ruled out of the Murrayfield match earlier this week as the calf injury he picked up in Leinster's Champions Cup game against Castres on 20 January has not yet fully healed. The 31-year-old has an "outside chance" of being fit to face Italy in Rome on 11 February, according to Schmidt. Sexton's unavailability leaves Ulster's Jackson to make his sixth start in eight games for Ireland, his last coming in the victory over Australia in Ireland's final autumn international in November. Munster flanker Peter O'Mahony is out with a hamstring problem so open-side O'Brien joins blind-side flanker CJ Stander and number eight Jamie Heaslip in the back row. Andrew Trimble's absence with a groin injury left Earls and Zebo as obvious choices to join full-back Rob Kearney in the back three, with Bowe getting the nod among the replacements ahead of Craig Gilroy or Tiernan O'Halloran. Garry Ringrose and Robbie Henshaw form the midfield pairing, with Conor Murray joining Jackson to make up the half-back partnership. Up front, the front row combination of Jack McGrath, Rory Best and Tadhg Furlong is retained, while Devin Toner joins Henderson at lock. Uncapped hooker Niall Scannell and his Munster front-row partner John Ryan are listed as replacements in preference to James Tracy and Finlay Bealham. BBC Scotland's Tom English Ireland's team is formidable, despite Johnny Sexton not being in it. It's an illustration of their depth that Donnacha Ryan, a standout in the second-row in the victory over New Zealand, can't now get into the 23. Jared Payne and Jordi Murphy, two more heroes from that historic victory, are long-term injuries, but Ireland are still loaded with class, power and experience. Ireland: R Kearney; K Earls, G Ringrose, R Henshaw, S Zebo; P Jackson, C Murray; J McGrath, R Best, T Furlong; I Henderson, D Toner; CJ Stander, S O'Brien, J Heaslip. Replacements: N Scannell, C Healy, U Dillane, J Ryan, J van der Flier, K Marmion, I Keatley, T Bowe.	Flanker Sean O'Brien has been named in the Ireland team to face Scotland in Saturday's Six Nations opener.
Adam Mitchell is believed to have been in a pub in Inverness' Baron Taylor Street on Wednesday night last week. Police Scotland said CCTV images show him near the Harry Fairbairn BMW garage on Longman Road at 00:52 on Thursday. Coastguard and police helicopters and the RNLI's Kessock lifeboat were involved in making searches of Inverness Harbour and Beauly Firth. The effort followed up on searches made earlier last week. Family and friends said Mr Mitchell's failure to return to his home in the Culduthel area was out of character. Mr Mitchell is described as 5ft 11in in height, stocky build with long mousy brown hair and a beard. When last seen he was wearing a black leather jacket, a denim vest, black jeans and boots.	Air, sea and land searches were made over the weekend for a missing 18-year-old Inverness man.
The price fell below 4.8 euros in early trading, before recovering to above 5 euros by late afternoon. Carbon permits are a mechanism designed to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, as companies have to pay to emit C02. A sharp drop in demand for energy has led to a massive oversupply of permits. Critics of  the EU's Emissions Trading System also argue that the European Union issued too many permits in the first place. The EU has proposed freezing up to 900 million permits to tackle this oversupply. "There are too many permits because of the recession," said Isaac Valero, spokesman for EU Climate Commissioner Connie Hedegaard. The price of carbon recovered slightly on Monday after demand for an auction of 3.5 million permits was stronger than expected. A weak carbon price undermines efforts to reduce C02 emissions. The price of carbon needs to be a good deal higher than 5 euros - some believe between 25 and 30 euros - to provide an adequate incentive for companies to cut emissions and invest in cleaner technologies, experts say. The carbon market is central to Europe's efforts to meet its climate change target of a 20% reduction in C02 emissions from 1990 levels by 2020.	The price of carbon hit a record low in Europe on Monday as the over-supply of emissions permits during the global economic downturn continued to undermine the carbon market.
Heard, 30, filed for divorce in Los Angeles Superior Court citing irreconcilable differences. They married 15 months ago and have no children. They have recently been embroiled in a legal case in Australia after Heard took two dogs into the country illegally. She pleaded guilty in April to a charge of falsifying documents. Depp, 52, and Heard met while co-starring in the 2011 film The Rum Diary. In the court papers, Texan-born Heard listed the separation date as Sunday. Celebrity news website TMZ reported that Depp had asked a judge to reject Heard's claim for spousal support. The split comes days after the death of Depp's mother. His latest film, Alice Through the Looking Glass, is due to be released on Friday. The Australian court case started last year when Heard brought two dogs into the country where her husband was filming the latest movie in the Pirates of the Caribbean series. When the case was settled, the couple released a video apology expressing remorse and advising travellers to respect Australian quarantine laws. However, Australia's Deputy PM Barnaby Joyce had threatened to have the dogs put down, triggering a war of words with Depp that lasted for months. The actor recently said on a US TV show that Mr Joyce looks "somehow inbred with a tomato". Mr Joyce responded by saying he was "pulling strings" in Johnny Depp's head, like film villain Hannibal Lecter.	Film star Johnny Depp and his actress wife Amber Heard are to divorce, US court documents have revealed.
Jenny Rathbone said some tenants were charged ??150 to have properties taken off the market while a contract was finalised, while others charged ??65 for cleaning the property. The Cardiff Central AM called for a ban on the charging of such fees. Ministers have warned of a risk that banning fees would push up rents. In Scotland, all charges to private tenants other than rent and deposits have been deemed illegal since 2012. Campaigners have called for similar rules in other parts of the UK. In a Senedd debate, Ms Rathbone said: "It should be the landlord paying the letting agency, not the tenant." She added: "Frankly, the letting agencies are getting away with simply not providing a service in exchange for the fee and I think it's something that needs to be stopped as a matter of urgency." Assembly lawyers have told Ms Rathbone that Wales had the legal powers to impose a ban, despite the Welsh Government previously saying it did not have the authority. Communities Secretary Carl Sargeant said agents were legally obliged to advertise fees, and he was "not persuaded" a ban was needed at this time. "I wouldn't want to see the fees - extortionate fees in some cases - just being transferred to the tenant [in the form of higher rents]," he said. "I would like to learn from the evidence from the experience in Scotland before deciding whether this measure is necessary," Mr Sargeant added. Sunday Politics Wales is on BBC One Wales on Sunday 16 October at 1100 BST	Students and other people renting their homes have been victims of "widespread abuse" of fees charged by letting agents, a Labour AM has claimed.
Media playback is not supported on this device West Ham manager Slaven Bilic questioned Dean's decision to send off Sofiane Feghouli in his side's 2-0 defeat by Manchester United on Monday. It was the fifth red card Dean has shown in 15 matches this season. The Hammers are appealing against Feghouli's dismissal. Dean sent off the Algeria international midfielder after just 15 minutes following his collision with Phil Jones, but Bilic felt the United defender had committed the more dangerous tackle. The dismissal was the 25th by Dean since the start of the 2013-14 season - the highest number by any current Premier League referee in that period. Writing in The Times, former player Tony Cascarino said Dean "lost all control of the game" while Sky Sports pundit Niall Quinn called Dean "arrogant" and the decision "rank bad refereeing". But former Manchester United captain Gary Neville later tweeted: "I was critical of Mike Dean's performance in the game. He was poor. But I think the reaction since towards him is disgraceful. "Yes, he should be criticised but to suggest he wanted to be centre of attention and he should be sacked or not referee again is wrong!" Sunday's FA Cup match between Tottenham and Aston Villa is live on BBC One from 15:35 GMT, and full match commentary will be available on BBC Radio 5 live from 16:00 GMT.	Mike Dean will referee Sunday's televised FA Cup third-round tie between Tottenham and Aston Villa - despite recent criticism of his performances.
Border Force officers found 19 Albanians and one Syrian hidden in a trailer carrying machinery at North Shields ferry terminal in 2015. The HGV driver, Marek Niedzwiecki, 33, was jailed for five years at Newcastle Crown Court. Accomplices Ferdinand Gjolla and Armando Mekolli were jailed for eight and three years respectively. All three were found guilty of conspiring to facilitate unlawful entry into the UK following a 13-day trial. The Home Office said officers inspected Polish national Niedzwiecki's lorry when it arrived from Ijmuiden, Holland, on 1 September 2015. Their investigation led them to the home in Redhill Avenue, Barnsley, of Albanian national Gjolla, 41. The Home Office said Gjolla was the main organiser while Niedzwiecki, an HGV driver, was responsible for transporting the people into the UK, and Mekolli, 30, assisted Gjolla with the transportation of them once they arrived in the UK. Rachael Luther, from the Immigration Enforcement Criminal Investigations team, said: "This was a well-run organised crime group motivated by money. "Their sole aim was to breach the UK's immigration controls and bring people into the UK illegally." Of the 20 people found in the back of the lorry, 16 have been returned to Albania. The Home Office said the cases of the remaining four are being progressed in line with the immigration rules.	Three men who tried to smuggle 20 people into the UK in a lorry have been jailed.

But she was overhauled by Cheruiyot, 32, and her Kenyan compatriot Hellen Onsando Obiri, 26, who took silver. Cheruiyot set an Olympic record time of 14 minutes 26.17 seconds. Britain's Eilish McColgan was 13th in 15:12.09. "It's my fourth Olympics and I hadn't had gold. Today I said 'I am not going to lose'," said Cheruiyot, who was runner-up to Almaz in the 10,000m in Rio and the London 2012 5,000m silver medallist. McColgan said: "Yes, I'm actually disappointed although it's good that I am disappointed. At the start of the year if someone had said that, I would have taken it. "Looking at the other girls' personal bests I thought that I should be around the top eight and to come 13th, I'm really disappointed. I'm in better shape than that.

An IFA Disciplinary Committee opted not to impose any sanction after finding that Carrick did not properly implement manager Gary Haveron's touchline ban. The committee said it would "exercise its discretion" in the matter. A Warrenpoint Town statement argued that the decision "contradicted the IFA's obligation to apply objectivity". "The board of Warrenpoint Town have read the IFA Disciplinary Committee determination regarding the breach of Article 23.1 of the IFA Disciplinary Code by the Carrick Rangers FC Manager," the statement began. "We are shocked that the IFA having found Carrick guilty failed to implement the requisite admonishment as per established rules. "The board will be meeting soon to discuss further this matter and the complaint we formally raised surrounding eligibility which is in abeyance." Carrick faced a possible three-point deduction and relegation from the top flight, plus a possible fine of at least £350, if the outcome of the hearing did not go in their favour. However in a statement released on Wednesday night, the committee indicated that "the interests of justice were best served by not imposing a sanction in all the circumstances". As it stands, Ballinamallard United and Institute await a date for the second leg of their promotion-relegation play-off, the Mallards having won the first leg 2-1 at the Riverside Stadium on 6 May. Haveron sat out a three-game ban handed out by the IFA, but was in the dugout for his club's match against Dungannon Swifts on 23 April when he should not have been. "The club did not explain to the Committee's satisfaction the reasons why the start date for the suspension set out in the initial charge letter (18 April 2016)  was not complied with and therefore the challenge from Carrick Rangers was not upheld," read the IFA statement released on Wednesday night. "The Committee took into account the points made on behalf of the club and decided to exercise its discretion under the overriding objective as outlined in Articles 1.6 and 1.7 of the Disciplinary Code and found that no sanction should be applied." "In applying its discretion it took into account, what it found to be the honest intention of the club to serve a suspension, the fact that three matches had been served and points made regarding possible confusion in the way in which the suspension was to be implemented."	Warrenpoint Town say they are "shocked" by an IFA ruling that confirmed their relegation from the Premiership and saw Carrick Rangers stay in the top flight.
Media playback is not supported on this device A report into claims of bullying said British Cycling "lacked good governance" at board level. Cookson, who led the organisation for 17 years before becoming UCI president, said: "If there was a lacking, I think we all share in that responsibility." He added British Cycling had been scrutinised by UK Sport. Asked if he was "pinning the blame" on the funding agency, he said: "As I understand it, they were closely involved in how things were managed and monitored. "I'm not trying to dodge any of my responsibility. What I'm saying is there were other people with responsibilities as well." The Phelps report into the culture of Britain's cycling team criticised former technical director Shane Sutton and UK Sport, and noted a "culture of fear" existed within the team, according to many staff members. "I don't accept there was a culture of fear and I spent a lot of time at the National Cycling Centre," said Cookson, who is seeking re-election after joining the UCI in 2013. However, he said Sutton should have been moved following recommendations from the King Review in 2012. "One of the recommendations was that Shane be moved out of direct coaching with athletes," he said. "As far as I understood in the first half of 2013, that was one of those action-plan elements that was implemented and it was after that in the middle of 2013 I became a candidate and then was elected to the UCI presidency." Australian Sutton stayed on before resigning last year amid claims of sexism and was later found to have used sexist language towards cyclist Jess Varnish, though he was cleared of eight of the nine charges against him. Media playback is not supported on this device Cookson defended his record at British Cycling, saying: "I'm not making any excuses for my behaviour. I think we made incredible progress and some great achievements. "The idea we had no respect for athlete welfare is wrong. The relationship between athletes and coaches was something we were concerned about from time to time. Action was taken." And he disagrees with MP Damian Collins, who has called for board members from the period covered in the investigation to resign. "My former colleagues at British Cycling have been committed to their sport over many years. Many of them are good people who have worked very hard," Cookson said. UK Anti-Doping is also investigating allegations of wrongdoing against Team Sky and British Cycling, which both deny. "The reputational problems that have been around that team in the past few months have not been helpful. I want to wait for the outcome of UK Anti-Doping's enquiries," he said. Cookson said cycling had made significant progress in the battle against cheating during his tenure at the UCI. "We were previously considered pariahs in the anti-doping world. Now we have one of he best reputations in sport, I believe," he added. BBC Radio 5 live sports news correspondent Richard Conway Brian Cookson wants to be re-elected later this year for a second term as president of cycling's world governing body, and sees a fresh mandate as his future. However, his past is catching up with him. After a 17-year period as the president of British Cycling many believe it's under his tenure that the rot set in within the organisation, a fact addressed and criticised in the recent Phelps review. Cookson doesn't shirk responsibility for some of the major welfare issues that have occurred within British Cycling. But what is striking is that he refuses to accept wholesale blame. In my interview with him, he points the finger firmly at UK Sport, saying one of their officials was embedded within the world-class cycling programme at the Manchester velodrome and was involved in management and monitoring. Any "lacking" must be shared, he believes. His message is, in effect: 'Why should the blame fall only on my shoulders?' Shane Sutton, according to the 2012 King report, should have been moved away from direct coaching with athletes. We now know he referred to disabled cyclists as "gimps and wobblies" in addition to his role in Jess Varnish's departure from the British team. But Cookson points to the fact he moved in 2013 to be president of the UCI and, in his absence, Sutton carried on working with cyclists unimpeded and with serious consequences. Again, Cookson's overarching message is clear: nothing to do with me, guv.	Brian Cookson, the head of cycling's world governing body, says blame for British Cycling's failings should not rest solely with him.
Edward Alexander Lee, 34, was sentenced to three years on probation at Belfast Crown Court on Wednesday. Judge Gordon Kerr QC said it was the best way of protecting society and helping Lee to change his ways. Lee, originally from Whitehall Square, Belfast, but now living in England, pleaded guilty to a total of 15 charges related to child pornography. The court was told the vast majority of the images were in the lowest categories, although some were in the higher - more serious - categories. Lee was described by his wife as a being "loving and normal young man". Judge Kerr said that while he had viewed the images for his "own strange pleasure", they were serious matters as "children were abused for these images to be made". He added that children would continue to be abused while people like Lee continued to view such material, and that "society would not tolerate such behaviour". Judge Kerr said a sentence of up to a year in prison would do very little to assist Lee or the community. Placing him on probation, he ordered him to complete a course on sexual offending to help him stop viewing such images. Earlier, prosecutor Simon Jenkins said that when police went to Lee's then Belfast home on 5 June, 2014, he immediately confirmed he was the man they were looking for. On computer equipment seized, police uncovered a number of folders, which Lee admitted creating. During interview, Lee said that he had been downloading images "for perhaps the last nine years". Defence lawyer Taylor Campbell said that Lee had admitted his guilt from the outset, pleading guilty at arraignment, and was entirely frank and co-operative with police.	A man, who downloaded thousands of images of children being sexually abused, has been released on probation.
George Verrier was treated by officers who were called to an altercation involving about 20 people in Bromley in the early hours of Sunday. He did not want to be taken to hospital, said police, but was found unconscious several hours later in nearby Ferndale. He died in hospital. A 17-year-old arrested on suspicion of murder has been released on bail. The Met said it had voluntarily referred the actions of officers who went to the scene to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) for assessment. A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: "At this early stage it appears the victim suffered a head injury as a result of the altercation. "Inquiries continue to establish the full circumstances of the incident." George, a trainee electrician, was injured in Southborough Road at about 00:45 BST, while on his way home from the party in adjacent Blenheim Road. Police were called at about 09:30 BST to a home in Ferndale - about a mile away - after he fell unconscious. He was taken by air ambulance to hospital where he died at about 18:00 BST. He had been due to have his first driving lesson on Tuesday. Cornelius Moran, whose 16-year-old daughter was having the party, said: "He was a good friend of my daughter's. A lovely boy from what she tells me. "My thoughts are with the family." A woman who lives near the party venue, but did not wish to be named, said: "It looked like a very well-organised party - it was noisy, that's all. "The family who had the party are such a nice family." Another neighbour said some partygoers had been turned away from the house. He said: "We were very much aware of the noise. That stopped at about 12.30am when the music stopped. "My wife was looking out of the window and she could see three large adults leading a group of youngsters up the road, turning them away from the party."	A 17-year-old boy has died of head injuries following a fight after a party in south-east London.
Thousands more had official guest status and got a slightly closer view from inside the spaceport itself. A magnificent morning ascent for the youngest of the Nasa spaceplanes as it began its final mission - the delivery of the $2bn Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS) instrument to the International Space Station. There will, however, be a group of British engineers for whom Monday's lift-off was a bitter-sweet moment. These are the people whose technology got dropped from AMS in the year before launch. For those not familiar with this story, let me back up and reprise events. They have some potentially fascinating implications for deep space travel. AMS is one of the most expensive science experiments ever put in space - probably the most expensive. It has taken a group of 600 or so researchers from 16 nations a total of 17 years to prepare it for flight. It promises some dramatic new insights into the origin and make-up of the cosmos. AMS will do this by studying the storm of high-energy particles (cosmic rays) that are hurled at Earth from the deepest reaches of the Universe. Critical to its operation is a very strong magnet. As the particles enter AMS, they will bend through this magnet. How they bend reveals their charge, a fundamental property that says a great deal about the nature of those particles and where they came from. The UK at a programmatic level never got involved in AMS, presumably because it was a space station project (and the UK doesn't engage with human spaceflight), but one British company was contracted to build the all-important magnet. Scientific Magnetics (formerly Space Cryomagnetics) of Culham, in Oxfordshire, spent 12 years developing this super-cooled beast, and it was - so the project leaders on AMS told me - a marvel. It was incredibly powerful and directed its entire field inwards, like an enclosed bubble. From the outside, the magnet appeared as an inert beer can. This was really important because if you put such a device on a shuttle or a space station and it hasn't been carefully designed, it will start to interact with its surrounding - even try to orientate itself with the Earth's magnetic field. Not what you want on a space vehicle. But to cut a long story short, the British magnet's super-fluid-helium cooling mechanism meant that it was only ever going to be a short-lived device. And when the space station's life was extended last year to 2020, the AMS project leaders took the decision to remove the UK magnet and replace it with a less powerful, but much longer-lived, Chinese one. Now, as I say, this is a story with some interesting outcomes. The British magnet is currently sitting in store at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (Cern) where AMS was assembled and tested, and there's a lot of interest in seeing its technology put to other uses. The first of these is astronaut protection. The cosmic rays that AMS is trying to characterise are particles that also represent a hazard to humans in space. When astronauts eventually go beyond the space station - back to the Moon, and on to asteroids and Mars - they will need to shield themselves from these high-energy particles. The idea of using a powerful magnetic field to do this job is being investigated Dr Roberto Battiston, the deputy principal investigator on AMS. He told me: "We continue to work to understand how this technology could be used for future shielding of astronauts undergoing long exposure, for instance at a Moonbase or on a trip to Marsâ€¦ because this is by far the most advanced super-conducting magnet-design ever built and completed for a space mission. It is not going to fly but it had everything that would allow it to fly. "The European Space Agency asked me to submit a proposal for a feasibility study and [Scientific Magnetics] is part of it. "We would design the magnet in a different way to the AMS one.  AMS was designed to have a very strong magnetic field within an inner bore. By modifying the coils and the currents, we can design a magnetic field confined in an external ring surrounding an inner bore that is magnetic-field free. In this internal module will be the habitable part for the astronauts - where they will live. We are talking about something having a diameter of about five to six metres and the length of 10m - surrounded by this magnetic field that is intense enough to bend away cosmic rays coming from deep space." There are immense practicalities to overcome, of course. These special magnets get their strength because they are superconducting. This means running them at cryo-temperatures, which demands a lot of liquid helium. This has a tendency to boil off over time, limiting the life of your device, which brings us back to AMS. All that said, Professor Battiston is encouraged by the research. He says it should be possible to limit radiation exposure on a Mars flight to something similar to that currently experienced by astronauts on a six-month stay at the space station. The other big space application for which British magnet technology might be useful is in the plasma rockets that could one day propel all spacecraft. These rely on the motion of highly excited gases, or plasmas, moulded by magnetic fields to provide thrust. Although they don't give the initial big kick you get from chemical combustion, their supreme efficiency means they can go on thrusting for extended periods, achieving far more acceleration per kilogram of fuel consumed. Proponents of plasma rockets say they could dramatically cut the journey time to Mars from months to weeks. Scientific Magnetics has already produced a superconducting magnet for a testbed at Ad Astra in Texas, the company at the forefront of this propulsion technology. Steve Harrison from Scientific Magnetics told me: "These rockets use radio frequency heating to generate the plasma and then the magnets contain the plasma in the same way they do in a tokomak fusion reactor. The magnets are profiled such that they form a sort of nozzle out the back; and because the plasma is expanding and supersonic, it flies out and gives you thrust. For the system Ad Astra has been testing for the last two years, we designed and built the super-conducting magnet." Similar obstacles to the magnetic shield prevent immediate adoption of the propulsion application as well, especially if the propulsion magnets incorporate cryogenic liquids, but both concepts are definitely worth watching for the future.	It's thought as many as half a million people crammed the roads and beaches outside the Kennedy Space Center to see Endeavour's final launch.
Mr Blunkett said using the same funding formula applied to Wales - which has a devolved budget - Yorkshire would be entitled to a Â£24bn budget. "You put great store by devolving decision-making to ordinary people," he told Prime Minister David Cameron. Mr Cameron said the government had already got rid of a "centralised" approach that Mr Blunkett was part of. Mr Blunkett, a Labour former Cabinet minister and the MP for Sheffield Brightside and Hillsborough, made the suggestion during prime minister's questions in the House of Commons. He said: "Can you think of one single reason why the people of Yorkshire shouldn't determine their own priorities? "And, mischievously, one reason why the people of Yorkshire shouldn't have their own White Rose Parliament?" Mr Cameron said: "What we are doing is we are saying to councils in Yorkshire, as up and down the country, 'We are getting rid of the ring fences, we are giving you the power to spend your money in the way that you choose'." He added: "We have got rid of the bossy, centralised interfering approach that I'm afraid you were rather part of."	Yorkshire should be given its own "White Rose Parliament" with its own budget, MP David Blunkett has said.
Media playback is unsupported on your device 12 September 2013 Last updated at 22:08 BST In a BBC interview with Juliana Liu at the World Economic Forum's conference in Dalian, China, Mr McGregor, a former journalist who has lived in the country for more than 25 years, said China's behaviour was "very worrisome" for foreign companies. "They don't know what's hitting them right now", he said. The government is resorting to its traditional "toolbox" of coercive methods, he argues, including "shaming and ordering people to confess that they've done wrong so that your penalties can be minimised". At the same time as offering entrepreneurs more opportunities, he argues, the Chinese government is saying: "Don't mess with us". "They're just treating foreign companies the way they've treated their own for many years, and this is the way the Party does things", he says. "These are the tools it knows." "What may be going on is they're telling foreign companies and they're telling private companies here: Behave yourself; remember we're the Party, we're in charge." His comments come against the backdrop of a Chinese police investigation into alleged corruption by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), the British pharmaceutical company accused of using travel agencies to channel up to ??320m of bribes to doctors and officials. GSK has denied any corporate involvement in the alleged wrongdoing, whilst admitting that certain individuals may have behaved inappropriately.	Jim McGregor, Greater China chairman of communications consultancy APCO Worldwide, has given a critical assessment of the way China's government is treating foreign companies as part of its anti-corruption drive.
Taylor, 27, retired with a heart condition in April 2016 after seven England Tests and 27 one-day games. He has since worked with Nottinghamshire and Yorkshire's academies in addition to media work. "It's great to see his desire to still be involved with the game," head coach David Ripley said of Taylor's arrival. "James has a fantastic 50-over record, averaging over 50 which is obviously outstanding. "I believe he can offer good advice and relay his one-day cricket experiences on to our batsmen." Meanwhile, former Northants captain Sales, who scored in excess of 22,000 runs in more than 20 years at the County Ground before his retirement in 2014, will work with the county's batsmen. "David has been working part time with the batters since January, focusing on improving more of the technical aspects of their game," Ripley added. "I believe his cricket brain and experience are a real positive for the squad and will go a long way to improving their overall game."	Former England batsman James Taylor has joined Northamptonshire as a coaching consultant, while David Sales has taken a part-time coaching role.
The pound started to rise just before the first results came in as traders predicted a win for the Remain side - eventually hitting a high of over $1.50. But as reality sank in and the Leave side pulled away the currency went into freefall touching lows of $1.30, levels not seen since 1985. Since then the pound has had some better days but has still lost over 13% of its value against the dollar. The value of a nation's currency is often described as its effective share price - a gauge of how investors see the strength of the economy. "The fall in the pound can be seen as a barometer of sentiment in the markets," says Jeremy Stretch, a currency analyst at CIBC. "If a currency falls traders are effectively saying that it needs to go lower to make it attractive enough for them to make investments." Despite having fallen to lows we have not seen for 30 years, some in the market think the pound could still fall further against the dollar. "When you look at how quickly the pound has fallen in the past, I don't think it is beyond the bounds of possibility that we could see the pound in the low $1.20 range against the dollar," says Simon Derrick, head of currency research at Bank of New York Mellon. So what does history tell us about one of the key drivers of the UK economy? November 2007: sterling reached $2.11 The pound soared from $1.40 in 2002 right up to $2.10 in October 2007. British tourists flocked to the US as the pound strengthened, often coming backed weighed down with suitcases full of clothes and gadgets. "It was in some respects the golden days for the UK with a booming financial sector and the sense of 'Cool Britannia' in the country," says Prof Albrecht Ritschl an economic historian at the London School of Economics. The pound strengthened as the UK economy boomed, inflation stayed relatively low and interest rates offered a decent return for investors. "It was a very settled economic environment with few political upheavals, completely different from the post-Brexit world we see today," says Howard Archer, an economist at IHS Global Insight. Those heady days of economic boom were replaced with the financial crisis of 2008 which saw the pound collapse as the UK economy fell into recession. The pound fell 35% to lows of about $1.40 in early 2009, before picking up as the UK slowly emerged from the downturn. February 1985: Sterling reached $1.05 Back in February 1985, the pound slid to $1.05. But unlike today it was less a story of pound weakness and more to do with a very strong dollar. The combination of Ronald Reagan as US president and the tenure of Paul Volcker as chairman of the Federal Reserve saw the dollar appreciate 26% between 1980 and 1984. President Reagan instituted a series of tax cuts and spending rises in an attempt to revive the economy. This in turn pushed up long-term interest rates, attracting inflows of capital and pushing up the value of the dollar. Despite the pressure of the strong dollar, the UK economy was performing well at the time with economic growth of 2.3% in 1984 and 4.2% in 1985. The strength of the dollar created international tension which was addressed in an unprecedented meeting of world leaders and central bankers at the Plaza Hotel in New York in September 1985. The central bankers agreed that other currencies should appreciate against the dollar and followed their words with interventions in foreign exchange markets, selling dollars in exchange for other currencies. The actions of those involved in the so-called "Plaza Accord" contributed to the dollar falling 40% between 1985 and 1987. The pound gained ground on the dollar in the months that followed, hitting $1.88 in December 1987.	As the nation anxiously waited for the EU referendum results last month, currency traders were busy making bets on which way the vote would go.
Fifty lodges from around Ireland, along with visiting Orangemen and women, attended the event. The parade, accompanied by 30 bands, made its way along the rural coastal setting into the centre of the seaside village before a religious service. Many families with young children gathered at vantage points along the route to take in the demonstration. County grandmaster David Mahon said Donegal prides itself on being a family-friendly day with a relaxed atmosphere. The parade is the traditional opener to the annual 12 July celebrations marking King William III's victory at the Battle of the Boyne in 1690. Assistant Grand Master Stuart Brooker told the crowds the institution was "being challenged on many fronts". "One of the biggest issues we currently face is organised opposition to our traditional parades, and in this respect, we are branded intransigent, and insensitive," he said. "We have responded by challenging ourselves. And I believe that we have responded in a responsible manner, by reaching out to the wider community as never before." He added that they have done so "in a spirit of openness and goodwill, evidenced in the success of the Twelfth here in Rossnowlagh."	Thousands of Orangemen and women have taken part in their annual parade in Rossnowlagh in County Donegal.
Of these 216 planets, 10 of them could potentially be home to some sort of life, because they are 'Earth-like'. This means they have 'rocky' characteristics, and they are located in the 'Goldilocks Zone' of their solar system. If a planet is in a 'Goldilocks Zone' it is not too hot or too cold, which means water can be in its liquid form there. The Kepler Telescope has made some amazing discoveries since it was launched in 2009, but here are the top five findings... In 2014 the telescope made a huge discovery by finding a planet nicknamed: 'Earth 2.0'. The planet called, Kepler-452b has been dubbed as 'Earth 2.0', because it shares many characteristics with our Earth, even though it is 1,400 light years away from us. The first potentially habitable planet the telescope found was Kepler-22b, way back in 2011. Scientists agreed the planet was could be liveable because it was the perfect distance from its sun. In April 2017 the telescope found a super-Earth. This is a planet called LHS 1140b. It is a good candidate for life and orbits a red dwarf star 40 light years away. However, scientists think the planet might have had an ocean made entirely out of magma! - which released steam into the atmosphere. In February 2017, Kepler discovered seven new Earth-sized exoplanets. Exoplanets are planets that orbit a different star to our Sun - in a different solar system to the one we are in. In 2011 Nasa discovered the first planet to orbit two suns! It is called Kepler-16b, and is roughly 200 light years away from Earth. Some scientists have compared it to Luke Skywalker's home planet Tatooine, from the Star Wars movies, which also had two suns.	Nasa's Kepler telescope has recently found 216 new planets, meaning it has now discovered more than 4000 potential new worlds!
The 39-year-old, who won silver in Beijing in 2008, sustained a back injury in training. She left with a parting shot over her treatment as a cyclist. Houvenaghel will return to dentistry, where "as a woman in my thirties, I will be treated as an equal". Media playback is not supported on this device She criticised Great Britain team-mates and coach Shane Sutton when she was left out of the team pursuit races at the London Olympics two years ago. "The past decade of my life has been dedicated to professional cycling and it has, for the most part, been extremely rewarding," she said. "I have always dedicated myself 100% to my role as a natural professional sports person and I am immensely proud of my consistently high achievements from the beginning." The County Londonderry native secured the Olympic silver for GB in the individual pursuit in Beijing and also won team pursuit golds at the World Championships in 2008, 2009 and 2011. Cornwall-based Houvenaghel represented England in the 2006 Commonwealth Games before winning silver for Northern Ireland in Delhi four years later. Houvenaghel had targeted a final podium appearance in Glasgow before ending her track career, but has been forced to withdraw citing an injury suffered in training. "It is never easy to make the final decision to end one's sporting career," she added. "It is disappointing to have to withdraw from competition at the Commonwealth Games. However, I would like to wish my Northern Irish team-mates every success with their performances in Glasgow. "In the future, I hope to put something back into the sport but for now I am looking forward to pursuing my career in dentistry." Responding to Houvenaghel's comments about sexism in cycling, former Team GB track cyclist Victoria Pendleton agreed women do receive different treatment. The Olympic gold medallist and former world champion told BBC Radio 5 live: "The world of sport, like it or not, it still is very much a male-dominated arena to work in and it is tough at times." Pendleton, who retired after the 2012 Olympics at the age of 31, added: "I definitely felt in my career that sometimes I wasn't necessarily as well catered for as a female, and I had to act more like a man. "I can probably understand that she could have done with a little bit of a different support maybe."	Olympic medallist Wendy Houvenaghel has announced her retirement from cycling after pulling out of the Northern Ireland team for the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow because of injury.

He owns the Japanese Nikkei group media house, which has just acquired the Financial Times from UK publishing group Pearson for $1.3bn (Â£844m). Nikkei is one of Japan's oldest and most prestigious newspaper groups, and has managed impressive staying power at a time when the industry is on the decline. The acquisition is being called a bold and brave move for Nikkei - and it is a strategy Mr Kita has been pursuing for some time. But little is known about the man behind the deal - except for the fact that in previous interviews he has alluded to the need for the Nikkei group to expand. However, analysts are wondering whether he has paid too high a price for the luxury of owning the FT -  three times as much as it is thought the pink paper is worth. But it is the FT's digital success that Nikkei wants to emulate. In 2014 Mr Kita told a group of newspaper distributors and vendors that Nikkei had to strengthen sales and secure revenue in the light of decreasing print circulation figures. He is also a big believer in the digital subscription model - a natural synergy, then, with the FT, which now derives 70% of its business from its online and mobile audiences. And he has long held global ambitions for the firm. In 2012 Mr Kita reportedly said that he wanted to make Nikkei a global company, in the same way as the Japanese convenience store sector, which has had success in foreign markets. The acquisition of the FT allows him to realise those ambitions. But how will the two cultures of the two media houses merge? Critics say Nikkei is often a public relations machine for Japanese corporates - and that will clash with the fiercely independent Financial Times. The Nikkei group has steered clear of recent Japanese corporate scandals like Toshiba's earnings debacle and the Olympus accounting fiasco in 2011 - a story the FT broke. FT Editor Lionel Barber has assured his staff that the paper's editorial integrity will not be compromised - no matter how high the price-tag.	Tsuneo Kita is now arguably one of the most influential men on the global media landscape.
It is not the done thing to interfere in the internal affairs of a member state after all and Britain is still a member state - just about. EU Council President Donald Tusk has already offered a lesson in what to say when you know you can't say much. He wrote: "It was Hitchcock who directed Brexit - first an earthquake and the tension rises." That suggests that Mr Tusk has only a hazy knowledge of the works of Hitchcock - but it also hints at an expectation in Brussels that the Brexit debate is about to heat up. In domestic terms, Mrs May is hoping for a strong, clear and personal mandate to lead the Brexit negotiations on her own terms. And if the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn wins he would also claim endorsement for placing his own political priorities at the centre of the talks to come. But in European terms, that's something of a secondary issue. The EU Commission's lead negotiator, Michel Barnier, is going to have to deal with whoever is in residence in 10 Downing Street and the strength of the occupant's mandate won't be his concern. His team have already said that while the announcement doesn't change anything, there's a hope that it will produce a strong leader with strong backing from the people of the UK. And we can be sure this British election will be watched with even closer attention than usual - not just in Brussels but in the other European capitals where Brexit is going to be a huge issue in the years to come. First, both Theresa May and all her rivals will have to set out their visions for Brexit in much more detail than we've heard so far. British voters will demand nothing less. But in the process, the Barnier team and the governments of France, Germany and the rest will get a feeling for where the British red lines in negotiations really lie. Any British candidate worth his or her salt will try to leave room for manoeuvre in the talks to come after the election, but it will surely be impossible to campaign without giving away at least some detail. And of course there are romantics across Europe who hope that the voice of the Remainers will be heard loud and clear in the British debate to come. The hope that Brexit might be quickly reversed has pretty much faded from the European debate now, but plenty of politicians across the continent will be hoping to hear candidates putting forward the argument for a soft Brexit with the closest possible links to the EU and its single market. That may be wishful thinking, but there'll be strong support for such voices from many quarters in Europe. Europe was taken by surprise by Theresa May's announcement, but not taken aback. The EU negotiators have been working hard behind the scenes to prepare their position and their message is that they're ready to negotiate with Britain, no matter who occupies 10 Downing Street. This was already a busy year for European democracy - the Netherlands has already voted, while France votes for a president at the weekend and will hold National Assembly elections in June. Germany goes to the polls in September. But there's an awareness that the UK election will be different precisely because it will play a huge part in shaping the British negotiating position on Brexit. And, of course, there's also the fascination of the pure political theatre of it all.	The EU has to be measured in its response to Theresa May's election announcement.
Switzerland has been investigating Malaysia's scandal-hit 1MDB fund since last year. Last week, its Attorney-General Michael Lauber said $4bn (Â£2.8bn) may be missing from Malaysian state firms. A Malaysian minister said this was not possible due to extensive audits, and called the statements "premature". The indebted 1MDB state fund, set up by Prime Minister Najib Razak to pay for socioeconomic projects, has been at the centre of a political scandal in Malaysia. Mr Najib was himself cleared of any wrongdoing by Malaysian prosecutors last week. The full background to the 1MDB scandal Malaysia PM in the clear? Swiss authorities opened their investigation after 1MDB amassed more than $11bn (Â£7bn) of debt. Mr Lauber's office said on Friday there were "serious indications that funds have been misappropriated from Malaysian state companies". Some of the money, he said, had been transferred to Swiss accounts held by Malaysian former public officials and current and former public officials from the United Arab Emirates. He said the Malaysian companies concerned had made no comment on the losses believed to have been incurred. In a strongly-worded statement on Tuesday, Malaysia's communications minister Salleh Said Keruak said 1MDB had undergone extensive audits, some by international firms, and that billions of dollars "simply could not have been misappropriated under such conditions". The fund had also issued explanations and financial breakdowns about alleged losses, he said, and other state-linked firms had made public filings that showed they did not sustain losses caused by misappropriation of funds. He said Mr Lauber's comments were "very unusual and against normal protocol", and criticised him for speaking to the media, rather than to Malaysian authorities who he said had been waiting to hear from Switzerland. "These premature statements appear to have been made without a full and comprehensive appreciation of all the facts," said Mr Salleh. Mr Lauber's office told the BBC it would not comment on political statements. But it said it "took note with satisfaction of the reaction of its Malaysian counterpart and of its commitment to fully support Switzerland's request for mutual assistance". Singapore, the US and Hong Kong authorities are also probing the fund. On Monday, Singapore said it had seized a large number of bank accounts as part of an investigation into possible money-laundering linked to 1MDB. The city-state had already frozen two accounts last year. Officials said they were working with counterparts in Switzerland, the US and Malaysia in their investigation.	Malaysia has rejected allegations from Switzerland that billions of dollars may have been stolen from the South East Asian country's state fund.
Lancaster left the role on Wednesday after England's World Cup failure. Gatland's Wales beat England at Twickenham to help the hosts' demise and he has been linked with a move. New Zealander Gatland is contracted to Wales until 2019 and Thomas believes "he'll see his time out with Wales and probably go back to New Zealand". Gatland has said he intends to step down from the Wales role after the 2019 World Cup in Japan. Thomas also believes Gatland will have "one eye on coaching New Zealand after a successful run with Wales and with the British and Irish Lions". However, former Lion Thomas says he understands why the English Rugby Football Union might want to have Gatland in charge - even if Wales' record against Australia, New Zealand and South Africa has not matched their Six Nations efforts under him. "I'm sure England would want to make a move for someone like him after seeing what he's done for Wales," said Gatland. "Since he's been in charge, Wales have been an amazingly successful - unfortunately not against the mights of the southern hemisphere as much as he would like. "But we are such a force now in world rugby and are feared and respected, and that's due to the players, yes, but also due to him and the structure he's given the players. "So I'm sure they'd want him and if anybody could afford him, the RFU, I'm sure, could." South Africa's 2007 World Cup-winning coach Jake White "is interested" in the England job.	Former Wales captain Gareth Thomas doubts head coach Warren Gatland could be tempted to succeed Stuart Lancaster as England boss.
Redknapp has added goalkeeper David Stockdale, defender Marc Roberts and midfielder Cheikh N'Doye this summer. Ravel Morrison and Simeon Slavchev also remain on trial with the club, but the Blues manager wants more additions before the season begins on Saturday. "We're a little bit short at the moment - we need to improve the squad this week if we can," he told BBC WM. "We've been trying, but it's been very difficult to get the players in who we've been chasing. Hopefully we'll get there - it's not been through lack of effort." Redknapp confirmed an interest in Bristol City's Aden Flint, who may be available following the arrival of Nathan Baker from Aston Villa. "I like him but we'll only pay what we can - if he's too expensive then we'll move on," he said. Following the 2-0 friendly loss to Swansea on Saturday, Redknapp also said defender Ryan Shotton could leave if the club's valuation is met. If Shotton were to go that would leave Birmingham, who missed out on John Terry to rivals Villa, with just two centre-backs going into the opening game of the Championship season at Ipswich on Saturday. "I'm not frustrated. I'm just desperate to do well, but I need the tools to be able to do that," Redknapp said. "If I get the tools I'll do that, if I don't then it's going to be difficult."	Birmingham City will face a "difficult" season if they cannot sign new players this week, says manager Harry Redknapp.
The move showed the UK has no "real influence" over world events, Russia's foreign ministry said. Mr Johnson said events in Syria had "changed the situation fundamentally" and he would go to G7 talks instead. The UK deplored "Russia's continued defence of the Assad regime even after the chemical weapons attack on innocent civilians," he added. The foreign secretary said: "We call on Russia to do everything possible to bring about a political settlement in Syria and work with the rest of the international community to ensure that the shocking events of the last week are never repeated." Rather than travelling to Moscow to meet Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov, he will now be travelling to Lucca, in Italy, for a G7 meeting, where he will call for Russian President Vladimir Putin to pull his troops from Syria. His Russian visit, which would have been the first by a UK foreign secretary in five years, was cancelled after discussions with the US, which is sending Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to Moscow to deliver a "clear and co-ordinated" message to the Kremlin. In a statement, the Russian foreign ministry said: "During Johnson's visit to Moscow there were plans to hold open and exhaustive talks on the entire spectrum of international problems, and also to discuss the state of Russo-British relations, which have, in essence, been forced into a dead end by the UK. "The decision to call off Johnson's visit to Moscow confirms once again doubts in the presence of added value in speaking to the UK, which does not have its own position on the majority of present-day issues, nor does it have real influence on the course of international affairs, as it remains 'in the shadow' of its strategic partners. "We do not feel that we need dialogue with London any more than it does." The Russian statement added that Mr Johnson's plan to "discuss Russian support for the Assad regime" with G7 partners showed a "fundamental misunderstanding or ignorance of what is happening in Syria, Russia's efforts to settle this crisis, and the purpose of diplomacy in general". Russia and Iran have condemned US air strikes against Syria as a violation of international law. The SNP's Foreign Affairs spokesman Alex Salmond joined in with the criticism of the foreign secretary on the BBC's Andrew Marr show, saying: "Boris Johnson just looks daft. "What is the argument for not going ahead with a visit? "Rex Tillerson is going on Wednesday so it can't be that we have moved to a Cold War position of no talking whatsoever. "And the idea that the foreign secretary can't be trusted because he might pursue his own line or have an independent thought or cross over what the Americans might say makes him look like some kind of 'mini-me' to the USA and that's not a position that any foreign secretary would want to be in." Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell told Sky News the foreign secretary "should be in Moscow nowâ€¦ saying to the Russians just how appalling the situation is and the role they should play". He added: "We've got to be frank with them and we shouldn't just allow the Americans to go off and do that. We should be doing that ourselves." Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron claimed Mr Johnson was considered a diplomatic liability. "Boris has revealed himself to be a poodle of Washington, having his diary managed from across the pond," said Mr Farron. "It is pretty shameful when even Trump judges you to be a buffoon." A government source accused Mr Johnson's critics of playing politics. "It's a shame that some like Farron, Salmond and McDonnell put polls and politics above sorting out a civil war - it's very sad and shows how desperate they are," they said. BBC Political Correspondent Ben Wright said the criticism would not "unduly bother" Mr Johnson, who had spent the weekend calling counterparts, including the Germans. French and Italians, ahead of the G7 meeting. The foreign secretary would also be speaking to Mr Tillerson again, ahead of the US Secretary of State's visit to Moscow to agree a joint position on Syria. Mr Johnson's position was defended by International Development Secretary Priti Patel, who said the UK was working with the US and international partners on a co-ordinated response in the wake of US missile attacks on Syria. She told the BBC's Andrew Marr show: "This isn't just about one voice. "This is about the international community coming together and our foreign secretary is working with his American counterpart as that is the right thing to do." In January, Mr Johnson said Syrian President Bashar al-Assad should be allowed to run for election to remain in power and warned that Britain may have to "think afresh" about how to handle the crisis after failing to live up to its long-held position that the dictator must go. But sources insisted he has always believed Assad cannot remain in power. It comes as UK Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon said Russia was to blame for "every civilian death" in the chemical weapons attack last week in Syria. Sir Michael, writing in the Sunday Times, said the Kremlin was responsible "by proxy" as the "principal backer" of the Assad regime.	Russia has criticised Boris Johnson's decision to scrap a planned trip to Moscow after discussions with the US.
Researchers found that four out of five children in England who ate school lunches had tried food at school that they had not tried at home. Half of parents questioned said their children had asked for foods they had eaten at school to be cooked at home. The survey, of about 1,000 parents, found the most popular vegetables were carrots, sweetcorn and peas. Aubergine, chickpeas and spinach were among the least popular. Of the parents questioned, 628 had children who ate school lunches. (% denotes proportion of parents who said their child would eat each vegetable) England's School Food Trust commissioned the research after a survey by the Mumsnet website suggested some parents gave their children packed lunches because they thought they were too fussy to eat anything else. Trust chairman, Rob Rees, said: "Every parent knows it's a nightmare watching their child push food around the plate. "School meals can be a great way to help parents encourage their children to try new foods and to increase the variety of foods in their diet." Mumsnet co-founder, Carrie Longton, said: "Getting children to eat healthily is every parent's dream, but meal times at home can often be a battle ground and emotionally charged. "From Mumsnetters' experience it seems that once at school there's a desire to fit in with everyone else and even some positive peer pressure to boast about the variety of what foods you can eat. "School meals have also moved on quite a bit from when Mumsnetters were at school, with healthier options and more variety." School meals in England now have to comply with strict nutritional guidelines. About four in 10 primary school children in England now eat school lunches, slightly more than in secondary schools. More children in Scotland eat school lunches - about 46%. The survey was conducted online between 26 February and 5th March among a panel of parents who had at least one child in school aged 4-17 years old.	School lunches can tempt fussy eaters to try new foods, a survey for the School Food Trust has suggested.

It is hoped it will help recognise the "vital role" of those educating and caring for children aged up to seven. Education Minister Huw Lewis said the Welsh government's draft 10-year plan would help support "raise the status" of early years carers. Since 2008 children aged between three and seven have been educated through the play-based Foundation Phase. Reports into the effectiveness of the programme in May said that while it was having a positive impact on how children learned, it varied between schools and raised concerns about how well children were being prepared for exams later on in their education. The draft plan will go out to public consultation until 15 December and should be published next April. It would cover everyone who works with children in both state-run schools and nurseries and private childcare settings. The plan wants to see staff highly skilled and "highly regarded" in their career, who understand children's development, help all children to meet their potential and are bilingual. Mr Lewis is visiting a staff training session at Herbert Thompson Primary School in Cardiff to unveil the plan. He said: "The ages of 0-7 are a crucial time in every child's development. "It's important, therefore, that individuals like those I will meet today, that play such a key role in supporting children during these important years, receive the right level of support, are highly motivated and skilled and feel that they are valued. "We're determined to raise the status of careers in early years, childcare and play to a level which better reflects the vital role these practitioners play in supporting children's development." Some of the proposals include: Communities Minister Lesley Griffiths said: "We owe it to our future generations to get this right. "If we reach our goals we will improve the lives of young children, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds."	Plans to develop a highly-skilled workforce to improve early years education are to be unveiled.
Among those arrested were six suspects in Italy, four in Britain, and three in Norway. Police say some of the suspects may have travelled to Syria or Iraq. Italy's Ansa news agency said the suspects were accused of international terrorism association. The network was allegedly plotting to free its leader, Mullah Krekar, who is already in detention in Norway. Krekar, the Iraqi-Kurdish founder of the radical Islamist group, Ansar al-Islam, is one of those held in the operation. Two other suspects were arrested in Norway. The three of them are suspected of plotting attacks in Norway and other European countries, according to Italian police. They face extradition to Italy. Krekar - born Najm Faraj Ahmad - has served several jail sentences in recent years, including for praising the killing of staff at the French satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo in January. The anti-terrorism operation included investigations in the UK, Norway, Finland, Germany and Switzerland, Italian police said. Arrest warrants were issued for 17 people and at least 13 were arrested. The detainees are suspected of involvement in a group called Rawti Shax, described as a "terrorist organisation of Kurdish-Sunni origin". Some suspects could not be located, as they are believed to have travelled to Syria and Iraq to join jihadist organisations, according to the EU's judicial co-operation agency, Eurojust. Sixteen are Kurdish or Kosovan, according to Ansa news agency. In a statement, Eurojust said Rawti Shax - or Didi Nwe - represented "an evolution" of Ansar al-Islam, which is listed by the UN as a terrorist organisation affiliated with al-Qaeda. According to the Italian investigation, it was founded in Europe, with cells operating via the internet.	Police have targeted 17 people in raids in several European countries connected to a suspected jihadist network.
The incident happened on EnQuests's Thistle platform, off Shetland, last December. Rigging supervisor Steve Innes, from Sunderland, told the BBC he and fellow Wood Group contractors discovered they had been exposed to alpha radiation. EnQuest said "additional precautionary steps" had since been taken. Wood Group said it was committed to employee safety. Mr Innes - who said he has struggled to find more work since raising concerns - said the workers now faced cancer fears, and blood tests were ongoing. He said EnQuest had failed in its duty of care. The men were working at Thistle, 125 miles (201 km) north east of Shetland, doing shutdown work with pipe equipment. Mr Innes claimed they were told there was a problem two thirds of the way through the trip. He claimed a health and safety manager told them a reading had been taken the night before and all the work was stopped. He said: "We had all been working on it without the proper PPE (personal protective equipment), because they had assumed it was clear. "At first we were all in shock. "We have been exposed to radioactive material for hours at a time." He said they had been told the levels of radiation may not cause them long-term harm, but he was continuing to undergo tests. Mr Innes said of EnQuest: "They have a duty of care. Their procedures have broken down. "You can't say 'you've been contaminated but we think you'll be OK'. "I would like somebody to take the case on who's not frightened of the companies." An EnQuest spokesperson said: "EnQuest can confirm that, in December 2016, during planned shutdown activities on its Thistle platform, six personnel employed by Wood Group under a contract with EnQuest were removing a piece of pipework when they were exposed to low levels of NORM (naturally occurring radioactive material). "The level of exposure was less than 1% of the level at which it is reportable to the Health and Safety Executive however EnQuest advised the HSE of the matter at the time. "EnQuest has appropriate control measures in place which are designed to prevent exposure to NORM. "Following an investigation, additional precautionary steps have been taken to further ensure that personnel avoid any such exposure." A Wood Group spokeswoman said: "The health and safety of our people is always our top priority. "As a precaution following the incident, we downmanned our employees from the platform in order to conduct medical assessments. "We fully supported EnQuest in a detailed joint investigation and continue to reinforce the application of our health and safety procedures, to ensure the safety of our employees. "Our commitment and priority following the incident and throughout the investigation has been to the health and wellbeing of our employees." John Boland, regional officer for the Unite union, said: "Unite believes that the way these workers has been treated is terrible. "It's vital for workers' safety that there is openness and transparency about serious safety incidents, so that we can learn lessons and create a safer working environment for everyone offshore." A spokesperson for the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) said: "HSE has been made aware of this incident. "However, it was not reportable under the present RIDDOR system (Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations) and no staff raised the issue with HSE separately so no investigation has been carried out."	An offshore worker has called for action after he and colleagues were exposed to radiation, BBC Scotland can reveal.
The park authority's planning committee said the land involved was earmarked for housing. However, it added that the developer's three planning applications for the project were "not deemed to meet with a range of other planning policies". Aviemore and Highland Developments Ltd, part of the Tulloch Homes Group, had sought approval for the scheme. The housing project has been going through the planning process for more than 10 years. Among the planning committee's reasons for refusal were that environmental impacts had not been fully assessed. Rare red squirrels, capercaillie and wood ants had been recorded in the area. Committee members were also told the village's Carr Road was unsuitable as an access for the majority of houses proposed. Carrbridge, known for its 18th century packhorse bridge, has a population of about 700 people.	A plan for up to 117 new homes on a site at Carrbridge in the Cairngorms National Park has been turned down.
The IFG says legislation will be needed to establish new policies on areas such as customs and immigration. The extra measures will place "a huge burden" on Parliament and government departments, the think tank says. The attitude of the SNP may also affect the passage of Brexit laws, it adds. In its report, Legislating Brexit, the IFG says that with the average Queen's Speech announcing only 20 new bills, the introduction of 15 Brexit bills before the UK even exits the EU "will leave very little space for non-Brexit related legislation". The report comes as Theresa May travels to Swansea with Brexit Secretary David Davis, where she will talk about the "precious union" of the UK. The prime minister will meet First Minister of Wales Carwyn Jones, as well as local businesses, as she tries to show she is including all areas of Britain in negotiations with the EU. Mrs May will say: "I want every part of the United Kingdom to be able to make the most of the opportunities ahead." The IFG report anticipates the new bills will be in addition to the Great Repeal Bill, which will scrap the 1972 European Communities Act that paved the way for the UK to enter the then-EEC, ending the legal authority of EU law. The IFG - an independent charity that aims to increase government effectiveness - says departments will need "ruthlessly to prioritise" other legislation and find non-legislative routes to get the laws through, particularly given the government's narrow Commons majority. It warns that this will mean ministers having to achieve a fine balance between giving too little parliamentary scrutiny and too prolonged, in-depth examination of Brexit-related legislation. The IFG also argued that "a lack of clarity" about the role the devolved legislatures will play in legislating for Brexit could pose a problem. "The attitude that the Scottish National Party (SNP) takes to the passage of Brexit-related legislation in Westminster could affect the smoothness with which that legislation passes through Parliament if they join forces with the Labour Party and Conservative rebels," the report says. Dr Hannah White, IFG's director of research, said the government had finite resources to draft new legislation and Brexit bills would take a "big chunk" out of its capacity to legislate in other areas. "In the first session after the 2015 election the government passed 23 bills," she told BBC Radio 4's Today. "So that's roughly the capacity that there is in government to draft these bills and in Parliament, in terms of parliamentary time, to pass them." The reality, she suggested, was that the government's domestic priorities would "take a hit in the next couple of sessions". "There'll have to be some really tight prioritisation in government to work out what else is going to be done aside from the Brexit legislation. "The legislation required for Brexit will leave little parliamentary time for anything else - and making a success of it will require a large volume of bills and secondary legislation to be passed by Parliament against a hard deadline." The Queen gave Royal Assent to the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill last week, clearing the way for Theresa May to start talks to leave the European Union. The Bill allows the prime minister to notify Brussels that the UK is leaving the EU, with a two-year process of exit negotiations to follow. Mrs May says she will trigger the process by the end of the month.	Parliament might have to scrutinise up to 15 new bills to deliver Brexit, leaving little time for other legislation, the Institute for Government has warned.
It's clearly not the results. Beat Scotland at Twickenham on Saturday and they will have matched New Zealand's all-time tier one record for consecutive victories. It's not the way they finish games; under coach Eddie Jones, they have scored a cumulative 102 more points in the final quarter of matches than their opponents. It's what's been happening at the other end of the games that is raising eyebrows among critics and hopes among their opponents. Scoreless at home against Italy after 20 minutes, struggling to kick from hand, giving away set-piece penalties; 9-3 down to France, with a man in the sin bin; 10-0 down to Australia last autumn after 17 minutes, their opponents with 97% of the territory and 87% of the possession. It goes further back. Down against South Africa earlier in the autumn, six penalties conceded in the first 21 minutes. Two tries conceded in the first 20 minutes in the third of the summer Tests against the Wallabies, 10-0 down after 15 minutes of the first. You might say it doesn't matter. All those games were won. Against Wales in Cardiff England led 8-3 after the first quarter, with 74% of the possession. How could anyone complain when England have won their past 10 Six Nations matches, and are about to take on a team who haven't won in south-west London in 34 years? Jones, all those years of international coaching with four different nations whirring away in his brain, thinks otherwise. Part of that is about standards. This is a team he wants to win the next World Cup in 2019. Give the All Blacks a head-start and you are unlikely to catch them. Part of it is much more short-term: Scotland's revival in Vern Cotter's last year in charge is genuine. They are outsiders once again this weekend, but seldom in those 34 barren years have they travelled in such form. "Mate, if I knew I'd fix it," Jones said when asked this week if he had worked out what was going wrong in those opening exchanges. "And I haven't been able to fix it, so I don't know." "It's something we have been mentioning over the last few weeks," winger Jack Nowell told BBC Sport. "We've got ourselves out of jail a few times now - it is about a fast start, and putting our game on them first." Media playback is not supported on this device England's replacements - the finishers, as Jones likes to call them - have done that jail-breaking to perfection. According to Opta, the men off the bench have created more tries than those of any other nation (three scored, two assisted), made more carries, conceded the fewest turnovers and shipped only one penalty (Scotland's replacements have conceded six, France's seven). It's a wonderful asset for the coach to have. With a bench on Saturday that includes both Vunipola brothers, Jamie George, the returning Anthony Watson and the thundering Ben Te'o, it could be decisive once again this week. It does not mean the starters cannot be expected to match those same standards. Dig a hole often enough, and one day you might not be able to climb out of it. "It becomes a case of, are you riding your luck?" says Paul Grayson, the former England fly-half who is part of BBC Radio 5 live's commentary team at Twickenham this weekend. "The Italy game was as bad an opening quarter as we've seen from an England team under Jones - and that was nothing to do with 'ruckgate' (when Italy's tactic of not committing to rucks befuddled England). They were just nowhere near it mentally. "Maybe that's a timely wake-up call, because when winning becomes supposedly routine, even if you get away with a couple, you've still got to find a way to motivate yourself. If England are not quite there mentally, they look ordinary, and at some point soon they will lose." "England need to start fast," former British and Irish Lions winger Ugo Monye told 5 live's Rugby Union Weekly podcast this week. "They need to get the crowd on their side - three points, six, nine, score a try, shut out Scotland, and put a seed of doubt into their minds. "Scotland come down here with their fanfare and the bagpipes and their confidence, and everyone is aware of their threat, and if it's a close game you might just have the Twickenham crowd turning on their players a little bit." Jones has been in ornery form this week, irascible in his media conferences, hard-nosed with his players on the Pennyhill Park training pitches. "We're preparing to start well," he said irritably when announcing his selection. "We're not preparing not to start well. "It's an 80-minute game. We've got to be ahead at the 80-minute mark, and that's what we're aiming to be against Scotland. "It's like starting a 100m race. You can be ahead at the 10m mark, but you've got to be ahead at the 100m mark." Jones, a self-confessed cricket nut, might enjoy another analogy: a pair of opening batsmen playing and missing on the first morning of a Test match, the opposition fast bowler fired up and the new ball seaming and bouncing past the outside edge. What does it matter if they are 80-3 at lunch if by the close they have put on 300 for the loss of only one more wicket? "Ian McGeechan, when he was coaching Northampton and telling us how he wanted us to play, brought up the example of Wigan's very successful rugby league team," remembers Grayson. "Every team that played Wigan wanted to beat them. They would be totally up for it, and they would go toe-to-toe with them. They got to half-time, and it would be 10-8, or 6-6, or they would only be four points down. "Then they would get into the second half, and as that effort left them tired and weakened, they would roll over and Wigan would score 40 points. "I used to think, what does a game look like after 20 minutes? If I can get some points on the board, great; if they've thrown a few shots and we've had to defend for a while and they haven't got much out of it, no problem, we'll see you in the last 10 minutes of the first half and the last 15 minutes of the contest. "The opposition are always going to be at their most obstinate and most up for it in that period. Yet, barring the Wales game, England haven't had too much flow in attack in the early part of their games. It's always difficult, but if you're the best side in the world, you do it. The All Blacks always manage to come out of the blocks." Such has been the impact of England's replacements that the impression is that Jones has enviable strength in depth. He does - at prop and hooker, at scrum-half, on the wings. With first-choice lock George Kruis out injured and his preferred partner Maro Itoje shifted to six, stand-in second rows Joe Launchbury and Courtney Lawes have arguably been England's most effective players. But it is not true throughout the team. England's Test cricket team often find themselves early wickets down because they have struggled to replace Andrew Strauss alongside Alastair Cook. They can struggle on turning pitches because no-one who has come into the team has been able to match the impact of world-class spinner Graeme Swann. "Nathan Hughes looks like the Billy Vunipola of three years ago," says Grayson. "Likely to last 50 minutes or do 30 minutes off the bench, do two or three good things but also disappear for a while. "And that makes a massive difference. Take Lawrence Dallaglio out of England's World Cup-winning team and put in another number eight, and what do they look like? They're just not quite as big or powerful or dominant or vocal. "When Dallaglio wasn't playing, England weren't quite the same. And I think that Vunipola is at that point. He's an 80-minute player heading to world class. And they just haven't got that otherwise. "Billy has been out and with Chris Robshaw being out, that's two-thirds of your first-choice back row. That's a huge loss to England, because they don't have that many great back-row players."	It might sound a curiously mealy-mouthed thing to say about a team that have won their past 17 matches and sit atop the Six Nations table with consecutive Grand Slams a genuine possibility, but England's rugby team might have a problem.
Police have just released pictures of the stolen items in an attempt to trace them. The jewellery was stolen from Stanley Hunt Jewellers in Marshalls Yard, Gainsborough, on 18 November, between about 19:30 and 20:00. The Lincolnshire force is asking anyone who is offered one of the items to get in touch. One person was arrested and is currently on police bail. Police also want to hear from people who may have been in the shop at the time. More on this and other local stories from across Lincolnshire	Jewellery worth £35,000 was stolen from a shop during a Christmas lights switch-on event in Lincolnshire.
More than 90 others were wounded. The man was held in Bayingolin prefecture, to the south of Urumqi. The other four suspects died in the attack, officials told Xinhua. The authorities have announced a one-year campaign against militant violence in Xinjiang province, home to the Muslim Uighur minority. Two vehicles drove into crowds at a market in Urumqi and threw explosives in Thursday's attack. One of the vehicles then blew up. Previous reports had suggested all five suspects had died in the attack. Xinhua quoted police as saying the men took part in "illegal religious activities" and "watched and listened to terrorist violence video and audio materials". Xinjiang has seen a spate of attacks in recent years. Beijing has blamed these - and other recent mass-casualty attacks - on Uighur separatists. These include an attack in Beijing, where a car ploughed into pedestrians in Tiananmen Square, killing five people, and attacks at railway stations in Urumqi and Kunming. China says it is pouring money into the Xinjiang region, but some Uighurs say their traditions and freedoms are being crushed.	Authorities in China say they have held a suspect over Thursday's attack on a market in Urumqi in Xinjiang province in which 39 people died.
Four constituents raised the action under the Representation of the People Act 1983. They argued he misled the electorate over a memo claiming SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon would rather have seen David Cameron become prime minister. Judges have ruled that there will now be a "By Order hearing" to discuss the next part of the case. Lady Paton and Lord Matthews had heard a preliminary legal debate at a special Election Court, which examined three questions. The first was whether section 106 of the act - which makes it illegal to make or publish false statements about any candidate during an election campaign - could apply to candidates talking about themselves, as well as attacks on their rivals. The judges have ruled that the language used in section 106 was "wide enough to encompass a statement made by a candidate about himself". However, they said they wanted to hear evidence about the two remaining issues before issuing a determination on the case. These are whether the words were false statements of fact which related to Mr Carmichael's personal character or conduct, and whether they were said "for the purpose of affecting the return of any candidate at the election". The judges said they wanted to hear evidence on these issues because each case had to be considered on its own facts. Lady Paton said: "Circumstances can be envisaged where a false statement of fact is of such a nature that the effect in relation to a candidate's personal character or conduct transcends the political context. "The question of the type of relationship between the statement and the personal character and conduct of the first respondent is one which requires evidence, including evidence as to the motive or reason for giving the false statement." Mr Carmichael's QC had asked the judges to dismiss the case, on the grounds it was "irrelevant" and "bound to fail". Legal argument was heard at a special election court in Edinburgh earlier this month, which was broadcast and streamed online live. The case is believed to be the first of its kind in Scotland for 50 years. It arose from a story in the Daily Telegraph at the start of the general election campaign in April. Mr Carmichael - Scottish Secretary in the Tory-Lib Dem coalition before the election - had authorised the leaking of a civil service memo suggesting First Minister Nicola Sturgeon had told the French ambassador she wanted David Cameron to remain in Downing Street. He claimed in a TV interview the first he had heard of it was when he received a phone call from a journalist. However, the MP later admitted full responsibility for sanctioning its release, and accepted the "details of the account are not correct". The constituents who brought the petition were aided by crowd funding.	A legal challenge to Alistair Carmichael's election as MP for Orkney and Shetland is to proceed.
The trial, which targets women who are too late to undergo surgery, gives six weeks of additional chemotherapy. On average, 94 women in Northern Ireland each year are diagnosed with cervical cancer. Approximately 22 will die. Tara Millar from Belfast was diagnosed on 1 April 2015. After her diagnosis which was stage 2b, research staff at the cancer centre in Belfast offered her the choice of joining the UK trial. "After I did all the research it was a no brainer," she said. "I knew I was going to lose my hair and I had a mane of hair at the time. In fact, it weighed four pounds when it was cut off. "But I looked at the facts and it gave me a higher percentage chance of surviving. " The trial, which is called Interlace, is being conducted by Cancer Research UK. This week it awarded Â£1.3m to Belfast Experimental Cancer Medicine Centre for trials. Currently, four women in Northern Ireland are taking part in the trial, which is now in phase three of its research. Additional nurses are often required which offer one-to-one treatment to the patient. Wendy Cunningham has been a cancer research nurse for 20 years and looked after Tara. "The trial involves half of the women getting two extra drugs (carboplatin and paclitaxel) for about six weeks before their standard round of chemotherapy starts," she said. "And these drugs are already being used for ovarian and breast cancer. So we know what their side effects are like. "We know they work but they are given at a certain dose, and weekly, so it is not harmful. That means the patient, all being well, can be ready to start the standard treatment after six weeks." While not all women are suitable for the trial, even those who are eligible sometimes refuse. as it adds another six weeks to the standard round of treatment. According to Tara, who was 31 when diagnosed and is now two years in remission, the prospect of losing her hair, while daunting, was worth it. "I knew my hair would grow back and it has. I said 'yes' to the trial very easily. "I was asked, 'Do you want more drugs? If it gives you more of a chance to survive, it was just an extra six weeks'. So far it's been worth it." One of the problems around the condition is women are being diagnosed too late. Tara said she regrets not taking up the offer of a smear test in her local GP surgery and is appealing for other women to go. Richard Wilson is a consultant oncologist and a professor at the centre of cell research at Queen's University Belfast (QUB). Prof Wilson said this it was a very exciting time for Belfast and its research into cancer. He said there was one current area of research that is particularly exciting. "This is a trial in ovarian cancer and it's a trial of a drug that's being developed from research in QUB. "We're giving this drug here and in two English centres to patients for the first time ever - it's a drug called ALM201. "It cuts down the blood supply to ovarian cancer. We've finished the first phase of it and are going into the second phase." He said the number of cancer cases in Northern Ireland is increasing as people are living longer and diagnosing cancer is improving. But he had this stark warning. "Cancer is increasing inexorably year on year. It occurs in all ages but it is more a disease of older people. We're all living longer but are living longer to get cancer. "Lifestyle choices are driving more cancers as well - the increase in obesity for example is fuelling cancer, so we're getting better at treating it but we're playing catch-up all the time. Meanwhile, Tara is looking ahead. Recently married she and her husband are planning to do a lot of travelling - she is also intending to grow her hair long again. The trial is still recruiting new candidates.	The first woman to take part in a cervical cancer trial in Northern Ireland has said signing up to it was a "no brainer".
Broadchurch star Tennant plays the debauched lead character in Don Juan in Soho. Patrick Marber's play - first seen in 2006 - has been updated and now includes references to US President Donald Trump and vlogging. Speaking after Tuesday's opening night, Tennant revealed that Marber had written in a line about the Daily Mail's controversial "Legs-it" headline, but it didn't make the show. "We chickened out at the last second!" he told the BBC. "We are sprinkling occasional contemporary references as we go. We add them on the day. Prince George is in his third day now. George Osborne lasted for a weekend. Donald Trump is in there." Tennant added: "Obviously it has to relate to Don Juan and his world view. He's got this fury about the hypocrisy of the world that he's in. "The world keeps presenting itself with fresh material and we can't really resist." Marber's play is a loose adaptation of Moliere's 17th Century tragi-comedy Don Juan that transports the legendary womaniser to contemporary London. Tennant's character - known as DJ - describes himself in the play as the "Dalai Lama of debauchery". At one point his servant Stan, played by Adrian Scarborough, urges the audience: "Please don't be charmed, he's not a lovable rogue..." "It's a delicious role," Tennant said, adding that he hadn't done a play that wasn't Shakespeare in about 14 years. "I adore Shakespeare - I feel like it's in my DNA - but I'm just loving doing something that is this contemporary and that has this bite and extraordinary language." Don Juan in Soho is at Wyndham's Theatre in London until 10 June. Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

David Tennant says his latest play is being constantly tweaked to feature topical jokes - because the news keeps producing such good material.
The Yongbyon site processes spent fuel from power stations and has been the source of plutonium for North Korea's nuclear weapons programme. The reactor was shut down in 2007 but Pyongyang said last year that it was operational again. It has since conducted its fourth test of a nuclear weapon. That and its multiple missile tests broke existing international sanctions and provoked further measures from the UN and individual countries. The IAEA has no access to North Korea after being thrown out in 2009,  so relies largely on satellite data. But the agency's head, Yukiya Amano, said recent images indicated "activities related to the five-megawatt reactor, expansion of enrichment facilities and activities related to reprocessing". Vehicles have also been seen moving at the site and there are indications of warm water being discharged, which would suggest cooling operations. Other North Korean observers have also said in recent months that the plant appears to be working again. At North Korea's recent ruling party congress, leader Kim Jong-un reinforced his policy of economic development coupled with a strong nuclear programme.	North Korea appears to have restarted its nuclear facility at Yongbyon, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has said.
The current 56 day waiting time target for treatment is to be halved to 28 days, Health Minister Mark Drakeford said. Health boards have until next March to hit the new target and Mr Drakeford said there has already been "significant progress" in services. Charities have warned of the growing mental health problem in Wales. Under the old arrangements, patients had to be seen for an initial assessment within four weeks - and then there was another wait of up to eight weeks for treatment. Now that wait for treatment time after being first evaluated has been cut to four weeks too. The Welsh government said its waiting times for mental health assessment and treatment were are already more stringent than those in England. £587m spending, 2015-16 11.4% of NHS budget Women treated for mental illness 14% Adults being treated for depression 9% Rise in child and adolescent referrals since 2011  100% NHS England has a target that 75% of adults should expect treatment within six weeks and 95% within 18 weeks. Mr Drakeford said: "This announcement will help ensure timely access to treatment, ensuring people who need expert care and support receive the right services in the right place at the right time." Sara Moseley, director of Mind Cymru, the mental health charity, said the new target was "welcome" but more needed to be done, including improving the type of treatment offered to people. "I think the minister is making it very clear that mental health is a priority and we welcome that but we think this is a journey," she added. Under the old measure, 85.5% of patients in Wales were treated within the eight weeks of being assessed in June 2015. Cwm Taf health board had the best record with 97.7%  meeting the target compared to only 67.4% in the Aneurin Bevan area. But Welsh Liberal Democrat leader Kirsty Williams said hundreds of young people would  be"left behind" as they will still be subject to a longer 16 week target - one that is met only 50% of the time.	People with mental health problems are being promised faster access to treatment by the Welsh government.
French President Francois Hollande expressed "deep sadness" at the death of Huguette Dupeu in a statement. Most of the dead in the raid were foreign tourists. Two of the attackers were killed by security forces. A huge march against terrorism is planned for Sunday that will finish outside the Bardo museum. President Hollande is among those expected at the event in the capital Tunis. Lyse Doucet: Tunisia's test of transition Cradle of 'Arab Spring' under threat The museum's planned reopening earlier this week was postponed over security concerns. Schoolchildren and students were allowed in on Friday, with the general public to be readmitted Monday. The attack, claimed by Islamic State (IS), was the deadliest in Tunisia since the uprising which led to the overthrow of long-serving ruler  Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali in 2011. Over 20 people have been arrested in connection with the attack, although just two gunmen are thought to have carried out the raid. They are said to have been trained in Libya in an area controlled by IS. The Tunisian Prime Minister, Habib Essid, has admitted "shortcomings" in the country's security system and has dismissed six police chiefs over the attack.	A Frenchwoman injured in the attack on Tunisia's national museum has died of her wounds, bringing the total killed in the assault by Islamists to 22.
Malorie Bantala, 22, gave birth at 32 weeks to a stillborn boy following the assault in London in June this year. Kevin Wilson and a 17-year-old youth allegedly attacked her when she refused a termination. Both defendants deny child destruction and causing grievous bodily harm. The Old Bailey has heard how Mr Wilson became angry after Miss Bantala refused to have an abortion and told him she would keep their child. Giving evidence in his defence, the teaching assistant apologised for his behaviour towards her but maintained he was "napping" at home in Bermondsey, south-east London, when Miss Bantala was assaulted. He told jurors he was "shocked and surprised" when he found out about the pregnancy, and he had lied to Ms Bantala by saying he planned to go to Ghana because he did not want to "play happy families". He said: "I told Malorie that I'm too young to have a child [and to] have an abortion." Between May and June, Mr Wilson told jurors he had no contact with Miss Bantala after they rowed over her telling friends he was the father and accused her of sleeping with other men. Mr Wilson told jurors that in the months before Miss Bantala lost the baby, he had "moved on" with another girlfriend. He confirmed that the young woman had fallen pregnant but she did not have a child. On June 15, the day of the attack, the defendant said he had worked at a school for children with behavioural problems and walked home afterwards. Miss Bantala was left with life-threatening internal bleeding following the attack in Peckham, south-east London. Her stillborn baby boy was delivered by Caesarian section. The trial continues.	A man accused of killing his unborn baby has told a court he had "moved on" and got a second woman pregnant by the time his pregnant ex-girlfriend was attacked in the street.
It's more serious and darker, a bit like Doctor Who in its last series. Not everyone was happy with that change, but the team behind Atlantis say they are prepared for any criticism. "The show is made to work pre-watershed," says executive producer and co-creator of Atlantis Johnny Capps. "I think audiences now are a lot more sophisticated than they used to be. "Children are exposed to a lot more darker and interesting material than they used to be. "So I think you have to reflect that in the fact that your audience is more sophisticated." He says that thanks to their later time slot of 8.30pm, they're hoping to catch adults and children. And making the programme darker isn't necessarily a bad thing. "I think it's a good thing because your showing the complexities of life and emotional stories," he says. "So I think they are richer and I think a family audience will learn more about life, because the shows are darker. "So they show the light side and the dark side. They show the consequences of emotional stories." Jason, who is played by Jack Donnelly, says he was worried about the changes and how they would be received by the audience. "It's nothing like series one," he tells Newsbeat. "I was chatting with Mark (Addy) and Rob (Emms) about it the other day, and it's not even really a follow-up. "They've pretty much rebooted the entire series. "It's a lot darker, a lot more serious, all the episodes are serialised, one leads into the other, leads into the other. [They're] not standalone stories any more." But are the team prepared for the backlash? "Slightly, yes," admits Jack. "I will be honest, Mark, Rob and myself, we were concerned in the beginning because we'd sort of built up a rhythm with each other last year. "We knew what we were doing, and there was a humour that undercut all the serious moments. "And we've sort of had to step away from that, under the producer saying, 'You know this is a new direction we are going in.' "And having seen some of the episodes, just only rough cuts, I would say it might not be suitable for all the younger members of the audience [like] it was last year. "But I do think overall, the show has improved. "I think it is a positive thing, where they've taken it. And it just makes it more interesting. "So for everyone we lose, I'm hoping we're going to gain someone else."

The officer was carrying a handgun in the railway station in Inverness on Tuesday as he walked through the main concourse. Police Scotland said the officer had breached new force policy. A spokesman said he had been reminded of the strict criteria about the issue. It was a sight more common in 2013 when a policy was introduced allowing firearms officers to carry handguns with them at all times while on duty. However, after concerns from politicians, the chief constable of Police Scotland, Sir Stephen House, stated last October that specialist armed police officers in Scotland would only be deployed to firearms incidents or where there was a threat to life.	A police officer in Inverness has been photographed carrying a firearm despite assurances that sidearms would only be deployed under special circumstances.
Writing in Lancet Global Health, they predict cases will rise from 36 million to 115 million by 2050, if treatment is not improved by better funding. A growing ageing population is behind the rising numbers. Some of the highest rates of blindness and vision impairment are in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. The percentage of the world's population with visual impairments is actually falling, according to the study. But because the global population is growing and more people are living well into old age, researchers predict the number of people with sight problems will soar in the coming decades. Analysis of data from 188 countries suggests there are more than 200 million people with moderate to severe vision impairment. That figure is expected to rise to more than 550 million by 2050. "Even mild visual impairment can significantly impact a person's life," said lead author Prof Rupert Bourne, from Anglia Ruskin University. "For example, reducing their independence... as it often means people are barred from driving." He said it also limited people's educational and economic opportunities. The worst affected areas for visual impairment are in South and East Asia. Parts of sub-Saharan Africa also have particularly high rates. The study calls for better investment in treatments, such as cataract surgery, and ensuring people have access to appropriate vision-correcting glasses. Prof Rupert Bourne said: "Interventions provide some of the largest returns on investment. "They are some of the most easily implemented interventions in developing regions." "They are cheap, require little infrastructure and countries recover their costs as people enter back into the workforce," he said. The charity Sightsavers, which works in more than thirty countries to try to eliminate avoidable blindness, says it is seeing a rise in conditions such as cataracts, where the eye's lens clouds over. "Due to an ageing population and a rise in chronic disease, we expect the burden of blindness to only grow within the world's poorest countries" said Imran Khan from the charity. He said health systems in developing countries need to be improved, and more surgeons and nurses need to be trained to deliver sustainable eye health care.	The number of blind people across the world is set to triple within the next four decades, researchers suggest.
In a statement in the official Granma newspaper, the government described the project as "a serious error". "The symbols of the Revolution are and will always be sacred," it read. The colognes - Ernesto and Hugo - were unveiled on Thursday by a state laboratory in the capital, Havana. Labiofam said Ernesto, the cologne named after the Argentine-born revolutionary who helped Fidel Castro take over in Cuba in 1959, would be a woodsy and refreshing citric scent with notes of talcum powder. Hugo, named after the late Venezuelan president, would offer a softer, fruitier fragrance with hints of mango and papaya. "They will be very attractive colognes, but the names also mean a lot to us," said Isabel Gonzalez, vice-president for research and development for Labiofam during the launch. But the project was mocked in the social networks and criticised by supporters of the Cuban Revolution, who considered it disrespectful. Labiofam had been in the process of developing stylised bottles and labels for the products before putting them on sale in Cuba and overseas. "We didn't want to create propaganda, but rather pay homage to them and help their names endure," said Cuban biochemist Mario Valdes, who led the scent design team, on Thursday. The company said it had obtained the agreement of the families of Che Guevara and Hugo Chavez to use their names in the colognes. But that has now been denied by the Cuban government. "The details of this irresponsible action were discussed in detail on Friday with the company's director and the employees who presented the products, which were still being developed," read the statement of the Executive Committee of the Ministers' Council, headed by Cuban President Raul Castro. "The appropriate measures will be taken to deal with this serious error. "Such initiatives will never be accepted either by our people or by the Revolutionary Government."	The Cuban government has said it will take disciplinary action against a state pharmaceutical company that created perfumes named Ernesto Che Guevara and Hugo Chavez.
The England Lions batsman ended on 117 as the hosts made 255-6 in 92 overs in their pursuit of overhauling Kent for second spot and £43,000 prize money. Skipper Daryl Mitchell weighed in with 67 as he completed 1,000 first-class runs for the fourth time in his career. Ben Cotton picked up 3-46for Derbyshire on his firstteam recall. The visitors have not managed a Championship away victory and are hoping to avoid going an entire season without a win on the road for the first time since 2008. Worcestershire batsman Joe Clarke told BBC Hereford & Worcester: "It was quite difficult out there. The pitch is very slow. Once you get in, it is a lot easier but to start with it is very tough. "It has got a little bit more pace in it now but this morning it was very slow and credit to Daryl Mitchell. He did a fantastic job in getting us through that period. "It meant a lot to get a hundred because we've been struggling a little bit with the bat.  In the last few weeks, we haven't been getting the scores we'd have liked and to be there at the end is very pleasing. Derbyshire bowler Ben Cotton told BBC Radio Derby: "It was nice to take a couple of wickets on my return. It took me a while to settle in for the first five or six overs, then I found a nice rhythm and took the wickets we needed. "You've just got to put as many balls as you can in the right area and hopefully there is enough there to take an edge or get an lbw. "Tony Palladino and Tom Milnes started well after tea and put some pressure on them and due to their hard work I took a wicket and managed to get another near the end as well."	Joe Clarke made his fifth County Championship century of the summer as Worcestershire batted out the opening day against Derbyshire at New Road.
The 27-year-old former Aberdeen forward, who moved to Blackburn for £2m in 2011, has signed a one-year deal at League Two side Plymouth Argyle. Goodwillie won the last of his three caps five years ago, scoring his only goal from the spot against Spain. "I don't think about it too much, but as you get a bit older you think 'is it away from me?" Goodwillie said of his international hopes to BBC Radio Devon. "If you're a player at any age, if you're performing well I don't see why you can't still think about it, but right now I'm just concentrating on club football." Goodwillie scored just eight goals in two seasons at Aberdeen, and spent the final part of last season at Argyle boss Derek Adams' former club Ross County, for whom he scored once. "It helps that he (Derek Adams) is Scottish and he knows about Scottish culture and he can put his arm around you," added Goodwillie. "You're quite far from home and he'll understand that, and I think that was a big decision for me." Goodwillie was on the scoresheet for Dundee United when they beat Adams' Ross County 3-0 in the 2010 Scottish Cup final. "He's proven goalscorer, he's a player that has commanded a high transfer fee over a period of time," Adams told BBC Radio Devon. "He's a very good football player. I think it's important that we take football players to this football club that enhance us on the pitch and he'll certainly do that."	David Goodwillie says he has not given up on representing Scotland once again.
The NHS Information Centre data shows more than eight out of 10 newborns are now breastfed at least once after birth, up from six out of 10 in 1990. Experts said the increase was welcome and partly due to public awareness that "breast is best" for mother and child. But the figures do not reveal how many mums stick at it for the recommended first six months of a baby's life. Many women struggle to continue to exclusively breastfeed. And the Royal College of Midwives is concerned that some new mothers are not getting the support they need to encourage breastfeeding. Spokeswoman Jane Munro criticised the Department of Health in England for axing funding for National Breastfeeding Awareness Week, which runs this week. "We do not want to see the ground we have gained lost." She added: "We know that many women stop breastfeeding when they leave hospital. "This is why it is so important that they are able to get advice and support from their midwife, and that there are enough midwives with the time to offer these women the help they need." The government said it was committed to training up to an extra 4,200 health visitors by 2015 who would "be able to help support women who want to breastfeed but may find it difficult". According to the latest figures, breastfeeding rates were higher in England than in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales, although rates have risen in most areas. And the percentage of women who are choosing to smoke either before or during pregnancy has fallen.	More new mothers are opting to try breastfeeding their babies, latest UK figures reveal.
Energy stocks also bounced back as the price of oil stabilised after falling sharply earlier in the day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 55.47 points to 20,006.94 and the wider S&P 500 index rose 9.77 points to 2,399.29. The Nasdaq index also increased, closing up 25.42 points at 6,100.76. The US Department of Labour reported that US employers added 211,000 jobs in April, and the unemployment rate dropped slightly to 4.4% from 4.5% in March. Some car companies and other retailers have been reporting weak sales figures. However the jobs numbers were welcomed by the market as a sign that consumer spending, the mainstay of the American economy, is unlikely to diminish. GDP growth also slowed in the first three month of 2017, but the period is often subject to data distortions. The Federal Reserve said earlier this week it believed any slowdown was temporary. "The Fed has made clear it is going to look through some of the weak economic data that's been coming through as they believe the fundamentals of the economy are strong. This number is something of a vindication of that view," said Luke Bartholomew at Aberdeen Asset Management. But retail's troubles have not disappeared. Shares in the cosmetics company Revlon plunged more than 23% on Friday after the company reported a loss in the first three months of 2017, driven by sales declines in North America.	(Close): Wall Street markets closed the week on an upbeat note, after a strong US jobs report pointed to further economic growth ahead.
Last season, Tedesco took charge of second-tier FC Erzgebirge Aue for the last 11 games - his first job as a boss - and guided them to survival. Tedesco has signed a two-year deal at Schalke, who finished 10th in the German top-flight. The division's youngest coach Julian Nagelsmann, 29, has extended his deal with Hoffenheim until 2021. Nagelsmann took over in February 2016 without a proper senior licence, but led them to a club-best fourth-placed finish, qualifying for the Champions League play-offs. His excellent showing has since seen him linked several bigger clubs, including champions Bayern Munich.	Bundesliga side Schalke have appointed 31-year-old Domenico Tedesco as coach to replace the sacked Markus Weinzierl.
A two-year-old black and white cat named Patch died following a suspected poisoning in Bro Dulas, Llanidloes. Two other cats in the area were also put to sleep after they became unwell. RSPCA chief inspector Phil Lewis said: "We don't know whether these incidents were accidental or deliberate or who may have done it." Patch's owner said: "I am just so angry and devastated. Patch was such a quiet and loving cat." Mr Lewis added: "We're calling on all cat owners in the Llanidloes area to be vigilant and to take their cat to a vet straight away if they suspect they have been poisoned." Potential signs of poisoning could include vomiting, difficulty breathing, increased thirst, and appearing to be be sleepy and uncoordinated.

In the first of a series on London healthcare, BBC London political correspondent Karl Mercer speaks to those feeling the strain, including nurse Eugene Maynard; Andrew Rees, from the Liberty Road Practice; receptionist Lucy Dogley-Darani; and pharmacist Rubinder Authi.

The Richmond Park and North Kingston MP said he was "honoured" after winning 70% of the 9,227 votes cast using an online primary system. He beat London Assembly Member Andrew Boff, MEP Syed Kamall and London's deputy mayor for crime and policing Stephen Greenhalgh. Mr Goldsmith's main rival is likely to be Labour's Sadiq Khan. Mr Khan beat former cabinet minister Tessa Jowell and a number of other current MPs to win the Labour nomination last month. Caroline Pidgeon is the Lib Dem candidate, Sian Berry will contest the election for the Greens and UKIP has chosen its culture spokesman Peter Whittle. Former Respect MP George Galloway is also running. Mr Goldsmith, who was the favourite for the Tory nomination, balloted his constituents earlier this year to seek permission to stand. At the very point of his entry into the race for London mayor, Zac Goldsmith's decision revealed two big characteristics. Only a politician with an acute sense of accountability would have sought permission to stand through a ballot of his constituency members in Richmond and North Kingston. Only someone with his personal wealth would have been able to afford the estimated Â£60,000 cost of doing it. Both characteristics could come to feature heavily in the months to come. Read the whole article He won Friday's vote comfortably, getting 6,514 votes, more than the other three candidates combined. Syed Kamall came second with 1,477 votes ahead of Stephen Greenhalgh (864) and Andrew Boff (372). Mr Goldsmith - who first entered Parliament in 2010 - told the BBC's Daily Politics that he hoped his environmental record would appeal to Green and Lib Dem voters and he also hoped to "reach out" to UKIP supporters frustrated with politics as usual and the UK's relationship with the EU. Mr Goldsmith, who has confirmed he would stand down from Parliament if he became mayor, triggering a by-election, said he wanted to build on current mayor Boris Johnson's achievements. But he said anyone who attempted to replicate Mr Johnson's style of leadership would be "deluded" as he was a "unique figure" in British politics. "If people are in the market for a 'Boris mark two' are going to be very disappointed," he said, adding that people wanted someone who "will bend George Osborne's ear and get a good deal for London". He also told the BBC News Channel that high-polluting vehicles should be "phased out" of the capital's streets and that his biggest priority would be housing. Both Mr Khan and Mr Goldsmith oppose a new runway at Heathrow airport, a fact described by the British Chambers of Commerce as "depressing". Mr Goldsmith is also promising more transport investment to prevent London "grinding to a halt" and to "protect, enhance and improve access" to green spaces. Current mayor Boris Johnson will step down next year after two terms in office. He is also currently the MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip, having been returned to Parliament in May. Some Conservatives have called for an inquiry into the mayoral election process after only 9,227 people voted - compared with a 87,884 turnout for the Labour contest. In an attempt to open up the contest to people who weren't Conservative members, anyone on the electoral roll was able register to vote for Â£1. But one of the campaign teams told the BBC earlier this month the process "looked chaotic". Speaking on the BBC's Daily Politics, Mr Galloway dismissed Mr Goldsmith as a "Great Gatsby figure" who could not relate to most Londoners' lives and Mr Khan as "a very boring man". He revealed policies including compulsorily purchasing any house left vacant for more than a year and having 50% of all homes in the capital as social housing.	Zac Goldsmith will contest the 2016 London mayoral election for the Conservatives, it has been announced.
Edinburgh University found chronic pain is caused partly by a person's genetic make-up and partly by as-yet-unidentified risk factors shared by partners in the same environment. The team also identified significant overlaps between the risk factors for chronic pain and depression. The scientists said chronic pain is a common cause of disability. Scientists hope the research will help explain why some people suffer from the condition and not others. The study used data from more than 100,000 people taking part in the Generation Scotland and UK Biobank projects - major studies investigating genetic links to health conditions. The results of the collaboration with Dundee, Aberdeen and Glasgow universities are published in the latest edition of the journal PLOS Medicine. Prof Andrew McIntosh, chair of biological psychiatry at Edinburgh University, said: "We hope our research will encourage people to think about the relationship between chronic pain and depression, and whether physical and mental illnesses are as separate as some believe."	Partners of people with depression are more likely to suffer from chronic pain, a new study suggests.
Samuel Ward scored a goal either side of half-time to set up the victory, before Henry Weir made sure of the result in the final quarter. Jackson went close to scoring, shooting after the Dutch had pushed their keeper outfield, but Weir deflected it in. The result follows Thursday's 1-1 draw against hosts Germany. Britain face Belgium in their final match on Sunday (10:30 BST).	Great Britain beat the Netherlands 3-0 in the Ergo Masters Four Nations Invitational in Dusseldorf as Ashley Jackson won his 100th cap.

Open-side flanker Sam Underhill has been ruled out for four months with a shoulder injury. McCusker made 133 appearances for Scarlets before moving to London Irish last season, where he played 17 games. The 30-year-old has won 10 caps and joins Ospreys having initially signed for Welsh Premiership club Carmarthen Quins following his release from Irish. "With Sam's injury and one or two others working their way back to full fitness who are not quite there yet, we felt that we needed someone else in to help us through this period," said Ospreys head coach Steve Tandy. "We are fortunate to have someone with Rob's versatility and experience available and have brought him into the environment with a view to him helping us prepare for Zebre at home in the opening round of the Pro12 next month."	Ospreys have signed former Scarlets and Wales back-rower Rob McCusker on a short-term contract as injury cover.
Raucous fans jumped up and down during an early first-quarter touchdown in the game between the Seattle Seahawks and the New Orleans Saints. The Pacific Northwest Seismic Network detected the vibrations, measuring between a magnitude 1 and 2 earthquake. The Seahawks won the game at CenturyLink Field 34-7. Pacific Northwest Seismic Network director John Vidale told CNN his staff recorded five separate seismic events during the game. It was not the first time fan celebrations shook Seattle. In 2011, the response to another US football touchdown registered at nearby seismic recording stations. CenturyLink Field, which is open to the air, also set a Guinness World Record for noise in September.	A celebration by football fans in the US city of Seattle grew so loud on Monday evening it registered as a minor earthquake, a research group has said.
Phase one of the project will take 10 weeks to complete and will see demolition of the rear function room of the Ship and Anchor pub. An old library building will also be knocked down and a new car park built. Pembrokeshire council also wants to create a one-way system, footways and a public transport hub, with work starting later this year. The master plan includes a new link road, retail units and the demolition of buildings, including the derelict Fishguard Junior School, on 1.5 hectares (3.7 acres) of land. Councillors hope it could encourage further investment in the town.	Work has begun on plans to alleviate traffic congestion and regenerate Fishguard town centre in Pembrokeshire.
The pair appeared in front of thousands of fans at a news conference in Los Angeles - the first of four events called to promote the Las Vegas fight. "The movement, power, ferociousness - he has not experienced this," said UFC lightweight champion McGregor, 28. Mayweather replied: "I guarantee you're going out on your face or your back." The former five-weight world champion, 40, said he was an "old man" but "still had enough" to beat McGregor, who has never boxed professionally. He teased McGregor, claiming he "only made $3m in his last fight" and referenced the Irishman's submission defeat by Nate Diaz in 2016, his only loss since joining UFC three years earlier. "We know 'Mr Tap Out' likes to quit and you will wave that white flag," added Mayweather. McGregor's suit for the event contained pin-stripes which were comprised of an offensive two-word insult. He was first to break the silence as the pair stared at one another following lengthy walks to the stage. He began dancing in front of Mayweather before both addressed the crowd with expletive-laden speeches. "His little legs, little core, little head, I'm going to knock him out inside four rounds, mark my words," said McGregor. "I'm a young, confident, happy man that has worked extremely hard for this." Dublin-born McGregor said the boxing match offered "a limited set of rules" and pointed to demands he says Mayweather's team have made in agreeing to a fight which will reportedly earn each man around $100m (£78.5m) He added: "All these rules and restrictions - the gloves have to be 10oz, give him the gloves, no problem. No Mexican-made gloves, no problem. No gloves made of horse hair, fine. All I need is a gum shield, line me up to the ring and I'm good to go." The fight has drawn criticism from some within boxing given McGregor's lack of record within the sport. As both men took to the stage, their appearance was the top trend globally on Twitter. Mayweather retired from boxing after taking his record to 49 fights unbeaten with victory over Andre Berto in 2015. He has held 11 major world titles but has not stopped an opponent inside the distance since 2011, a point McGregor referenced on stage. The two men will appear at further promotional events in Toronto, Canada, on Wednesday, Brooklyn, New York, on Thursday and London on Friday.	Conor McGregor promised to knock out Floyd Mayweather inside four rounds when they faced off for the first time to promote their 26 August bout.

John Smith, 41, from Connah's Quay, Deeside, staged seven collisions in Chester allowing more than 200 people to make false personal injury claims. Ten other people were also found guilty at Manchester Crown Court for their part in the plot which police say could have totalled more than £1m. Smith, who denied conspiracy to commit fraud, will be sentenced on 23 April. All the collisions - six in Chester and a seventh on the A41 in Eastham - happened between 2010 and 2012 and followed a similar pattern, said police. A car would collide with the side of a bus causing minimal impact but resulting in multiple personal injury claims from the passengers on board. In total, 218 claims for claims were made for soft tissue damage and whiplash injuries, 177 through accident management firm Swift Accident Solutions where Smith was managing director. The scam was unearthed when First Group became suspicious about the number of collisions involving its buses. Smith, who was paid an average of £900 for each claimant he introduced to a solicitor, made a total of £159,000. But Det Insp Simon Lonsdale of Cheshire Police said the scale of the intended fraud was much larger. "Had all of the false claims created by Smith and his associates been successful we believe that the total cost would have been more than £1m, which would have been paid for by law-abiding citizens through their car insurance policies." Ten defendants who denied conspiracy to commit fraud but were also convicted were: Five other defendants had previously pleaded guilty to the same charge for their role in the fraud: Two men on trial were cleared of conspiracy to commit fraud.	The ringleader of a gang who ran a "cash-for-crash" scam involving bus passengers has been convicted of fraud.
However, there is an increased risk in certain groups, the University of Glasgow research found. Overall, veterans were at no greater risk than the general public, whilst both Falklands and Gulf War veterans had a lower risk of suicide. The team studied veterans in Scotland who served between 1960 and 2012. The study compared suicide risk among 56,205 veterans born between 1945 and 1985 with 172,741 matched non-veterans. While overall there was no significant difference in the figures for veterans and non-veterans, the risk increased for: Young veterans were not found to be at increased risk - a finding at odds with an earlier study by the Centre for Suicide Prevention which suggested that ex-servicemen under the age of 24 had a much higher rate of suicide. Asked to explain the differences, lead researcher Dr Beverly Bergman said the two studies used different data and methodologies. She said: "We have a smaller number of veterans but have studied them over a longer time period. "In our study we had only two veterans under the age of 25 who died by suicide. The two studies are not directly comparable." Dr Bergman said there was growing evidence that there is no overall difference in long-term risk of suicide between veterans and non-veterans in the UK. She added: "This is an important study which provides reassurance that military service in the last 50 years does not increase people's risk of suicide overall, but it draws our attention to those people whose increased risk may be overlooked, such as older veterans and women veterans. "It also confirms that early service leavers have a slightly increased risk but that may not manifest itself until middle age." The study, which used data from the Scottish Veterans Health Study to examine deaths classified as due to suicide or self-harm, is published in Occupational Medicine.	People who have served in the armed forces in the past 50 years are not at greater risk of suicide than those who have not, according to a new study.
The Council for Science and Technology (CST) wants "public good" GM varieties to be grown and tested in the UK. It says GM crops should be assessed individually - like pharmaceuticals - taking potential benefits into account. A new UK regulator similar to NICE (the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) should be set up, it says. The UK is a world leader in plant biotechnology research, but GM field trial applications have fallen from 37 in 1995 to just one in 2012. By David ShukmanScience editor, BBC News The controversy over genetically modifying plants is riddled with contradictions. Take the European Union. Its internal politics have caused a logjam in approvals but the EU science budget is also funding some of Britain's research. Europe grows very few GM plants but most of its imported animal feed is genetically modified. It was America's agricultural giants whose hard sell of GM put off so many European consumers but it is also US science that provides the evidence, gathered over the past two decades, that supports the assurance that GM plants and food are safe. And while Britain's leading plant scientists appeal to the prime minister to help foster this new technology, its leading supermarket chains avoid stocking GM products because no-one is asking for them. So can anything shift? The key is whether ministers can change minds in Brussels - and that's no easy task given the hostility towards GM in big players like France and Germany. A long haul lies ahead. Environment Secretary Owen Paterson has spoken in favour of increasing UK research into GM, which he said offers the "most wonderful opportunities to improve human health." The CST was asked by Prime Minister David Cameron for the latest evidence on the risks and benefits of GM technologies in agriculture, and for advice on UK and EU regulation. In turn, it commissioned a group of leading plant scientists from Rothamsted Research, The Sainsbury Laboratory and Cambridge University to make recommendations to the prime minister. The scientists say they are being held back by strict EU regulations - based on the principle that GM crops are inherently more dangerous than conventionally-bred varieties. Only two GM varieties have been licensed for commercial harvest in Europe - despite the fact that 12% of the world's arable land is cultivating GM crops. The CST report argues GM crops have now been shown to be safe - and may be necessary in future for Britain to grow its own food supply, rather than depending on imports. It says the UK should regulate commercial GM varieties of wheat and potatoes based on their individual benefits and risks - rather than follow the EU's blanket approach. It also recommends a new programme of publicly-funded field trials to test "public good" GM crop varieties, which it calls "PubGM". "Public good" traits could include nutritional enhancement, such as antioxidants in tomatoes, or vitamin A in "Golden Rice". They could also include "climate-proofing" properties such as drought resistance or heat resistance. "With PubGM, seed companies, consumers and regulators will be able to decide, based on results of experiments, whether a GM trait has proved its worth in UK crops under UK conditions," said Professor Jonathan Jones from The Sainsbury Laboratory, one of the report's authors. Sir Mark Walport, chief scientific adviser and CST co-chair, said: "We take it for granted that because our shelves in supermarkets are heaving with food there are no problems in food security. But there are. "We're part of a global food market. Competition is likely to increase. The world is already malnourished and the population is growing. "The challenge is to get more yield from the same area. GM is not a magic bullet, but it is one of a range of technologies that we should consider." The report was welcomed by Dr Julian Little, chair of the Agricultural Biotechnology Council (ABC), which represents companies including BASF, Monsanto and Syngenta. "Current EU regulation has moved in the direction of increasing political influence and undermining science. "Europe risks being left behind and it therefore remains essential that action is taken to address the dysfunctional EU approvals process so that UK farmers may, in the future, be able to realise the potential of great British biotechnology research right here in the UK." But the environmental group Friends of the Earth say GM will not make food more affordable or sustainable. "GM crops have been hugely over-hyped. Despite decades of research they have failed to deliver the benefits they have promised - and have been an expensive distraction from real solutions to the challenges we face," said senior food campaigner Vicki Hird. "Our food production system needs a radical overhaul to ensure everyone has access to healthy, affordable food that doesn't wreck the planet - but putting more power into the hands of multi-nationals is not the answer." Prof Cathie Martin, of the John Innes Centre, one of the creators of GM purple tomatoes, said changing regulations would help scientists make progress with GM varieties that benefit society. She told BBC News: "It takes 10 years to get European regulators to approve a new GM trial, and costs in the order of $150m. How can any small company do that?" "NGOs complain that GM only benefits multinational companies - but that's because they're the only ones who can afford it. We can't afford to trial crops for the public good. "If this promotes field trials where you can look at something for the public good that would be fantastic." Dan Crossley, executive director of the Food Ethics Council, said: "This report, like many focussing on GM technology, is framed around the question 'how can science and technology help secure global food supplies'. "Instead we need to ask people at the sharp end of food insecurity what can be done - by scientists and also by others - to help fix the food system. "In a resource-constrained world where a billion people go to bed hungry and a billion are obese, we must also tackle the scandal of food waste, as well as the issue of what we eat."	A new report on genetically modified (GM) crops, commissioned by the prime minister, calls for more UK field trials and fewer EU restrictions.
Celia Castedo told Bolivian media said she had warned that the plane had barely enough fuel to reach the destination in Colombia. Ms Castedo is in Brazil where she is seeking asylum. The crash killed 71 people, including most of the Chapecoense football team. The plane was taking the team to Colombia for the final of a regional tournament when it ran out of fuel, plunging into a mountainside near the city of Medellin. In a leaked tape, the pilot, Miguel Quiroga, can be heard warning of a "total electric failure" and "lack of fuel". In her letter (in Spanish) published in the Bolivian media, Ms Castedo, who worked in air traffic control, said she had no authority to stop the doomed flight, saying that was with Bolivia's civil aviation agency. She said that instead of authorising the flight, she had tried to stop it, accusing unnamed superiors of a cover-up. "I was subjected to harassment and pressure from my superiors... who ordered me to change the content of the report which hours earlier [before the flight] I had presented," she wrote. "Based on a careful examination, I had made five observations, one of the most important of which referred to the fuel economy of the flight, which happened to be equal to the flight time." Bolivia's Public Works Minister, Milton Claros, dismissed Ms Castedo's allegations. "There were no observations made to the flight plan,'' Associated Press quoted him as saying, with the minister accusing Castedo of fabricating the document after the crash to cover-up her own errors. Other Bolivian officials have urged the Brazilian authorities to return her, with one saying Ms Castedo was trying to escape justice. The head of the flight's operator, Gustavo Vargas, has been arrested over the crash. Just six people survived. One of them, crew member Erwin Tumuri, said an initial stop for refuelling in the northern Bolivian city of Cobija had been dropped by the pilot. There was no warning to the crew or the passengers that the plane was facing electrical or fuel problems, Mr Tumuri told Brazil's Globo TV.	A Bolivian aviation official says she was pressured by her bosses into changing a flight report she made for the plane that crashed last week with Brazilian team Chapocoense on board.
West Berkshire Council is setting up an emotional health academy to train psychology graduates and health professionals. The local authority said, once trained, its staff will work with children, families and schools. It wants to greatly reduce the wait mental health patients face from 12 months to less than a week. The council also hopes the new academy will stop problems escalating to the stage where they require attention from more highly trained mental health specialists. Director of Children's Services Rachael Wardell said: "It works better if you get in there sooner, when people are waiting for help their condition gets worse. "There are lots more things you can do early on without needing to go to a very high-level with a psychologist or psychiatrist. "It is a way of bridging the gap." Plans were submitted to the Department of Health in October and the council hopes to launch the academy in April while contributing about Â£120,000 a year, with local schools matching its total. Local NHS commissioning groups could also contribute Â£100,000 a year and local businesses are being asked to help out financially as well.	A council plans to employ its own staff to help young people with mental health problems.
Andrew Rosindell, a Staffordshire bull terrier owner, said resources should be used to deal with any dangerous dogs, not just the four banned breeds. His call follows the death on Thursday of three-year-old Dexter Neal, who was mauled by an American bulldog in Essex. His uncle Ashley Coe wrote on Facebook of the "absolutely devastating loss". Describing Dexter as his "darling nephew", he wrote in his post: "I can't even begin to describe the state we are all in."' Mr Rosindell, MP for Romford, said the dog which attacked Dexter was not one of the breeds banned under the 1991 act, adding "You do need a complete review of this legislation. It's simply not effective." Breeds banned by the act are pit bull terriers, the Japanese tosa, dogo Argentino and fila Brasileiro, types that have traditionally been bred for fighting. The act also makes it an offence for an owner to allow any dog "to be dangerously out of control". Mr Rosindell told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that he had long argued that the problem is not with the dogs but their owners. "There are lots of breeds of dogs that can be just as dangerous as the ones listed in the Dangerous Dogs Act so to get rid of this legislation to replace it with a more flexible form of regulation means that the police and local authorities could then focus on where there is a known dangerous dog or an irresponsible owner," he told BBC Radio Four's Today programme. "It is impossible for authorities to check every single dog [and owner]... but certainly if there's one incident then that dog and that owner would then have to be checked and warned, and if there's a second incident, then the authorities may want to take action. "The dog is like a human being almost. If you treat it badly, if you train it to do bad things, if you torment it, it will become aggressive. "The problem is they only really have powers to act on those four breeds so they waste a lot of time on dogs that aren't dangerous instead of dealing with the ones that are." Just days before Dexter's death, David Ellam, 52, from Huddersfield, was attacked and killed by a dog which had been returned to its owner despite concerns that it was dangerous. After his death, Caroline Kisko, Kennel Club Secretary, said she believed the act was "completely flawed". "We've been given the idea that we are all secure because the Dangerous Dogs Act has vilified a certain type of dog and therefore, as long as they're illegal, we're all safe," she said. "Any dog can be dangerous if it is wrongly handled and wrongly trained." The Dangerous Dogs Act has been amended over time. In 2014, sentencing guidelines in England and Wales were changed to raise the maximum jail sentence for a fatal dog attack from two years to 14. The law was also extended to include attacks which happen on private property and the police and authorities were given powers to require owners to attend dog training classes or muzzle their dog in public. A spokesman for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: "Any dog can become dangerous if it is kept by irresponsible owners in the wrong environment which is why the Dangerous Dogs Act covers any type of dog that is dangerously out of control."	The Dangerous Dogs Act has "never really worked" because it only deals with certain breeds, a Tory MP has said as he called for a review of the law.
The package on offer from the government includes a pay rise and a reduction in the retirement age. The deal will now be put to a ballot of the union's membership. Up to 10,000 prison officers in England and Wales protested last month over claims of a "surge" in jail violence. They stopped work over claims of a "surge in violence" in jails but returned to work after a High Court injunction ordered them to end their 24-hour protest. Under the agreement, prison officers will be allowed to retire at 65 - up to three years ahead of the current state pension age - at no cost to them and with full pension benefits. Uniformed staff will also be given consolidated pay rises of between 0.5% and 1% for each of the next three years, on top of usual performance-related pay increases. They also stand to receive a "recognition and retention" package totalling Â£1,000. Prisons minister Sam Gyimah, said the government and POA had also "agreed a significant number of health and safety reforms as well as new powers for governors in terms of how they deploy their staff in prisons". The POA directed members to take action last month after talks with the government over health and safety concerns broke down. It came after multiple high-profile incidents at prisons across England. In October, Jamal Mahmoud, an inmate at HMP Pentonville, died after being stabbed to death in an attack at the prison, which left two others injured. And last month prisoners caused almost Â£1m of damage during a riot at Bedford prison. Days later at HMP Isle of Wight, an inmate cut a prison officer's throat with a razor blade on the way back to his cell. In an effort to tackle safety issues Justice Secretary Liz Truss unveiled proposals detailing Â£1.3bn investment in new prisons over the next five years, including plans for 2,100 extra prison officers, drug tests for inmates on entry and exit from prisons, and more autonomy for governors. In response to the new pay deal she said: "This agreement is a good offer which rightly recognises the hard work and dedication of officers across the country doing a tough job."	Leaders of the prison officers union have reached a deal over pay and conditions following concerns about jail safety, the Ministry of Justice has said.
Some argue that Africans have never had so much artistic freedom, with a proliferation of books, paintings and films since the advent of multi-party democracy in the 1990s, and the huge advance in technology which has allowed anyone with a smartphone to publish their views across the world. But critics say artists are still subject to tight censorship, pointing out that a South African gallery was forced to remove a painting of President Jacob Zuma under political pressure, while in Uganda a play about gay rights was banned. So, just how free are Africa's artists - in film, literature and music- to tell their own stories? Here are some of their experiences: Having been born and raised in Uganda, it was the best place to be. It was my home and my everything. I remember joining the film industry in 1999 - everything was still good. You didn't need a licence to shoot a film, no censor body to look at your script. All you had to do was get a camera, run to the streets, shoot something and lock yourself in the edit suite - and later put your work out there for the world to see. Today, I have grown to understand that not all stories can be told and not just any film can be done here. There are topics you have to think twice before tackling or which, for your safety, are better left untold. Topics that will get even actors saying: "I think I am not the right person for that role" even when you know they can pull it off. Here, you don't just wake up to say you are doing a film about the gay community, a film about the political situation, or a film that paints a bad picture of Uganda. One day I had to drop a story that was inspired by the practice of female genital mutilation amongst some communities in Uganda. I had strong interviews and had done thorough research, but everyone kept telling me it was not safe to go ahead. But it is still my home, my Uganda, my everything. I don't think anyone is free to exercise their art. And that includes artists. There is a cost for this freedom. Artists are no different to the entrepreneur in that financial resources are required for the capital outlay of the "work" or manuscript. Just to be in a position to indulge in the work is time spent creating a product without the immediate benefit of financial return. Then the work needs to be produced depending upon the format and genre, requiring additional resources. In the case of a writer, it is then given to a publisher, who spends even more resources to fine-tune the manuscript with an editor, proof reader, type setter, graphic designer etc. which could take considerable time before it is placed on the retail shelf. Since the work now becomes a joint investment, compromise is inevitable. So, I guess artists are free to tell their story if they have the resources to indulge in this freedom. There is a preconceived notion and expectations regarding African films. Only in recent years have young filmmakers begun to break the mould and make more experimental films. Funders have a clear idea of the African films they want. In most instances, those that depict African people in an unconventional light are not the stories funders and international festivals want to see. They are content to see Africa as a struggling continent, which is corrupt and disease-ridden. Many urban African stories don't ever reach beyond Africa because of the question: "Are those really African stories?". The image and perception of African film is still very narrow. I want to tell African fantasy and surreal films, but the reaction is: "Why? Don't you have more important issues that you need to address in your films?" Each African film-maker has his own story to tell and we need to allow the "strange for Africa" films to co-exist with those that speak of identity, cultural and moral injustices, war, HIV/Aids etc. But things have changed slightly and filmmakers are finding alternative sources of funding - for instance, private investors - to tell stories they are passionate about. Are artists free to tell their own stories? This is a conscious choice each artist has to make. However, in the developing world, with most artists relying solely on their practice for their livelihood, they are forced to compromise their genuine stories with some "fabricated reality" that is sellable. This is further fuelled by the common perception that sales equal success, which leaves us caught up in creating fairy tales for sale. In oppressive environments, artists are intimidated and live in fear of censorship or consequences of defiance. In Kenya, having recently switched from the stereotypical African dictatorship that clamped down on creatives (mostly writers) to a more liberal government, artists whose work was inspired by bad governance, stemming from from semi-illiterate leadership, now have trouble remaining relevant. Tune in to the BBC World Service at 1900 GMT on Friday 1 March to listen to the BBC Africa Debate - Are artists free to tell their stories? - broadcast from Ouagadougou. Or take part in Twitter - using #bbcafricadebate -  Facebook or Google+ Africa Debate The whole funding situation further complicates the scenario. There's a big chunk of "development" aid and "human rights" funding channelled through non-governmental organisations. A handful of very prolific artists have gone mercenary. They've stopped making good art and have started championing the causes of civil society groups because the money is good. Artists are very free to tell their stories. A lot of factors may determine whether they do but in spaces with rampant poverty, very few can resist the temptation of a fistful of dollars to tell someone else's story. Artists just have to believe that their own stories are good enough. Filmmakers, unlike other artists such as painters and dancers, need money to practice their craft. And African filmmakers are especially burdened by a lack of money because our societies are financially strapped and they historically undervalue art. Our governments have different priorities and our businessmen see no financial value in supporting art. So African artists often find it impossible to tell their own stories. One way around that difficulty, I find, is crowd-funding. With many people making small donations, an artist can raise enough money to see through a vision that would otherwise be impossible to realise. That is how I completed my debut feature, Ninah's Dowry. But the lack of a speedy internet structure and limited access to credit cards still make crowd-funding a challenge on the continent. Another not-so-obvious deterrent to an artist's freedom is the requirement by some governments that artists submit scripts for approval before filming permits are granted. It is understandable for my beloved Cameroon, for example, to be touchy about military sites appearing onscreen. That is a credible national security issue. But, what happens if the artist's screenplay is critical of his government or country? Belonging to a very traditional society with conservative cultural values, I always have to make sure that what I say or what I do does not offend certain sensitivities. Which is not easy when you realise that the Festival in the Desert, while looking outward to the modern world, is organised by an indigenous people from a very traditionalist milieu. With the occupation of a large part of Mali and the prohibition of any form of artistic expression such as music, things became much more difficult. Expression itself was extremely risky because you exposed yourself to various punishments from the occupiers - including imprisonment. Even on the international level, to denounce what was happening could bring you trouble. At first you may be labelled as "an enemy of Islam" with all that implies in consequences for your daily life. However, this does not intimidate us because we are convinced that what we do is not against Islam. Our struggle is to show the values that are held by the majority of Muslims in the world, values of sharing and of tolerance. In its comparatively short history, African cinema has been viewed with considerable apathy and condescension both at home and abroad. No post-colonial African state in the continent has attempted to develop a cultural or film policy that incorporates critical debates, political and the poetic, since former Senegalese President Leopold Senghor's 1960s attempt with his idea of "Negritude". With funding intertwined in various governmental departments and international development resources, film-makers are often forced to avoid making films dealing with their immediate surroundings. Instead, they produce films that are neither critical of social problems and national politics nor entertaining. That said, digital storytelling has presented film-makers with essential tools to battle for the freedom to create and distribute their work. In the last 10 years, young Africans have brought amazing energy to drama by embracing digital technology and therefore producing work that has been able to reach its audience across multiple platforms providing film-makers the freedom to imagine and free from the global hegemony.	Fespaco, Africa's premiere film festival, is taking place in Burkina Faso this week, amid debate about artistic freedom on the continent.
The 50p per unit minimum was approved by MSPs in 2012, but has faced legal challenges from the drinks industry. The committee on the Licensing Act 2003 also called for an overhaul of local licensing panels after hearing of "scandalous misuse" of powers. Chair Baroness McIntosh of Pickering called the act "fundamentally flawed". The Lords Select Committee said that if minimum pricing was shown to cut down on excessive drinking, it needed to be adopted nationwide. But while the government waited for legal challenges to conclude, there were other areas of the act that could be addressed, such as abolishing local authority licensing committees and giving the powers to planning committees. "The [Lords select] committee was shocked by some of the evidence it received on hearings before licensing committees," said Baroness McIntosh. "Their decisions have been described as 'something of a lottery', 'lacking formality', and 'indifferent', with some 'scandalous misuses of the powers of elected local councillors'." Derbyshire Police told peers that the system had become "too political", with councils "frightened of making a tough decision" in case of appeals by big drinks companies. But a spokesman for licensing at the Local Government Association said scrapping the panels would be "unnecessary and ill-advised". Chris Pillai added: "Figures from 2016 show that of the more than 21,000 licence applications made to council licensing committees, less than 1% were challenged. "This reflects the fairness and sound basis licensing committees are using to make their decisions." He agreed with the peers that planning and licensing could work more closely within local authorities, but said the proposed changes would "not tackle current flaws in the Licensing Act" and failed to take into account pressures on the planning system. The select committee's report also warned that the act was not working in regulating late night openings. "Pubs, clubs and live music venues are a vital part of our cultural identity," added Baroness McIntosh. "Any decline in our cities' world-famous nightlife ought to be prevented and the businesses supported. "But the night time economy needs regulating; even in these areas of cities, residents have their rights. The current systems are not being used because they do not work." The report also called for the act to be implemented at airports and for establishments to provide a disabled access statement when applying for a licence.	Minimum unit pricing for alcohol should be rolled out across the UK if Scotland's scheme is successful, a Lords committee says.
The space agency has set out a three part plan, which it hopes will eventually lead to humans living on Mars by the 2030s. Unlike the Moon, humans have never physically set foot on Mars, we've only ever used robots like the Curiosity Rover. By exploring Mars with robots for the last 40 years Nasa has found out lots about our neighbouring planet, including the recent discovery that there is flowing icy water under the crust. They hope that this huge mission will help us to learn even more about not just Mars, but Earth as well. So, how will they do it? Since 2010 Nasa has been testing out the effects of what living in space can do to the human body, to prepare them for the journey to Mars, and also for living there. They have done this by sending astronauts to live onboard the International Space Station for long periods of time. Nasa also sent a team of scientists to live in a "Mars-like" dome for a year near a volcano on Earth, to see if the team can live happily on their own, away from everyday human-life. They are also doing a number of tests on Mars spacesuits and are currently trying out technology which could be used on the planet. In the "Proving Ground" part of their plan, Nasa hope to be able to do experiments in a "deep space" environment which will allow scientists and astronauts to return to Earth in a matter of days. Most of these experiments will take place in the Moon's orbit. Some of their plans include teaming up with the European Space Agency as part of their Asteroid Redirect Robotic Mission in 2020, which aims to take a large asteroid from a near-Earth orbit, and move it to travel around the Moon instead. Astronauts aboard the Orion spacecraft will then explore the asteroid in the 2020s, and return to Earth with samples. NASA will also be testing out its powerful new systems such as the Space Launch System rocket and Solar Electric Propulsion, which would be used for sending supplies to the team, and also for long space travel. Nasa will build a new rover robot to join the Curiosity rover in 2020. It will have lots of new gadgets to test out on Mars. One of these gadgets is called MOXIE, and will be trying to make oxygen, which is an important part of the air we breathe here on Earth, from carbon dioxide, which is in the atmosphere on Mars, Researchers will also be investigating ways astronauts can recycle better in space. In the "Earth Independent" phase of Nasa's plan, they hope to be able to send humans to Mars, using all the research and new technology they discovered in the previous phases. At the moment it takes around eight months to travel to Mars, but scientists are looking into ways to reduce this time. By 2030 Nasa are hoping they will be able to send people to the edges and surface of Mars, not just to visit, but also to live there for a long period of time. They will be looking into ways to make fuel, water, oxygen and building materials on the Red planet. Nasa will also be looking into improving their communications systems with Earth, to allow for quicker exchanges of research and data For years scientists have been curious about the Red planet, and whether or not humans would be able to live there. Recent research has proved that there is water on the planet, and that at one point Mars' climate was perhaps similar to that on Earth. Robot rovers are also looking for the possibility of whether there is alien life there too. Sending humans to the planet could help speed up the research and allow us to better understand the history of Mars. Nasa are also curious to find out if studying Mars could help us find out more about our own planet, and even how our solar system was born. However Nasa could be pipped to the post in the race to Mars, as a non-profit organization based in the Netherlands has said they will land humans on Mars by 2027.	Nasa has revealed its plans to try to get humans living on Mars in the next few decades.
Both Broughty Ferry lifeboats were called out shortly before midday, with a Coastguard helicopter later joining the search. Coastguard officers conducted a search on foot of the waterfront area close to the bridge. The lifeboats were stood down at about 15:00. A Broughty Ferry RNLI spokesman said: "The inshore lifeboat was launched within six minutes and was quickly in the area of the reported sighting. "The all-weather lifeboat Elizabeth of Glamis was launched a short time later to join the search. "Following an extensive search of the area no one was found."	A lifeboat and Coastguard search has been carried out after a report of a body seen in the water near the Tay Road Bridge at Dundee.
The message "united against extremism" will be carried on posters on 50 buses. Mr Shah was an Ahmadiyya, a group known for its peaceful interfaith concerns. He died after an attack outside his shop on 24 March. Murder accused Tanveer Ahmed, 32, from Bradford, later said he killed the 40-year-old as he had falsely claimed to be a prophet. Politicians and police joined with different community and faith groups, including Christian, Jewish and Sikh, for the launch of the campaign in Glasgow. Ahmadiyya Muslim Community Scotland president Abdul Abid said the campaign had been running in London and the Scotland launch was moved forward following Mr Shah's death. He said: "We want to reassure people and to discourage the extremists by showing that we are united. We want to increase the awareness of Islam and reverse the misconceptions. "People in other communities have given their support for this campaign and it shows that we stand united." Mr Abid said Mr Shah had donated money for a previous bus campaign raising awareness of the Ahmadiyya community, an Islamic sect which moved its headquarters to the UK after a law in Pakistan banned its members from identifying themselves as Muslims and calling their places of worship mosques. Paul Morron, president of the Glasgow Jewish Representative Council, is also backing the campaign. He said: "I think it's important for all the communities to be united but even more important that they are seen to be united. An attack on any one community is an attack on all our communities. "The purpose of extremism is to cause division and I think the response is for us to come together. We in the Jewish community stand shoulder to shoulder with our Muslim cousins." Charandeep Singh, general secretary of Glasgow Gurdwara, said he hoped the campaign would help get the anti-extremism message across. He said: "It's important that we are coming out with these types of messages. "It's already a message that we support and believe in and it's very warming for me to see different faith communities come together to support this. It shows that one Scotland approach." Mr Shah, who had moved from Pakistan to Glasgow almost 20 years ago, was found with serious injuries outside his shop on Minard Road, in Glasgow's Shawlands area on 24 March. He was pronounced dead in hospital. The shop keeper was killed just hours after he posted an Easter message on Facebook to his customers. The message said: "Good Friday and a very happy Easter, especially to my beloved Christian nationx" During the police investigation officers claimed the incident was "religiously prejudiced" and confirmed both men were Muslims. Mr Ahmed has been charged with murder and made two court appearances where he made no plea and was remanded in custody.	Scotland's Ahmadiyya Muslim community has launched a campaign promoting "peace, love and unity" following the death of Glasgow shop keeper Asad Shah.
The 24-year-old was under contract with the Stags, but Marcus Bignot's side have reached an agreement to bring him in on a free transfer. He spent the first half of the season on loan at Crawley, scoring three goals in 23 appearances. The ex-Burton player will officially join on 1 January and becomes Bignot's first signing for the Mariners.	Grimsby have signed striker Adi Yussuf on an 18-month deal from fellow League Two side Mansfield.
Iain Duncan Smith said the raft of changes should save the taxpayer Â£50bn by the end of this Parliament. He said the reforms - including tougher criteria for people seeking disability allowances - would "help and benefit" those who wanted to return to work. The Disabilities Trust charity said the reforms were part of a "triple whammy" of factors hitting disabled people. Speaking on BBC One's Andrew Marr Show, Mr Duncan Smith said: "I think the work programme is now for the first time ever working with people, who were once on sickness benefits and who are now not, going back to work." He said the new regime would see disabled benefits claimants assessed on a regular basis to determine whether they need more support with their ailments or help to get work. "There were over a million [people] not looked at for over 10 years," Mr Duncan Smith said. "These regular reviews, I think, will help them and benefit them. We haven't introduced this to hurt or to harm disabled people. The purpose is to try to support disabled people." He added: "The idea is to get people assessed so that we can find out those whose conditions have improved can then seek work, and many are going back to work now, and those who need full support get that full support." The government has been gradually rolling out the new Personal Independence Payment (Pip) to replace the Disability Living Allowance (DLA). Under the old disability regime, claimants had to prove they could walk no further than 50m without support to receive the top end of the allowance. Now, they will have to prove they can manage no more than 20m to benefit from the top payment. Mr Duncan Smith insisted this was not a straight forward change, and that people would be assessed in two stages - on how much difficulty they have in reaching 20m first, and then 50m. "What we're trying to do with these reforms is to get them to be fair so that the people who need them get better payments, and those who don't need the higher levels don't take the higher levels," Mr Duncan Smith said. Under the DLA system, he said, 70% of people who made a claim got awards "for life". The new regime will include regular face-to-face checks to establish the extent of claimants' ailments. He said the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) expects almost half of the Â£50bn in savings to come in the next 12 months. The raft of welfare reforms, introduced a year ago, also included what the government calls the removal of the "spare room subsidy" but critics call the "bedroom tax". Mr Duncan Smith, defending it, said it was not a tax but rather a "balanced and fair" policy for taxpayers. However, Sarah Clifford, director of communications for the Disabilities Trust, said the reforms were part of a "triple whammy" of factors affecting disabled people. She said the changes needed to be seen alongside cutbacks by local authorities and changes to housing benefit in England, Scotland and Wales. The housing benefits changes - dubbed the "bedroom tax" by critics but described by ministers as the removal of a "spare room subsidy" - were introduced in April last year.  A committee of MPs warned last week that the measures were creating "financial hardship and distress" for disabled people. Ms Clifford said: "We just hope Mr Duncan Smith can deliver on the promise that this will be a fair system and will not be unfair or unjust on people with disabilities." Meanwhile, the work and pensions secretary said the government had sought to end a contract with the firm Atos, which was tasked with assessing whether benefit claimants were fit to work. Mr Duncan Smith denied reports it was Atos that had ended the arrangement, saying the taxpayer would pay nothing for the early break in the contract.	The work and pensions secretary has defended changes to the welfare system, including disability benefit reforms.
The Republican Party is too badly divided. His rhetoric is too incendiary. Republican voters may be "idiots", but the general public is wiser. The US electoral map, which places a premium on winning key high-population "swing" states, is tilted against the Republican Party. About that last point. On Tuesday a survey of three key swing states - Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania - revealed a virtual dead heat between the two likely standard-bearers. Those states - which account for 67 electoral votes - all went for Democrat Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012. Add them to the states Republican Mitt Romney carried in 2012, and it delivers 273 electoral votes - three more than the 270 necessary to win the presidency. Throw in a national tracking poll released on Wednesday that has Donald Trump surging to within striking distance of Hillary Clinton, and it's a recipe for acute hyperventilation on the part of Democrats. Butâ€¦ butâ€¦ butâ€¦ cooler-heads respond. The Reuters/Ipsos national poll, which has Mrs Clinton ahead 41% to Mr Trump's 40% and 19% undecided, was conducted online. That Quinnipiac swing-state poll oversampled white voters - a demographic group that is more inclined to Republicans. In addition, it doesn't represent that big a shift from the group's battleground-state poll from last autumn, which undermines the theory that Mr Trump's support is growing. The news caused election guru Nate Silver to go on a Twitter tirade, asserting that it's way too early to start gaming out the state-by-state electoral map based on opinion polls. "The election will go through a lot of twists and turns, and polls are noisy," he writes. "Don't sweat individual polls or short-term fluctuations." Sweating polls is what US pundits and commentators do, however. And at the very least, signs that Mr Trump is within reach of Mrs Clinton should cast doubts on the early predictions that the Democrats will win in the autumn by historic, Goldwater-esque margins. Mr Trump has a pathway to the presidency. He may not get there. It is not the most likely outcome. But it's real. That linchpin of a Trump victory centres on the so-called Rust Belt - states like the aforementioned Pennsylvania and Ohio, as well as Michigan and Wisconsin. Even if Florida, due to its rapidly growing Hispanic population, goes to Mrs Clinton, Mr Trump could still win if he sweeps those states. It's a strategy that Mr Trump already appears to understand. "We'll win places that a lot of people say you're not going to win, that as a Republican you can't win," Mr Trump said at an April rally in Indiana. "Michigan is a great example; nobody else will go to Michigan. We're going to be encamped in Michigan because I think I can win it." The challenge for Mr Trump is that the mid-west, particularly, Wisconsin and Michigan, have served as a Democratic firewall that Republicans have been unable to penetrate since 1988. "These states constantly intrigue Republican presidential strategists because the Democratic advantage in them depends largely on an act of political levitation: the ability to consistently win a slightly greater share of working-class white voters here than almost anywhere else," writes the Atlantic's Ronald Brownstein. If Mr Trump is to find success, then, he likely will have to finally win over this stubborn portion of the mid-western electorate or, perhaps, energise what Sean Trende of RealClear Politics has called the "missing white voters". Trende points to a national drop-off more than 3.5 million white voters from the elections of 2008 to 2012, when population growth should have resulted in an increase of 1.5 million. These voters, he theorised, were largely working-class whites who had previously supported iconoclasts like Ross Perot, the 1992 anti-free-trade independent candidate. It's the type of voter that Mr Trump, with his populist economic pitch, has been turning out in the Republican primaries. In 2012 Mr Obama beat Mr Romney by roughly 5 million votes. If Mr Trump can bring those disaffected white voters back to the polls in 2016, it would cut into that margin. If Mrs Clinton is unable to produce the record-setting turnout among young and minority voters that Mr Obama achieved, the gap shrinks further still. That's a lot of "if's", of course. Young and minority voters - particularly Hispanics - may yet turn out to the polls in high numbers, if only to cast ballots against Mr Trump. There are already indications of record-setting Hispanic voter registration in places like California. There's also the risk that Mr Trump's reliance on populist rhetoric and controversial views on immigration could lead white-collar voters to favour Mrs Clinton. For every disaffected member of the working-class he brings in, he could lose a suburban mum or college-educated businessman. Even giving Mr Trump the benefit of the doubt, and viewing the recent polls as a trend and not a blip, there are still more electoral scenarios that end up with Mrs Clinton in the White House come 2017. For Mr Trump, the political stars have to re-align in his favour. For Mrs Clinton, a general-election status quo likely means victory.	In the week since Donald Trump effectively secured the Republican presidential nomination, a great deal of ink and airtime have been devoted to explaining why he will have a difficult time winning the presidency in the autumn.
Ross Thomson and Graham Simpson filled in a giant ballot paper outside Holyrood to underline their support for the Vote Leave campaign. Fellow Tory MSP Margaret Mitchell also backs Brexit, but party leader Ruth Davidson is in favour of remaining in. Meanwhile, the Scottish remain campaign highlighted how much research funding universities receive from the EU. Campaigning outside the Scottish Parliament alongside Scottish Vote Leave director and former Labour MP Tom Harris, the two newly-elected MSPs underlined their support for Brexit. Mr Thomson said that with moves towards further centralisation, "Europe is going in a direction that Britain can't follow". He said: "I think if we had a Europe where there was real reform and was focused again on our trading relationship, that's something I could have supported. But I just feel that at the moment, the direction of travel in the EU is about further political centralisation, further political union. "I've always been fairly Eurosceptic, but when the Prime Minister said he was going to have a referendum and get a better deal it was something I was really keen on, and in fairness to him he put a Herculean effort in. "But I'm concerned that there's no treaty change. I'm concerned that heads of state are temporary - if the German chancellor loses an election or isn't returned, and the same with the other heads of state, that negotiation we've achieved isn't long-term." Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson has voiced support for the UK remaining in the EU, but Mr Thomson said she was "really relaxed" about her MSPs taking the opposite view. He added: "She said, 'I've made a personal decision based on my experience - I want to stay in but I respect that you and others will make their own personal decision'. "Ruth is really relaxed, saying we're going to have a grown-up, adult debate about the facts and our visions for the future, and I look forward to engaging in that properly." Meanwhile, the Scotland Stronger in Europe campaign have been highlighting the contribution the EU makes to university research funding. Writing in the Herald newspaper, Glasgow University principal Prof Anton Muscatelli said there was "unequivocal" evidence that "universities in Scotland and the UK benefit massively from our membership of the EU". He said: "Scotland's universities receive Â£88.8m a year from EU sources, which is about 13% of our total research funding. "This includes research to fight malaria, research on space, and vital medical research which benefits us all." Dundee University principal Prof Pete Downes has also warned of an impact on funding from Brexit, saying universities would be "impoverished" by a vote to leave the EU. Scotland Stronger in Europe spokesman John Edward said: "Being in the EU is clearly fundamental to pan-European academic collaborations and the success of Scotland's universities, which in turn underpins jobs and investment."	Two new Conservative MSPs have joined the campaign for the UK to leave the European Union.
Having heard submissions from Glentoran and the match officials and also having viewed footage, the committee was not satisfied that an error had occurred. However, under article 16.7 of the code, it opted to suspend half of the sanction for six months. Novo's three-match ban will start on Monday, 3 April. Glenavon have the right to appeal against the disciplinary committee's decision.	Glentoran striker Nacho Novo has had a six-match ban for an attempted head-butt halved to three games by the Irish FA's disciplinary committee.
They are due to appear in court later. Nigerian newspaper Punch reports that the police raided a hotel in Lagos State on Saturday afternoon and says the hotel was cordoned off while the investigation was carried out. Homosexual acts are punishable by up to 14 years in jail in Nigeria, while gay marriage and displays of same-sex affection are also banned. Chris Ewokor, BBC Africa, Abuja Nigeria has an influential Christian evangelical movement in the south and strong support for Islamic law in the north, both of which oppose homosexuality. Since Nigeria passed a law criminalising same sex marriage and gay organisations in 2013, law enforcement agents have cracked down on people suspected of homosexuality. However, arrests are infrequent as homosexual people live in hiding. Gay people live in fear and cannot openly express their sexual orientation. They are not protected by any law so they face discrimination. Northern states under Sharia - Islamic religious law - have the death penalty for people convicted of same-sex offences which in other states carry a 14-year jail term. This is not the first arrest for engaging in acts of homosexuality but so far prosecutions have never ended in prison. Same-sex relations are explicitly banned in 72 countries, according to the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association (ILGA). The number of states that criminalise same-sex relations is decreasing annually, though, with Belize and the Seychelles repealing such laws last year. Nigeria is one of a small number of countries which has gone against a global trend. The country has had a ban on gay relationships since 1901, and in 2013 also outlawed same-sex marriages, gay groups and shows of same-sex public affection.	More than 40 men have been arrested in Nigeria over the weekend for performing homosexual acts, police say.
A series of abusive Twitter remarks were posted on an account on Tuesday, directed to Flower, who was sent off in Saturday's Super League Grand Final. Flower received a six-month ban for hitting St Helens stand-off Lance Hohaia. One comment on the single account said Flower's "last days are approaching". Other Twitter messages said that Flower "deserves to be shot", adding that he  is a "dead man". Greater Manchester Police (GMP) tweeted: "We've been made aware of abusive social media activity about the Rugby League Grand Final. Please be reassured that we are looking into this." More than 70,000 fans at Old Trafford and millions of television viewers saw the player hit Hohaia, who lay motionless on the ground just two minutes into the match. St Helens chairman Eamonn McManus said after the ban: "We must assist [Flower] in any way that we can and accept him back into the sport. There is a person behind the player, and I am reliably informed by all that it is a good one." Mr McManus also said of the punching incident: "These matters have to be dealt with by the appropriate body within the game and it has so been." A GMP spokesman said any decision to take action against Flower would depend on conversations it had with St Helens.	Death threats made against Wigan rugby league player Ben Flower, who punched an opponent as he lay on the ground, are being investigated by police.
Nintendo said such pixels were "normal and should not be considered a defect". But one analyst said if the issues were as bad as online photos suggested, it was "unbelievable" Nintendo had let them leave the factory. The Â£280 handheld console went on sale on Friday. Sales figures suggest it has become the fastest-selling games console in the Japanese company's history, with reports some shops have already sold out. In the UK, it has sold an estimated 80,000 units. The Switch can be played both on televisions and as a standalone device. It launched with a handful of games, with some critics saying there were too few. And now, thousands of customers have reported their new devices came with a screen problem. On a Reddit discussion thread, one user said: "I understand they're apparently common in devices, but in a handheld system it's a big enough annoyance for me I would not purchase a device with one." He said he had a similar problem with his Sony Playstation Portable. "My first one had dead pixels in the middle of the screen, and I brought it back to the store I purchased it in," he said. "Luckily, it was a big news story so they were allowing you to open up new boxes in the stores and turn on the device. "I went through three and on the fourth got one without any visible dead pixels." Nintendo responded on its support page, saying: "Small numbers of stuck or dead pixels are a characteristic of LCD screens." A similar pixel issue also affected Nintendo's DS, and the Japanese gaming company eventually allowed buyers to replace devices. Paul Gray, an analyst at research company IHS, said such issues should no longer be common. "In the early days of LCD screens there were lots of defects, but these days you see fewer and fewer of them," he said. "Some of the photos I've seen posted online, I cannot believe that Nintendo would have knowingly let them leave the factory like that. "Something doesn't ring quite true," he said, suggesting that some of the photos may have been doctored. Mr Gray advised anyone with a defective device to return it to the shop they bought it from. "If you are a consumer and you find it irritating, you should go back to the retailer and say that you are not happy," he said.	Thousands of owners of Nintendo's new console, Switch, have complained about dead or stuck pixels creating distracting and annoying dark squares on their screens.
A new website has been launched for farmers to find practical advice on dealing with the disease on their land. A five-point biosecurity action plan and poster campaign are also included in the initiative. The measures are being promoted by organisations such as Defra, the Animal and Plant Health Agency and the National Farmers' Union. Recommended actions include asking for a herd's TB history before buying cattle, and taking steps to minimise wildlife access to cattle, their feed and housing. Speaking at the launch of the campaign at Hartpury College in Gloucestershire, Farming Minister George Eustice said "good progress" is being made to  eradicate TB in England. However, he said reducing the risk of disease entering a farm is a "crucial element" to end the "devastation" it causes for farmers and rural communities. "There are simple and practical ways for farmers to reduce risk to their herds and neighbouring businesses from bovine TB which are set out in this new action plan approved by vets and farming experts," he added. Mr Eustice encouraged all cattle farmers to visit the new website and "think about the actions they could take to make a difference to improving the security of their herd". Bovine tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease of cattle and is caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium bovis (M. bovis), which can also infect and cause TB in badgers, deer and other mammals. Badgers, which some claim transmit TB to cattle, have been subjected to culls in Somerset and Gloucestershire for three years running. A pilot cull in Dorset is also being held this year. According to Defra, about 30,000 cattle were slaughtered in Great Britain in 2014 because of bovine TB.	The government has unveiled new tools and advice for farmers as part of a fresh campaign to tackle bovine TB.
Phoenix, 37, told Interview Magazine: "I don't want to be a part of it. I don't believe in it." The actor has been tipped for awards success The Master, in which he plays a war veteran. He was nominated for an Oscar for his role as music legend Johnny Cash in Walk The Line in 2005. Phoenix said he was dreading the upcoming Hollywood awards season which culminates with the Oscars in February 2013. "It's a carrot, but it's the worst-tasting carrot I've ever tasted in my whole life. I don't want this carrot," he said. "It's totally subjective. Pitting people against each other....It's the stupidest thing in the whole world." Phoenix described the period when Walk The Line was up for multiple awards seven years ago as "one of the most uncomfortable periods of my life." "I never want to have that experience again," he revealed in the interview. "I don't know how to explain it - and it's not like I'm in this place where I think I'm just above it - but I just don't ever want to get comfortable with that part of things." The Master, which also stars Philip Seymour Hoffman, is Phoenix's first feature film since I'm Still Here, Casey Affleck's spoof 2010 documentary which chronicled Phoenix's supposed retirement from acting to launch a career as a rapper. Phoenix called that experience "unbelievably liberating" and said it was hard subsequently to find projects that interested and excited him. "I mean, everything that they teach you when you're a kid about acting is completely...wrong. They tell you to memorise your lines, follow your light, and hit your marks. Those are the three things that you shouldn't do. "You should not learn your lines, you should not hit your mark, and you should never follow your light. Find your light - that's my opinion," he said.	Joaquin Phoenix has said he wants no part in the movie industry awards season, calling the awards "stupid" and "subjective".
The 23-year-old mutually cancelled his deal at the Shrimps earlier this month but can train at the Championship side ahead of the move. "Agreeing the pre-contract deal now, I get the opportunity to bed myself in before I can play again," he said. "I think this will be a really good challenge for me." Morecambe boss Jim Bentley had spoken about selling a player to raise funds for the Lancashire side who paid their players late at the start of November. Despite cancelling Barkhuizen's contract at the Lancashire club, they retained his rights so Preston had to pay the compensation package. Find all the latest football transfers on our dedicated page.	Preston North End have signed forward Tom Barkhuizen from League Two side Morecambe for a compensation fee with the deal to go through on 1 January.
Trinity led 16-10 at the break after tries from former Cas centre Joe Arundel (2) and stand-off Jacob Miller. Cas had mustered two first-half scores by Greg Minikin and Oliver Holmes But they added six more after the break through Andre Savelio, Luke Gale, who also kicked seven goals, Junior Moors, Ryan Hampshire, Minikin and Holmes. It was a debut try for forward Savelio, who only joined the Tigers on loan from St Helens on Wednesday, but Cas lost Rangi Chase with a back problem while Super League's leading try scorer winger Denny Solomona pulled out with food poisoning.. Wakefield, who lost centre Bill Tupou, second rower Jonny Molloy and loose forward Mickey Sio with injuries, managed just one score in the second half, from winger Reece Lyne, while Liam Finn failied to add to his two first-half kicks. The Tigers' storming finish, in which they scored five tries in 22 minutes, secured a fourth successive derby win to climb a place into sixth above Wakefield. Trinity drop to eighth thanks to Widnes beating fifth-placed Catalans, although they were all already guaranteed a top-eight finish ahead of the Super 8s split. But for Salford's six-point deduction, the injury-hit Wildcats would have ended up in the Qualifiers. Instead, they can now turn their attention to next Saturday's Challenge Cup semi-final against Warrington at Leigh Sports Village  - and their bid to reach a first Wembley final for 37 years. Wakefield coach Chris Chester: "We had one guy fit on the bench for the last 35 minutes and that really hurt us. We had a front-rower (David Fifita) who played 65 minutes in the middle which was a great achievement. "It was a good even contest for 50 minutes then we get a penalty, miss touch and we give a penalty away and concede. It took it away from us. "I'm not overly disappointed because there was bags of effort out there but we just ran out of troops, and Castleford were too good for us. "Bill came off with a hamstring injury, Jonny Molloy has got a pectoral issue and Mickey Sio got a sternum injury so those three couldn't come back." Castleford coach Daryl Powell: "It's been an incredible effort for us over 23 rounds. 14 players couldn't play today. It's been really tough. "So for us to end up finishing sixth is an awesome achievement. I'm really proud of the players. We'll reap the rewards in the long run from what's happened this year." "We were a bit helter-skelter at times but it was really pleasing how we grabbed the game in the second half. "Savelio did really well. He's trained with us a couple of times and he handled himself really well. He's a good player. I've always rated him - and he fitted into our team really well." Wakefield: Jowitt; Lyne, B Tupou, Arundel, Hall; Miller, Finn; Scruton, Sio, Fifita, Walton, Ashurst, Molloy. Replacements: Crowther, Arona, Moules, A Tupou. Castleford: Hampshire; Flynn, Crooks, O Holmes, Minikin; McShane, Gale; Springer, Milner, Patrick, Mariano, Millington, Moors. Replacements: Savelio, T Holmes, Cook, Maher. Referee: Joe Cobb (RFL).	Castleford ran in eight tries to win the Super League derby at neighbours Wakefield and move above their West Yorkshire rivals in the table.
Carl Tremarco scored a well-worked goal on the break to give the visitors a half-time lead. That was extended early in the second period when Miles Storey's effort found the net via the post before Josh Meekings side-footed a third. Kris Doolan's consolation gave home fans something to clap but Jordan Roberts notched a fourth for Caley. It was an unusually abject performance from the Glasgow Jags, who were booed several times by their own fans and now sit six points ahead of the relegation zone with three games left. Media playback is not supported on this device The match doubled as a bit of window shopping for Caley Thistle boss John Hughes, who has eyes for a few out-of-contract Partick players. One of them is Steven Lawless, who should have done better with a left-foot shot that he dragged wide following some combative work by Ryan Edwards. Partick's pre-match guide pointed out that the hosts had not scored a first-half goal at Firhill since 16 January, and it would be the visitors who hit the back of the net in the opening 45 minutes this time round in Maryhill. Inverness broke on the counter attack with just under a quarter-of-an-hour gone and a fine pass by Andrea Mbuyi-Mutombo released Tremarco. At first it seemed the Englishman was not sure what to do as he surged down the left, but he took the correct decision to plough on ahead and send a lovely finish into the far corner with the inside of his left boot. Sean Welsh watched his free-kick well saved by the diving Owain Fon Williams in the Inverness goalmouth soon after. Matters did not improve for the hosts after the break. Caley Thistle immediately extended their lead when Meekings found Storey at the right edge of the box. Hands were raised looking for an offside flag but the on-loan Swindon Town man focused on the task of hitting a shot goal-ward and in it went off the far post from a tight angle. The Firhill crowd got even more uneasy when Roberts' close-range effort hit the post following good set-up play by Mbuyi-Mutombo, then Partick goalkeeper Ryan Scully had to pull off a great stop to deny Storey getting his second of the afternoon. When Roberts' low drive narrowly missed the target moments later, the home support unleashed a barrage of boos. Meekings did not miss, however. His controlled side-foot finish from Greg Tansey's corner made it three and very, very easy for Inverness. Doolan did eventually manage to reduce the deficit, rounding Fon Williams after his initial effort was saved, but it did not take long for the visitors to restore their three-goal lead. Richie Foran - who has had so many injury problems over the last two years - came on as a substitute and delivered a cross for Roberts to slam home at the back post and remind everyone which team had been in complete control.	Inverness Caledonian Thistle guaranteed Premiership safety by strolling to victory against Partick Thistle.
They last for three months, which is long enough to sap the finances of the political parties and the energy of voters, battered by a never-ending string of cheap shots in cheap internet videos. Campaign 2015 is coming to the boil rather nicely now with the latest opinion polls suggesting that a centre-left alliance is running ahead of the hawkish Likud Party headed by Benjamin Netanyahu. That does not necessarily mean he will be forced from office - he could still form a right-wing coalition. But election night on 17 March promises to be an exciting affair. Outsiders, though, might be surprised that the moribund state of the vexed peace process between Israel and the Palestinians has never felt like a major campaign issue. It is there in the background all the time, of course, as the central historical and strategic issue that his faced this country since the Middle East war of 1967 when it captured Gaza from Egypt and the West Bank from Jordan. It captured the Golan Heights from Syria too, but that raises a different set of strategic issues which are separate from this particular diplomatic equation. Voters know that the Zionist Union - the name chosen for the alliance between Yitzhak Herzog's Labour Party and Tzipi Livni's movement Hatnuah - would approach the prospect of talking to the Palestinians about a "land-for-peace" deal with more enthusiasm than Mr Netanyahu. At one point in the campaign there was a brief controversy about whether a speech Mr Netanyahu made six years ago, cautiously embracing the concept of the Two-State solution, was still valid. His view appears to be that in an unstable Middle East where Iraq and Syria are disintegrating a newly-created Palestinian state could quickly become an ungoverned territory over-run by Islamist extremists. His many detractors might see in that an excuse for avoiding a deal for which he did not have much enthusiasm in the first place, but part of Mr Netanyahu's pitch to the Israeli people is that he is cautious in such matters - a steady, statesmanlike hand on matters affecting Israel's security. So while the peace process might be the prism through which outsiders tend to view Israeli politics, this campaign has centred much more on the economy - problems like the way in which the cost of housing outstrips the spending power of ordinary Israelis are front and centre. And what political scientists call the low-participation rate of the ultra-Orthodox communities in the economy and in the army is a major fault-line between secularists like the Yesh Atid movement and the religious parties like Shas. Yaakov Peri is a former head of Israel's internal security agency the Shin Bet - a job which required him to reflect deeply on his country's relationship with Palestinian society as he bore responsibility for neutralising the threat of militant groups. Before the last coalition collapsed he was Minister of Science and Technology and this time around he is a candidate once again for the centrist Yesh Atid. He says this is an issue where it is up to the government to lead. "The Israeli public cares about the cost of living and housing and the street doesn't feel the urgency of a deal with the Palestinians or a regional approach," he told me. "It's a reality and you should look at it when running an election campaign." You get a sense of the tensions that brought down the last coalition when you discuss the same issues with Naftali Bennett, leader of the nationalist right-wing party Habayit Hayehudi who also sat in the outgoing cabinet. He has said that there should never be a Palestinian state in the West Bank because to create one would be to create an existential threat to the Jewish State. "It would," he said, "spell calamity for the future of Israel... handing land over to Palestinians doesn't bring peace, it brings catastrophe... This formula that the West is obsessed with, of land-for-peace simply doesn't work." If the right wins the election, Mr Bennett is certain to be back in the cabinet where he would be a sceptical voice against any international diplomatic manoeuvring to get the two sides back to the negotiating table. The Palestinian people of the West Bank and Gaza of course have no vote in Israel elections - although a small number in East Jerusalem who have applied successfully for Israeli citizenship are an exception to that rule. But the Arab population of Israel itself - descendants of those who remained after the fighting in Israel's War of Independence in 1948-49 - does have the right to vote. It makes up about about 15% of the electorate and that proportion will rise as its young people reach voting age. The three traditional Arab parties have combined into a unified list which is hoping to raise the turnout in that community. And if they succeed, one of their candidates Aida Touma Suleiman told me, they intend to put the peace process back on the national agenda - not least because they see a clear link between economic and security issues. "This should be the centre of the campaign," Ms Suleiman said. "There's no issue you can discuss without making a connection to the continuation of the occupation and war policy that different governments have led in the last few years. "If you want to talk about housing you need solutions that come with resources and then you should ask where the resources are in this country." Over the course of the campaign, though, those kind of connections have not dominated the national debate here. How quickly the issue re-asserts itself will depend on whether victory goes to the left or to the right.	As electoral drama goes, Israeli election campaigns can be rather a slow burn.
Smith, 34, lost WBO title bouts with Arthur Abraham in 2014 and 2015, and trainer Joe Gallagher said Saturday's fight was a "last roll of the dice". The Briton has now been beaten seven times in his 45 professional fights. The three judges in Wetzlar, Germany, each ruled the fight 119-108 in Zeuge's favour. It was Zeuge's third defence since he won the WBA title from Italian Gioavanni de Carolis in November 2016. In a largely one-sided contest, Smith was given a count by the referee in the closing seconds of the final round despite appearing to slip. "Is it the end at world level for him? 100%. Is there another level he wants to compete at? That is one for Paul Smith," promoter Eddie Hearn said on Sky Sports. "We talked about last-chance saloon before the fight, he left it much too late. I think he will be kicking himself for that. "He had a good spell in the third round when he wobbled Zeuge, and he did in the 11th and 12th rounds too. We would have liked to see that earlier, but it's easy for us to say. Zeuge was very good and countered well."	Paul Smith lost a third attempt to win a world title as Tyron Zeuge retained his WBA world super-middleweight belt with a unanimous points decision.
The aim of the scheme was to increase bank lending by up to £70bn. The government changed the rules in January 2014, with this type of funding is no longer used to support mortgage lending. The scheme aimed to bolster the economy, by halting a downward spiral of lending and borrowing that the UK had experienced since the onset of the credit crunch and international banking crisis. Banks and building societies are able to access the funds until the end of January 2015. How does it work? In essence, the Bank of England is letting commercial banks borrow funds from it cheaply, so that the banks then pass this on in the form of cheap loans to firms. What is the point? The point is to encourage the UK's commercial banks to borrow more money, and more cheaply than at present, so they can then in turn lend it to companies who wish to borrow. Is it working? The debate is fierce. Some report banks are still unwilling to lend to business. Others say businesses are unwilling to take on new debt and are paying back loans. Either way, repayments are rising faster than borrowing, leaving the latest "net" lending figure (for the first quarter of 2014) down. So what are the mechanics of FLS? Banks and other lenders approach the Bank of England, if they want. They swap assets they already have, such as loans, with the Bank. It in turn provides them with pieces of paper known as Treasury bills, for a four-year period. The commercial banks are then able to use these bits of paper as top quality backing with which to borrow cash in the wholesale financial markets, from other lenders. With the Treasury's backing, the idea is that they will be able to borrow funds at very cheap rates. How will the taxpayer be protected in this arrangement? The collateral pledged by commercial banks will have to be worth more than the high-grade paper being offered by the Bank of England.  So, for every £1 of Treasury bills they borrow, the assets being pledged will have to be worth, say, £1.10 or £1.20. Thus if the value of that asset subsequently falls, the Bank of England will not suffer from the top slice of any loss. What about savers? They have suffered an unforeseen knock-on effect of FLS. The availability of cheap funds from the Bank means that lenders do not need to try so hard to attract funds from the general public, to then lend on to borrowers. That is why it is now almost impossible to find a savings account offering more than 3% interest.	Funding for Lending (FLS), the Bank of England and Treasury scheme, initially to boost bank lending to households and companies, opened for business at the beginning of August 2012.
The views were expressed following a meeting of the EU Negotiation Joint Ministerial Committee in London. Mr Davis said the UK government would keep Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland up-to-date about negotiations. However, Mr Russell said transparency about UK government plans was needed. Mr Davis said he wanted to hold a monthly meeting to share analysis as part of a "two-way information flow" with each of the three nations. He believed that would allow the devolved administrations to voice their views as the Westminster government prepares talks with Brussels. Mr Davis said: "Today's meeting was an important step in bringing the devolved administrations together with the UK government to discuss how we can work together to get the best deal for the whole of the UK. "Naturally, there are different standpoints around the table, but the meeting was constructive and amicable. We will meet regularly and share our latest thinking as the UK shapes its negotiating strategy. "We will work positively with the Scottish government, the Welsh government and the Northern Ireland Executive as we implement the decision of the people of the UK to leave the EU." Mr Russell said it was "good" that the process of involving the Scottish government was under way. But he added: "More than four months after the referendum the UK government has still not made its strategic intentions clear. "There was a discussion over EU market access but we do not know whether UK ministers want to remain inside the single market or the customs union. This will remain a considerable problem as we continue to promote the interests of Scotland. "The UK Government must provide greater clarity and transparency on its intentions." He said he made it "absolutely clear" that membership of the single market "is essential for the economic prosperity of Scotland". The UK government hopes the High Court judgment on how Article 50 will be triggered will be overruled on appeal to the Supreme Court next month. However, the Scottish government will seek to oppose the UK government in the Supreme Court during the appeal. The intention is for Lord Advocate James Wolffe, Scotland's most senior law officer, to apply to be heard in the case.	The UK's Brexit minister David Davis has hailed his latest talks with devolved ministers but Holyrood's Mike Russell has called for greater clarity on the "strategic objectives".
Carwyn Jones said Wales had a "proud tradition of being a friendly and hospitable nation". "The message of peace and hope is particularly poignant this year," he said, referring to the terrorist attacks in Tunisia and Paris. About 50 refugees from Syria have been re-settled in Wales with more to come. Torfaen, Ceredigion, Neath Port Talbot and Caerphilly have been the first councils to welcome refugees, with more to be dispersed to other areas in the new year. In his seasonal message to the nation, Mr Jones said:  "At Christmas, it's more important than ever that we spread the message of togetherness and unity in our Welsh communities. "We have a proud tradition of being a friendly and hospitable nation. "As fifty Syrian refugees make their home in Wales, they will be experiencing their first festive season in the UK - I'm sure they'll get a warm Welsh welcome and we wish them well in their new lives." The first minister also asked people to "spare a thought" for those working over Christmas - such as the emergency services, medical professionals, charities, care workers and the armed forces - who "all deserve our thanks". "They work tirelessly while we enjoy ourselves," he said.	Syrian refugees facing their first Christmas in Wales are sure to get a "warm Welsh welcome", the first minister has said.
The serious flooding affected large parts of county Londonderry as well as nearby Donegal. On Wednesday morning, the flood water was still several feet high outside the Drumahoe venue after the nearby River Faughan burst its banks. Friday's Championship game against Ballyclare switches to Dixon Park. The expectation is that Institute will be unable to play home games at their premises for at least a month. The club's dressing rooms are also understood to have been damaged by Tuesday's flooding which caused major disruption throughout the North West. Pictures of the damage were put on Institute's Twitter feed on Wednesday and the club described the situation as "soul destroying".	Institute's Riverside Stadium is likely to be unavailable for some time after their pitch was badly damaged by flooding on Tuesday night.
Interest and participation has increased hugely in recent years across the country, according to the Outdoor Swimming Society. Eighty outdoor swims are being held over the 2015 season, with most taking place on Christmas or Boxing Day. Safety advice has been issued by the society for the first time. Spokesman Will Cairns said it was expecting more people to take part this year in the sea, rivers and lidos. "What's interesting this year is the temperature of the water. "It's three to four degrees higher in certain places than it was this time last year. Temperature does play a part." He said overall membership numbers increased from 15,000 last year to 25,000 this year and that 40% of members now actively swim throughout the winter. "The Christmas swims very much appeal to the British psyche of doing something different, something slightly weird and wonderful," he said. - Do not take part if you are pregnant, suffer from asthma or have a heart condition. - Get warm before the swim and remove your warm clothing at the last minute. - Go in feet first, not head first, and control your breathing before immersing your shoulders. - Have low expectations of how long you will be in for or how far you will go - Dry off and put on layers within ten minutes of getting out Charlie Hoskin, 33, from Cornwall, described herself as a "granite-fleshed cold-water bathing enthusiast" who always swims in the sea at Christmas. "The sensation is truly electrifying. It is a great way to test your constitution and boost your immune system," she said. Daniel Fox has been photographing the Exmouth Christmas Day swim since 2007. "Its getting massively busy now and the atmosphere is amazing. Costumes are getting wilder and there are more and more people taking part," he said. "There are about 1,000 swimmers, thousands of spectators and tens of thousands watch by webcam too so we have a worldwide audience". Brian Thomas from the Serpentine Swimming Club in London said: "We have seen a huge growth in numbers over the past five years". He said its Christmas swimming race tradition began in 1864 and about 100 people usually take part after a strict vetting process. "Swimming in a wetsuit is cheating" he said, although stressed that the club has "strict guidelines" making sure participants have acclimatised.	Christmas swims are expected to attract bumper numbers this year due to milder winter weather and growing popularity for the craze.
It was poured onto the front archway of the hall in Clifton Street on the night of Sunday 26 August. In July, the hall was damaged in another paint attack. Police have appealed for information. They have asked witnesses to contact them or to provide details on the Crimestoppers line.	Paint has been thrown over an Orange hall in north Belfast.
Francesco Schettino was given 16 years in jail last year, after a court found him guilty of manslaughter, causing a maritime accident and abandoning ship. At the trial in Florence, he is seeking to overturn the conviction, while the prosecution seeks a longer prison term. The Costa Concordia capsized after it hit rocks close to Giglio island. On Thursday, lawyers of the 55-year-old captain are expected to argue that the disaster off Tuscany's coast was a collective failure of the ship's crew and others should share the blame for the disaster. "We will ask that the responsibility of all the protagonists in this affair be redefined, not just that of our client," lawyer Donato Laino told the AFP news agency. Salvaging the Costa Concordia Schettino, who has not yet begun his sentence, also denies that he abandoned ship before passengers and crew had been evacuated. Meanwhile, the prosecution is seeking a 26-year prison term. If Schettino loses his appeal, he can try again at Italy's highest court - the Court of Cassation. In February 2015, he was sentenced to 10 years for multiple manslaughter, five years for causing the shipwreck and one year for abandoning his passengers. Investigators had severely criticised his handling of the disaster, accusing him of bringing the 290m-long vessel too close to shore when it struck the rocks. More than 4,000 passengers and crew were forced into a chaotic evacuation. During the trial, Schettino said he had taken the ship so close to land for "commercial reasons" in a bid to please his passengers and those ashore. He had also rejected rumours that he had wanted to impress his lover, Domnica Cemortan, who was with him at the helm. Costa Crociere, the company that owned the ship, sidestepped potential criminal charges in 2013 by agreeing to pay a â‚¬1m ($1.1m; Â£779,000) fine. It is being sued by survivors, the Tuscany region and Giglio island for further damages. Five other employees, including the helmsman, were handed prison sentences ranging from 18 months to two years and 10 months in plea bargains concluded early in the investigation.	The appeals trial is to begin in Italy of the captain held responsible for the Costa Concordia cruise ship disaster in 2012, in which 32 people were killed.
Wayan Mirna Solihin, 27, met with two friends in a Jakarta cafe on January 6. She collapsed after complaining about her coffee's taste and died a short time later. Traces of cyanide were found in her coffee and tests confirmed she had been poisoned, but Indonesian officials have not named a suspect. Ms Solihin's best friend Jessica Kumala ordered the coffee, but has denied any knowledge of the cyanide. Ms Kumala's lawyer and uncle Yudi Wibowo said a third friend, Hani, had also tried the coffee. "That means Mirna did not die because of the coffee. Two people drank the same coffee but Hani is alive and well," Mr Wibowo was quoted as saying in the Jakarta Post. The friends had reportedly studied together in at design colleges and university in Australia. Australian Federal Police (AFP) confirmed in a statement that they had been asked to investigate the women's links from their time in Sydney and Melbourne. The statement said the AFP would consider the request but did not make further comment on the case.	Indonesian police have asked for Australia to help investigate the case of a woman who died after drinking cyanide-laced coffee.
Leader Brandt Snedeker, who had a share of the lead after the opening round, is on 12 under par - one clear of fellow American Kevin Kisner. Donald, five under par for the day, is 10 under, level with Americans Zach Johnson, Zac Blair and Chez Reavie. Snedeker was third at last week's Tournament of Champions in Hawaii. His short game helped him take the lead on day two as he holed out from 15 foot on his first hole, chipped in from 35 feet on his 12th, and then had a 20-footer at the next on the way to match Donald's five-under-par round of 65. "This is why we spend so much time away from our families as well as so much time on the golf course - to be in contention and have a chance to win at the weekend," he said. Fiji's Vijay Singh, 52, who is hoping to become the oldest winner on the PGA Tour, is four off the lead after a one-under round of 69. Singh had shared the early lead with Snedeker, Kisner, Ricky Barnes and Morgan Hoffman after the quintet all hit 63s in their first round. Padraig Harrington and England's Greg Owen are in a group six off the pace on six under but Northern Ireland's Graeme McDowell missed the cut by six shots on three over after a 73 on Friday.	England's former world number one Luke Donald lies two shots off the lead at the halfway point of the Sony Open in Honolulu after a second-round 65.
The poster with the phrase #prayforjosh appeared in Holywood by the A2 within the last week. It is part of a social media campaign supporting 13-year-old Joshua Martin, from Donaghadee, County Down. Life took a dramatic turn for the teenager when he was diagnosed with cancer on Christmas Eve. He was due to have an operation on his appendix at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast. However, doctors instead discovered and removed a large primary cancer and five smaller growths. The news shocked Josh's family, but since his diagnosis they have received lots of support from people all over the world. It began as a hashtag on Facebook and Instagram by Bangor Elim Church, where Josh's father is on the pastoral staff, and has since gone viral. The church's senior pastor, Gary Beattie, said he was amazed by how many people have supported Josh and his family so far. "We were in total shock when he was diagnosed, and really the family just wanted support from people and to ask people to pray for Josh," Gary said. "It certainly isn't a campaign as such, we just put the hashtag on our Facebook posts to get some of our congregation thinking about him. We had no idea that it would take off. "We would use social media quite a lot because we have quite a young congregation, and we've been posting updates about Josh from his family. "The update was shared 948 times and it's been seen by over 79,000 people. It's absolutely phenomenal. "We thought there had been a mistake, but you can look at the views and where they've come from, and there are people all over the world supporting him, which is great." But how did a social media hashtag lead to the appearance of the massive billboard? Gary said that last week a mystery donor paid for the sign and it was erected at Holywood playing fields. "We do not know where it came from, we didn't put it there, but it means a lot to have such support," Gary said. There has also been a huge outpouring of support on Twitter for the Bangor Grammar pupil, with his classmates using the now-global hashtag for their friend. As Josh's family and friends continue to support him in his recovery, it now seems there will be people all over the world will be following suit, thanks to the kindness of County Down strangers.	A large billboard has been puzzling residents of a County Down town, and commuters on the main route between Bangor and Belfast.
The district council-owned building has been upgraded for the first time in more than three decades. It includes a new 33m pool, a shallow training pool, sauna and steam room. The sports hall has been revamped and a £250,000 climbing wall has been built at the Bridgefoot centre. The double Olympic gold medallist said: "It's an amazing venue for these guys so that they can learn a life skill as well as having fun. "So many pools nowadays through this whole country have been knocked down and it's incredible that they've invested the money back to make a safe place." It is the second time Adlington has visited the centre after she opened the temporary pool provided as part of the British Gas 'Pools for Schools Programme' earlier this year. Other athletes who joined the celebrations included water polo player, Rosie Morris, who competed as the GB goalkeeper at the London Olympics in 2012. Zoe Reeve, former member of the GB Synchro Squad and triple Commonwealth Gold Medallist and three-time Olympian James Goddard also attended the event.	Olympic swimming champion Rebecca Adlington has unveiled a £5m refurbishment of Stratford Leisure Centre.
Ranieri guided Leicester to the title despite them being rated 5,000-1 shots at the start of the 2015-16 campaign. The Foxes are 17th this season and lost to League One Millwall in the FA Cup. "It is very sad," said Match of the Day presenter Lineker. "It is inexplicable to me. It's inexplicable to a lot football fans who love the game." Speaking to BBC Radio 4, the 56-year-old added: "I suppose you can explain it in terms of a panic decision and for me a wrong decision. "I shed a tear last night for Claudio, for football and for my club." After news of the 65-year-old Italian's dismissal broke on Thursday, former England captain Lineker, who played for his hometown club for seven seasons, said the "game's gone" in a post on social media. "It's a sign of modern football, what happened last season was truly extraordinary, " he added on Friday. "The lack of gratitude from the owners of the club and who knows who else involved in such a decision beggars belief. "That season will remain with us forever, it was truly special and a lot of that was down to the management. "The same guy cannot be considered incapable of doing the job a few months months later after achieving what, for me, was the biggest miracle in sport." Chelsea dismissed Jose Mourinho as manager the season after their 2015 title and Lineker says while that is "expected at big clubs", the decision to sack Ranieri "takes away from the glory" for the Foxes. "For a club like Leicester to win the league last season, the magnificence of the story, the likeability of the club under Ranieri - the ultimate gentleman - it kind of demeans the club. "Leicester were hugely popular right around the world. To do something like this now loses a lot of that popularity." France midfielder N'Golo Kante moved to Chelsea for £30m in the summer and Lineker said losing the 25-year-old was "huge". He added: "There were a whole host of things that made the season fairly inevitable in the sense it would never be anything like last season. "They had a journeyman back four that was protected brilliantly by Kante. They were an ageing back four, who are a year older. "All of a sudden they were on pre-season tours, playing Barcelona, travelling all over the world. They were not prepared for the new season and then the confidence aspect sneaks in." Former Leicester and England goalkeeper Peter Shilton, said the club's struggles this season made Ranieri's sacking understandable. Speaking to Radio 4, he said: "Going down would be a disaster for Leicester and I suppose the board have made a very brave decision. "If they stay in the Premier League then they've made the right decision. A lot of people will say there's no sentiment in football, look at what he's done for the club, but he's had a lot of the season to get things going. "There's obviously some reason why not. We're not privy to that - maybe the board are. Maybe there's unrest in the dressing room, who knows? Maybe the players just aren't performing." Leicester owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha used social media platform Instagram to explain why he sacked Ranieri. "We have done our best as management, we do not have only one problem to solve, but there are a million things to do to make our club survive, " the billionaire wrote. "Please respect my decision, I will never let the club down". This content will not work on your device, please check Javascript and cookies are enabled or update your browser Jason Bourne, BBC Radio Leicester "There's almost a sense of grief in the city today, with many having lost their 'favourite uncle'. "Claudio Ranieri was the man that brought the dream to life by winning the Premier League title. It has gone sour this term with players underperforming, new signings not working out and baffling tactics at time from the Tinkerman. "I thought they would get relegated with Ranieri in charge. I hated to say it. I hoped it wouldn't come true and I'd be proved wrong. "This gives them a chance. A different kind of chance to stay up." Phil McNulty, BBC chief football writer: It is almost the thought that dare not speak its name amid the wave of shock, outrage and disgust at Leicester's decision to ruthlessly dismiss the hugely popular 65-year-old, who won the hearts of all supporters with his good humour, class and dignity as he led the Foxes to the title. But is there actually method in what many see as the madness of the club's Thai owners? Leicester's fall has been more dramatic than anything they could have foreseen in their worst nightmares. A win for any of Sunderland, Crystal Palace and Hull City this weekend would put the Foxes in the relegation places. Wins for all three and they would be bottom by the time they face Liverpool on what will now be a highly charged occasion at the King Power on Monday. After 26 games last year they were top on 53 points, two ahead of Spurs. This season they are 17th after 25 games, with only 21 points. Last season they had lost only three games compared with 14 in this campaign, and conceded only 29 goals compared with 43 this term. Indeed, they only conceded 36 in the entire 2015-16 season. The difference is stark and, very clearly in the opinion of Leicester's owners, dangerous. Pat Murphy, BBC Radio 5 live I understand some influential players in the dressing room, who were part of the Nigel Pearson squad a couple of years ago, were making graphic contrasts with team spirit and the organisational qualities of Pearson compared with Ranieri this season. The club never really lost faith in Pearson this time two years ago. Despite the fact they were in the parlous position, the general feeling was that he had the dressing room and knew where he was going. He left in the summer of 2015 for different reasons - personal reasons associated with his son, who was on the staff. Quite clearly, Ranieri had lost a lot of key allies in that Leicester dressing room with long memories. On 7 February, Leicester issued a statement saying Ranieri had their "unwavering support". Sixteen days later they sacked the 65-year-old Italian, who had signed a new four-year deal in the summer. His departure came a day after the Foxes won praise for their performance despite losing 2-1 in their Champions League last-16 first-leg tie at Sevilla. "Ranieri was told he was sacked on Thursday afternoon in Leicester once the team returned from Spain, but the suggestion is the owners decided before that defeat by Sevilla," said BBC sports editor Dan Roan. "The decision was taken very reluctantly but the club's owners are desperate to avoid relegation and its consequences." Foxes vice-chairman Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha said: "This has been the most difficult decision we have had to make in nearly seven years since King Power took ownership of Leicester City. "But we are duty-bound to put the club's long-term interests above all sense of personal sentiment, no matter how strong that might be. "Claudio has brought outstanding qualities to his office. His skilful management, powers of motivation and measured approach have been reflective of the rich experience we always knew he would bring to Leicester City." Srivaddhanaprabha added: "His warmth, charm and charisma have helped transform perceptions of the club and develop its profile on a global scale. We will forever be grateful to him for what he has helped us to achieve. "It was never our expectation that the extraordinary feats of last season should be replicated this season. Indeed, survival in the Premier League was our first and only target at the start of the campaign. "But we are now faced with a fight to reach that objective and feel a change is necessary to maximise the opportunity presented by the final 13 games."

The apparent breakthrough came amid fresh US air strikes on Islamic State (IS) positions. Fifteen IS fighters are said to have been captured. The UK, France and Australia joined the US in dropping humanitarian aid. Some 15,000 minority Shia Turkmen in Amerli have been surrounded by Islamic State militants for two months. Military sources told the BBC's Jim Muir, who is a few miles from Amerli, that the Iraqi Army and volunteer militia entered the town on Sunday and had broken the siege. However Amerli remains dangerous because of roadside bombs left behind by IS militants, our correspondent says. No-one here seems to be in any doubt that the combination of forces backed up by Iraqi government air power has in fact broken the siege. There is a lot of celebration here, including gunfire. We cannot go into the town yet as the Islamists have left lots of booby traps and bombs. The situation inside is said to be dire because Amerli has been cut off for two months. However, what we're told from recent figures is that the number of civilians there is much fewer than thought. We were told 15-16,000, but now perhaps 2,500 remain. Many of those are now fighters, having taken up arms. So there might not be as many desperately needy people as first thought. The US military confirmed it had carried out two further air strikes on Sunday. One was near the Mosul Dam and had destroyed an IS armed vehicle. The other was near Amerli, where an IS tank was damaged. The strikes brought the overall total by US Central Command across Iraq to 120. Earlier, Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott announced that his government would join other Western countries in arming the Kurds - sending rocket-propelled grenades, mortars and assault rifle ammunition. "None of us want to get involved in another Middle Eastern war, but it is important to do what reasonably can be done to avert potential genocide," Mr Abbott said. The operation to reach Amerli began on Saturday when an alliance of Iraq government forces, Shia militias and Kurdish Peshmerga began a two-front attack on IS positions. US and Iraqi planes provided air cover overnight. Reports described it as the biggest military operation since IS began making major gains in Iraq in June. "Security forces and militia fighters are inside Amerli now after breaking the siege and that will definitely relieve the suffering of residents," Adel al-Bayati, mayor of Amerli, told Reuters. One resident of Amerli, Amir Ismael, told Reuters by phone: "I can see the tanks of the Iraqi army patrolling Amerli's street now. I'm very happy we got rid of the Islamic State terrorists who were threatening to slaughter us." The UN had expressed fears there could be a massacre if IS took the town, which lies in Kurdish-controlled Iraq. IS has been accused of atrocities in areas of Iraq and Syria under its control. The jihadists see the Shia Turkmen in Amerli as apostates. Islamic State has seized large swathes of territory in Iraq and Syria in recent months, including Iraq's second city, Mosul. Pledging allegiance to their leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the jihadists have imposed a harsh form of Islamic rule in areas under their control. The group has declared a new caliphate, or Islamic state ruled by a religious leader, and Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi has announced himself as caliph. The IS ideology has attracted would-be jihadists from a number of Western nations, including the UK, and has spread its message aggressively on social media, often posting gruesome pictures of beheadings and mass killings. The group responded to the US beginning air strikes against it by killing the American journalist James Foley.	Iraqi forces have reached the besieged town of Amerli in northern Iraq, where thousands have been trapped by jihadists, military officials say.
The 38 year old was arrested on Friday on suspicion of preventing a lawful burial and perverting the course of justice. The Met said the child had not been seen in the 11 years since its disappearance was first reported. A woman, 31, previously charged in connection with the investigation, appeared in court in July. Victoria Gayle, 31, previously of West Hendon, north London, was charged after police discovered the remains of another baby at a home in West Hendon in June. A post-mortem examination at Great Ormond Street Hospital was unable to determine the cause of the child's death. Ms Gayle is due to appear in court again in later this month. A 50-year-old woman and a 52-year-old man remain on bail.	Police investigating the disappearance of a baby born in north London in 2004 have arrested a man in Hertfordshire.
The shadow attorney general apologised for the message, which showed a terraced house with three England flags, and a white van parked outside. UKIP said she had "sneered, and looked down her nose at a white van in Strood with the cross of St George on it". Labour leader Ed Miliband was "angry" at her, a senior figure told the BBC. The resident of the house, Dan Ware, said Ms Thornberry - the MP for Islington South and Finsbury - was a "snob". "I've not got a clue who she is - but she's a snob," he told the Sun. "We put the flags up for the World Cup (in 2014) and will continue to fly them." Mr Ware, a car dealer, said he would never vote for Labour in the future, adding that it did not "matter" who was in government. "I think they (Labour) need to get out of their mansions and visit the working class. Her and Ed (Miliband) should come and say sorry to me." Ms Thornberry posted the image on Thursday, while voting was taking place in the by-election in Kent. Alongside the picture, she wrote: "Image from Rochester." Labour came third in the high-profile poll behind UKIP, which won the seat and saw its second MP elected to Westminster. Speaking outside her London home, Ms Thornberry said she had "made a mistake" and apologised "if she had upset or insulted anybody". Shadow Foreign Secretary Douglas Alexander said Labour leader Ed Miliband had "not held back" in expressing his dismay with the MP's actions. "Anyone who wants to stand for election and be successful next May has to start with a fundamental and deep respect for voters," he told BBC Radio 4's Today. "The anger Ed (Miliband) felt when he saw that tweet reflected his understanding that we need to earn the support of people around the country." BBC political editor Nick Robinson said the tweet had "given the Tory press an alternative narrative" to the party's defeat in Rochester. He said: "It is the most extraordinary self-inflicted wound I have seen an opposition party inflict on themselves in many, many years." Prime Minister David Cameron said the Labour MP's actions were "completely appalling", suggesting that she was "sneering at people who work hard, are patriotic and love their country". The 54-year-old entered Parliament as MP for Islington South and Finsbury in 2005 and served as shadow energy and health spokeswoman before taking the role of shadow attorney general in 2011. The daughter of a former assistant secretary general of the United Nations, she was born in Surrey and was called to the bar in 1983, specialising in criminal law. She had a majority of 3,569 over the Liberal Democrat candidate at the 2010 general election. Rochester and Strood: What's next for parties? How unusual is Rochester and Strood? Ms Thornberry is believed to have had two conversations with Labour leader Ed Miliband after posting the tweet, and offered her resignation during the second one. In a statement released by the Labour Party, Ms Thornberry said: "Earlier today I sent a tweet which has caused offence to some people. "That was never my intention and I have apologised. However I will not let anything distract from Labour's chance to win the coming general election." "I have therefore tonight told Ed Miliband I will resign from the shadow cabinet." Labour MPs said she had been right to stand down, Chris Bryant telling the BBC "the first rule of politics is surely that you respect the voters". "She was absolutely wrong to tweet what she did," he said. "All I can say is, if somebody came into my constituency and did that, I would be furious." And John Mann said the incident was "horrendous" for Labour. "It insults people like me, it insults the people I know - my friends and family - Labour voters across the country because white vans, England flags, they're Labour values and actually pretty routine Labour values for most of us," he told Today. He praised Mr Miliband's response, adding: "I think this is a different approach from the Labour leader and his message came out very, very clearly last night and she's had to go, she's been forced out." But Mr Farage suggested the episode reflected broader attitudes within parts of the Labour Party. "The Labour Party hate the concept of Englishness," he told the BBC News Channel. "They have done for a very long time. "New Labour can't even stand the concept of patriotism. They think the flag somehow is unpleasant, backward-looking and nasty. People like Emily Thornberry would rather we had that blue flag with 12 stars on it that comes to us from Brussels."	Emily Thornberry has resigned from Labour's front bench after sending a tweet during the Rochester and Strood by-election which was branded "snobby".

MEP Nathan Gill said he "could not stay in a party that suddenly represented all the things that for 12 years I said it didn't represent". Ms Waters, who founded the Sharia Watch pressure group, is one of 11 candidates in the race. Her bid has split the party, with many angry she has been allowed to run. Former Labour activist Ms Waters believes her anti-Islam message, including a proposed ban on burkas, the closure of sharia councils and a temporary freeze on all immigration, will appeal to many voters. She has argued UKIP could regain support if it had the "guts" to be "honest about Islam" and challenge the view that it had "nothing to do" with jihadist violence. But Mr Gill said he could not support those views and said "a lot of my colleagues feel the same way as well". He told BBC Radio Wales' Sunday Supplement programme: "I don't have a dog in this race, I am not backing any of the candidates. "But I do know that I have got red lines and if I see the party going in any direction that it absolutely should not be going in then I cannot remain a member of that party." The candidates to replace Paul Nuttall - who stood down after UKIP's poor performance in June's general election - are: Voting papers will be sent to party members over the next few weeks and the new leader will be announced at the party's annual conference in Torquay, held on 29 and 30 September. Mr Gill also criticised the party's delay in addressing concerns raised about UKIP assembly member Michelle Brown, following a row over racial slurs she made about a Labour MP. The North Wales AM called Streatham MP Chuka Umunna a "coconut" in a recorded call in May 2016 to her then senior adviser Nigel Williams. She later apologised. Mr Gill claimed the issue, which the party postponed making a decision on at its National Executive Meeting, had been "kicked into the long grass". "I have said very clearly that I think that Michelle Brown should be expelled from the party," he said. "We have to show, very clearly, what we are not - and we are not a racist party and I fought so strongly for that."	The former leader of UKIP in Wales has said he would leave the party if anti-Islam campaigner Anne Marie Waters won the leadership election.
The 1 mile (1.5km) park between Alum Chine and Southbourne in Bournemouth is due to open on 13 April. The ??700,000 attraction will include a multi-sports arena, sporting events site and a dinghy park. The work on the park will also see repairs made to a ??3.2m artificial surf reef at Boscombe, which was closed in 2011 after a boat propeller damaged it. Local traders, hoteliers and businesses attended a series of events in January to give their feedback on the park's designs and potential benefits. Funding for the park has been assisted by a ??254,000 grant from the government's Coastal Communities Fund.	Designs for a dedicated activity park along the Dorset coast have been unveiled.
The abuse took place while the boys were living at Belmont House, in Baker Street, Stockport, Greater Manchester, in about 1989 and 1990. The home, which was also known as Belmont Assessment Centre, has closed. Police have made "extensive" inquiries and are now appealing for anyone who worked or lived at the home during that period to contact them. Det Con Karen Wileman said: "People who were previously residents or members of staff at the home may have moved to different areas of the country, or even abroad. "We are keen to speak to anyone who was involved with the home around the time the abuse took place."	An appeal has been launched after two boys were sexually abused at a former care home.
Bernard Mensah struck a post for Aldershot after 11 minutes, but the visitors were a man down midway through the first half when Jim Kellerman saw red for a foul on Ross Stearn. The Shots regrouped and took a deserved lead in the 42nd minute when Idris Kanu latched on to a through pass and poked the ball under Ryan Clarke. But in the second half Eastleigh's extra man began to tell as they pushed forward and, with 10 minutes left, McAllister fired home from close range after getting on to the end of a flick-on. That was enough to earn Eastleigh their first point in five outings, while Aldershot extended their unbeaten run to 10 games. Report supplied by the Press Association.

Spireites midfielder Gary Liddle was sent off after only 16 minutes for a foul on Kane Vincent-Young. Chesterfield kept the U's out until Drew Wright broke free with 20 minutes remaining, cutting the ball back for Bonne to strike right-footed. However, three minutes later Lee Novak converted from the spot after he was felled by Richard Brindley. Colchester's winless run in League One stretched to 17 matches as they remain rooted to the foot of the table while a point was enough to take Chesterfield out of the relegation places.	Macauley Bonne scored his first goal in 11 games but Colchester were held to a draw by 10-man Chesterfield.
Met Police barrister Richard Horwell QC said suspects Dmitry Kovtun and Andrei Lugovoi had no personal motive to kill. The Russian state "is likely to have been the sponsor of this plot" and had "reasons aplenty" for wishing him "not only harm, but death", he said. UK officials believe the two suspects poisoned Mr Litvinenko, 43, in London in 2006 but they deny any wrongdoing. Mr Litvinenko drank tea containing a fatal dose of radioactive substance polonium-210 during a meeting with Mr Kovtun and Mr Lugovoi. He died in hospital nearly three weeks later. The fact that polonium caused his death indicates there was some form of Russian state participation, Mr Horwell said in his closing remarks. He said: "The evidence suggests the only credible explanation is that in one form or another the Russian state was involved in Mr Litvinenko's murder." However, he stressed this did not mean Russian President Vladimir Putin was involved or gave the order and that there were many possible motives for the murder. Defecting to the UK in 2000, after accusing KGB successor the FSB of murdering political opponents and of corruption, could have been seen as "akin to treachery", he said. He also spoke of Mr Litvinenko's "many personal attacks on Putin". Mr Horwell has said the risk to the general public in London from polonium radiation will never be known, and also that Mr Litvinenko had been poisoned twice in the run-up to his death. He said: "The two attacks on Mr Litvinenko were an outrage. They led to great suffering on his part and eventually to his demise. "We will never know how dangerous the exposure of polonium to the public at large will be and what long-term effects will be visited upon Londoners." Mr Horwell said the suspects left a "trail of polonium" behind and they had "no credible answer" to the scientific evidence against them. While the force wanted them tried for murder, this was now unlikely to happen, the inquiry heard. Attempts to extradite the two men have failed and they remain in Russia. Former Soviet army officer Mr Kovtun has been criticised by inquiry chairman Sir Robert Owen for failing to give evidence to the hearing. The inquiry was adjourned until Friday.	The Russian state wanted former spy Alexander Litvinenko dead, the inquiry into his poisoning has been told.
18 November 2015 Last updated at 15:00 GMT Det Ch Supt David Sandall said it was proving an "extremely traumatic time for her parents" and they are now treating the disappearance of the 15-year-old, from Measham, as murder. The teenager has not been seen since about 18:00 GMT on Friday when she was dropped off outside Ibstock Community College. Two men, aged 27 and 28, who were arrested on Monday on suspicion of kidnap have been re-arrested on suspicion of murder. More updates on this and other stories from Leicestershire.	The police officer leading the search for missing Leicestershire teenager Kayleigh Haywood has told her family to prepare themselves for the worst.
At least 90% of final year students at Cardiff, Swansea and Bangor said they were happy with their university experience. Aberystwyth and Cardiff Metropolitan both scored 83% in the 11th National Student Survey. Elsewhere, Glyndwr scored 80% while University of South Wales and Trinity St David both had 79% satisfaction. More than 300,000 people were surveyed at universities and colleges around the UK were asked about a wide range of subjects. The results shows overall satisfaction has remained steady, and there were particular gains in the areas of learning resources and satisfaction with the students' union. There have also been improvements in teaching, assessment and feedback, academic support, organisation and management, personal development and NHS practice placements. In all categories relating to the academic student experience, satisfaction has either improved or stayed the same since 2014. Dr David Blaney, chief executive of Higher Education Funding Council for Wales, said: "The strong performance of the Welsh HE [higher education] sector reflects the continuing work to enhance the student experience and provide students with an excellent learning environment.	Three Welsh universities are among the top places in the UK for student satisfaction, a new survey shows.
In 2014, a report by the public protector said Mr Zuma had "benefited unduly" from the upgrades. Mr Zuma said the auditor-general and finance minister should determine how much he should repay to end the dispute. The announcement comes a week before a constitutional hearing on the matter. Africa Live: BBC news updates How President Zuma's Nkandla home has grown The refurbishment of the residence in the village of Nkandla, in Mr Zuma's home province of KwaZulu-Natal, has turned into a major political controversy in South Africa. Some of of the money was spent on building an amphitheatre, swimming pool, and cattle enclosure. The opposition Democratic Alliance (DA) and Julius Malema's Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), who have called for a corruption investigation, say they are pressing ahead with their court case regardless of the president's latest offer. Following Mr Zuma's announcement #PayBackThemoney is trending in South Africa - this was the phrase EFF MPs chanted at the president in parliament last year. Many commentators seem sceptical. Analysis: Milton Nkosi, BBC News President Jacob Zuma's delayed willingness to pay back the money spent on the upgrades to his Nkandla residence could be a calculated move to avoid embarrassment at the Constitutional Court hearing expected next week. But it could also be linked to the forthcoming local government election. The Nkandla scandal has been a sore point for the governing African National Congress (ANC) which President Zuma leads, especially as the party faithful go out to campaign for votes. Political analyst Professor Somadoda Fikeni told me that it could also be related to the president being "politically vulnerable as he enters his 'lame-duck' period and following his mis-appointment of finance ministers" at the end of last year. Another consideration could well be an attempt to avert another episode of the chaotic scenes we saw during the opening of parliament last year when Julius Malema's Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) heckled and disrupted the president's state of the nation address. Security personnel had to be called into the chamber to remove the MPs who would not stop shouting "pay back the money'" while President Zuma desperately tried to deliver his speech. Punches at South Africa parliament Why did Zuma sack two finance ministers in a week? All figures in 2013 financial terms Source: Public protector report	South Africa's President Jacob Zuma has agreed to repay some of the $23m (£15m) the government controversially spent on upgrading his private rural home.
Clinical trials are the key to getting that data - and without volunteers to take part in the trials, there would be no new treatments for serious diseases such as cancer, multiple sclerosis and arthritis. But one disastrous drug trial at a London hospital in 2006 threatened to derail that system. In what became known as the Elephant Man trial, six healthy young men were treated for organ failure after experiencing a serious reaction within hours of taking the drug TGN1412 in a clinical trial. Big rise in medical trial volunteers After they were all admitted to intensive care, two became critically ill, the worst affected lost his fingers and toes, and all the men were subsequently told they would be likely to develop cancers or auto-immune diseases as a result of their exposure to the drug. In follow-up interviews, the men described feeling like their brains were "on fire" and their "eyeballs were going to pop out". Experts queued up to say the outcome of the trial had been unprecedented and exceptional, but could it happen again? Prof David Webb, professor of therapeutics and clinical pharmacology at the University of Edinburgh and vice president of the British Pharmacological Society, says it is "much less likely to happen again". He says things have changed for the better since 2006, following a number of recommendations made in the Duff Report, written in response to the trial. "The MHRA [Medicines and Health products Regulatory Agency] now ensures committees look at pre-clinical data, to decide whether the first dose given to humans is the right dose and has rules for stopping if things don't go as expected." Before a drug is tested on humans, it goes through laboratory and animal testing.  Medicines are also tested for toxicity before being given to people. Then there are four stages of drug testing in humans. Phase I - studies, on a small number of healthy volunteers, to understand what effects a new medicine has on human subjects - what happens to the compound in the body from the time it is swallowed or injected until it is excreted. Study participants are monitored for side effects. Phase II - designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a drug in patients who are at the same stage of a specific disease or condition. They are given various doses of a compound and closely monitored. Phase III - used to confirm a new drug's safety and efficacy, while working out the best dosage regimen. Studies are carried out in large numbers of patients with a specific disease or condition. Safety and efficacy is compared to the currently accepted standard treatment. Phase IV - these studies take place after the drug has been approved for marketing. They evaluate the long-term effects of the drug in larger numbers of patients, sub-populations of patients. Less common adverse events may be detected. MHRA This is particularly important when trials involve drugs that affect the immune system, he says. But is it possible to eliminate the risks entirely? "You can mitigate against the risks, but nothing is 100% certain. We can never be sure," Prof Webb says. The trial, which was privately run at a research facility at Northwick Park Hospital in north London, involved the first testing of a new drug on humans. This is the initial phase in assessing the safety of a drug before moving onto larger-scales studies in patients themselves. The report said Parexel, the company managing the trial, had been unclear about a safe dose to start testing on humans and it should have tested the drug on one person at a time. The MHRA, which regulates clinical trials and medicines in the UK, and which was criticised at the time for giving the green light to the TGN1412 trial, says the conduct on these phase-one trials "has moved on significantly". "Additional provisions and guidance has been put in place for certain novel products to provide as much assurance on safety as possible," the agency says. It adds that it has simplified and streamlined the regulation of clinical trials and collaborated with other bodies and experts to collect as much information as possible on risk factors before a trial is authorised. Phase-one trials, when drugs are tested on humans for the first time, only happen after extensive testing on tissue samples and animals in the lab. Getting this stage right before moving onto research in humans is crucial. Dr Catherine Elliott, director of clinical research interests at the Medical Research Council, which funds clinical trials in the UK and globally, says there is a move to refine the models used at the pre-clinical stage. "Animal models are the mainstay, but we are trying to develop other models too to have more tailored disease models." She says researchers are making use of brain imaging to understand the mechanisms of illness in humans and using IT to predict the effects of new drugs. Testing on animals, which has its own controversies, can get scientists so far - but someone always has to be the first person to test a new medicine. The volunteers for phase-one clinical tests always have to be healthy young men because of the risk to a woman's eggs or foetus. Prof Webb says we are indebted to the 50 to 100 people in the UK each year who step forward to begin the testing of every new drug. "There are so many effective medicines for cancer, heart disease et cetera - and they all come from volunteers who have taken part in small, early studies." He believes that everyone who wants to should be able to register themselves available for clinical research through their GP. "I would argue that everyone should be a volunteer. We'd get the payback eventually because by the time we're in our 60s and 70s most of us will end up on medicines." Although volunteers are compensated for their time and inconvenience during the trial, they are not paid for taking part - and Dr Elliott says this is the correct approach. "There shouldn't be an incentive to do something they wouldn't otherwise do. It shouldn't be related to risk. People have to be able to give free consent." Despite all this, there appears to have been no reduction in interest in participating in early-stage trials since Northwick Park. The MHRA says the number of UK clinical trial authorisation applications has been fairly stable at 900-1,000 per year since May 2004. Prof Webb says he has always found it relatively easy to find volunteers for the "first in man" trials he oversees at his approved research centre in Edinburgh. The MHRA is in no doubt about the safety of drug trials, seven years on from Northwick Park. A representative said: "Clinical trials in the UK have an excellent safety record and they play a vital role in the development of new medicines, providing evidence so that clinicians can make informed prescribing decisions. "Safety problems associated with clinical trials are rare and the risk of a repeat of the incident in 2006 concerning the TGN1412 drug is extremely low."	Before any new medicine can be given to patients, detailed information about how it works and how safe it is must be collected.
Lyndon Gooch's long-range dipping effort caused Fleetwood keeper Chris Maxwell to make a fingertip save. Amari'i Bell fired into the side-netting for the hosts, while Richard Chaplow scuffed a chance for Rovers. Jimmy Ryan's 25-yard effort almost won the game for the hosts but the ball struck the crossbar.	Fleetwood Town dropped into the League One relegation places as they had to settle for a point after a stalemate with Doncaster.
The former London Irish man, 29, who can play in the second or back row, was injured in Friday's loss at Newcastle. "He really hurt his neck and he has got pins and needles in his arms and through his hands," director of rugby Todd Blackadder told BBC Points West. "So he could be out for a little while yet but it's hopefully not too serious. But to lose a big boy like that is an opportunity for someone else."	Bath forward Matt Garvey is to have surgery after sustaining a neck injury.
Opponents fear the development on the site in Hermitage Lane, Allington, will destroy ancient woodland and cause traffic gridlock. Developer Croudace Homes said the number of homes had been reduced from 600 and efforts made to cut the impact on the woodland of building a new road. The public inquiry in Maidstone is expected to last until 10 June. Barbara Woodward, from the New Allington Action Group (NAAG), said: "People are very upset. This is our last piece of green land. "We take our dogs for a walk in the woods, you can let them off their leads. If they build a road across the woods it will no longer be safe." She added that the inquiry was the "last step" to protect the woodland which she said had been on the site since the 14th Century. Councillor Fran Wilson, the Lib Dem leader of the borough council, said it would be "inappropriate" for the authority to comment at this stage. Following the public inquiry a recommendation will be made to the Secretary of State who will make a decision on the planning application.	An public inquiry is under way into plans for up to 500 new homes in an area of open land in Kent.
Mr Rouhani is expected to secure valuable trade deals following the lifting of international sanctions over Iran's nuclear programme. Among them is a likely agreement with French aircraft manufacturer Airbus for more than 100 new aircraft. Mr Rouhani will also meet French President Francois Hollande. Mr Rouhani's five-day visit to Italy and France is the first by an Iranian president in nearly two decades, as the Iranian president seeks to rebuild economic ties and secure new trade deals. Iran is likely to need hundreds of new aircraft in the coming years as it re-establishes commercial air travel restricted by the sanctions, and French carmakers will once again be free to supply to the Islamic Republic. As well as a deal for Airbus planes, contracts are likely to be signed with car manufacturers Peugeot and Renault, Mr Rouhani told reporters on Monday. In Italy, Mr Rouhani met with President Matteo Renzi and Pope Francis. Monday saw contracts worth around €17bn ($18.4bn; £12bn) signed between Iranian and Italian companies. At Rome's Capitoline Museum, where Mr Rouhani and Mr Renzi met, nude statues were covered up and wine was removed from official menus out of respect for the Islamic Republic's strict laws governing propriety. Iranian diplomats reportedly requested that no wine be served at Mr Rouhani's lunch meeting with Mr Hollande, leading French officials to postpone the meeting until after lunch. During their meeting, Pope Francis urged Iran to work with other Middle Eastern countries against terrorism and arms trafficking, the Vatican said. Iran has been accused of funding militant groups, such as Hezbollah in Lebanon. Mr Rouhani asked the pontiff to pray for him, and gave him the gift of a hand-made carpet.	Iranian president Hassan Rouhani will arrive in France on Wednesday for the second leg of his state visit to Europe, after three days in Italy.
The ex-Bury and Sheffield United player was abused while at Crewe Alexandra from the age of 11 to 15. His abuser, Barry Bennell, was jailed for nine years in 1998 after admitting sexual offences against six boys. Warnock said Mr Woodward gave other alleged victims the courage to speak. Mr Woodward, was the first to go public last week, and has since been followed by several others who have made allegations about being sexually abused by coaches as children. Cheshire Police said 11 people had come forward after Mr Woodward waived his anonymity, including his fellow ex-Crewe player Steve Walters, 44, who said he had been abused by Bennell, when he was 13 or 14, during a trip to Anglesey. A dedicated NSPCC hotline - 0800 023 2642 - set up after the abuse claims came to light, received more than 50 calls within its first two hours. Abuse claims: Who has spoken out? Football abused 'could number hundreds' We must protect next generation - FA chief Warnock said he had spoken to Mr Woodward before he went public. ''I had an hour with him on the phone and in that conversation he broke down in tears because it's horrific,'' the Cardiff manager said. ''It's alright saying it's a long time ago but to actually confront it in the media takes so much guts. ''I've told him how proud I am of him and I think by his bravery it will open up everything now and it will be a relief for so many ex-players that have been through the same situation.'' He added: ''I wasn't aware how bad it was at the time when I helped him. He was at Bury and I thought he was outstanding so I'd promised to take him with me when I went to Sheffield United. ''But then he just lost his form overnight with no real reason, until he spoke to me. I felt I had to carry on and take him because I'd given him my word. ''When you listen to his story and when I look back now, I couldn't understand it at the time and I don't think any of us could ever envisage what Andy and the other lads have had to go through. ''I think it becomes easier now. Now it's out in the open I think they can get on with their lives and I think Andy will help a lot of people. He's that type of person who will talk to those who want privacy and help them. ''It's a good thing he's set in motion because I think what Andy brought out is the tip of the iceberg and we'll see that in the coming months.'' Warnock said measures had been put in place in recent years regarding checks on young players' coaches and there was now support for those who need it. He said: ''I think there has to be changes but we have everything in place, financially and everything, we have no excuse to let young lads down now. ''The helplines they are setting up at every level, if a parent's worried, there's help there. It has to be, not just the professionals, but the Sunday Leagues."	Cardiff City manager Neil Warnock has praised the bravery of his former player Andy Woodward for speaking out about being sexually abused by a coach as a child.
A statement says to meet the criteria for the revamped 2014 Super League they had to establish a partnership with a men's club or similar institution. It is the chairman's belief that by incorporating the ladies' team with the men's team, we can develop a one-club mentality The club say the shared chairmanship of Ray Trew will bring "mutual gain". "The players will have access to the kind of facilities and resources the Notts squad have," the statement read. "This was another key driving factor. Together with the benefits for the playing staff, there are numerous off-field advantages also, with the ladies' side able to tap into the well-established commercial, media and marketing facilities available at Notts County." Many Lincoln Ladies supporters were angered by the move, which will see the club playing their home games around 35 miles away from their current temporary home at Lincoln City's Sincil Bank. The Lady Imps, who had an application to relocate blocked by the FA Women's Super League in 2012, say they understand fans' concerns and "are working closely with organisations in both Nottingham and Lincoln to ensure that following the club in our new home will be as easy and affordable as possible". The statement added: "It is the chairman's belief that by incorporating the ladies' team with the men's team, we can develop a one-club mentality that will benefit both sides and aid growth of the combined brand." Lady Imps player Megan Harris told BBC Lincolnshire: "It's a really tough situation. I have been with Lincoln since the very beginning so it is hard to see something that I have been part of move. "But obviously I work for the club as well and can see behind the scenes and what's going on and how the women's game is progressing. It is turning into much more of a business now and money is starting to talk. "Liverpool are sitting top of the Super League because they had a massive cash injection and the men's team are backing them. If you want to compete at the highest level then that's what you have to do."	Lincoln Ladies have insisted their controversial relocation to Nottingham and decision to play as Notts County next season was their only option.
Christopher Clarke, 29, contacted girls, aged 15 and 16 at the time, via Facebook, Snapchat and Twitter. He also bought the Ysgol Bro Dinefwr pupils gifts including T-shirts, earrings, sweets and games consoles. An Education Workforce Council hearing concluded his actions amounted to professional misconduct. One girl told how Mr Clarke sent her a message saying: "I kept having the same thought over and over again. How much I wanted to grab you, kiss you..." The girl, now 19, said he also invited her to one-on-one sessions in his chemistry office and told her not to show anyone the gifts her gave her. Another girl, now 17, said his actions made her feel uncomfortable and he was "acting in a creepy nature". A third student said she told Mr Clarke she thought his messages were inappropriate and he later asked her to delete their conversation. Police investigated but no charges were brought against Mr Clarke. The school also began an investigation but he resigned before any findings were made. Education Workforce Council chairman, Steve Powell, said Mr Clarke's conduct "clearly breached boundaries between teachers and pupils". "His actions fell very short of the standards expected of a registered person and amounted to unacceptable professional conduct," he added.	A Carmarthenshire teacher who sent thousands of sexual messages to three pupils has been banned from teaching for five years.
The RNLI says six crew members have been brought in from the UK to staff the St Helier station in Jersey. The charity said the decision to remove coxswain Andy Hibbs was made due to a "serious risk to its ability to run a safe and effective lifesaving service". Mr Hibbs denies the claim he broke the volunteers' code of conduct. More on St Helier lifeboat and other Channel Island stories here The St Helier station was unmanned for the weekend and members of the public attended a silent protest on Sunday. The charity says the new crew members have come from various parts of the UK, and will remain until the dispute is resolved.	A lifeboat station is back in service, four days after 25 volunteers resigned in protest against the sacking of a senior crew member.
It comes as a documentary, The Betrayed Girls is being shown on BBC One about nine Asian men jailed for grooming teenage girls in the town in 2012. Laura, who was abused by the gang from the age of 13 until she was 17, said the targeting of girls by Asian men was still going on in Greater Manchester. Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said it was "committed" to tackling abusers. Laura, whose identity is protected as a victim of a sex crime, told BBC Two's Victoria Derbyshire show said she was walking in Oldham town centre through an Asian community a couple of months ago. "I was still getting cars pulling over to me asking me if I wanted to go for a drink," said Laura. "It's not bothering them. I don't actually think they understand that they are doing something wrong." Nazir Afzal the north west's former chief crown prosecutor who brought the case against the Rochdale gang said five years on some victims nationally are still not being listened to. Mr Afzal overturned a decision not to charge nine men who ran the child sex exploitation ring. He said there have been "significant rises" in investigations and prosecutions into the crime and victims were more confident in reporting abuse and they are getting better support. However, he said: "Victim support groups nationally are still telling me victims are not being consistently listened to and told the case is too difficult to bring [to court]." He also said some victims of historical child sex exploitation were being told that police were focusing on current cases, too. Mr Afzal said agencies must be more proactive and more "collaborative working" was needed between the police, councils and other agencies and voluntary groups. GMP said it was "vital" they learnt the lessons from the past and it was "absolutely committed" to working with partners across Greater Manchester to tackle the sexual exploitation of children and young people. "We have been working tirelessly for many years to prevent this abhorrent crime from happening and provide support to victims and their families." Rochdale Council said public services "collectively failed" the victims but lessons have "been learnt from it". Steve Rumbelow, chief executive of Rochdale Borough Council, said: "Since 2012 the council and its partners have worked to make the changes needed, to increase knowledge, prevent harm, challenge those who wish to exploit children and better support victims and survivors." The documentary which features testimonies from victims for the first time follows a BBC One drama Three Girls.

7 January 2016 Last updated at 16:05 GMT One part of the country badly hit was Lancashire, where water sports fans found that it was even deep enough to jet-ski and canoe close to a bus stop. The video has gone viral, with more than 1,300 shares and 114,000 views on social media. Remember floods are dangerous, and you should never go into flood water. Never try anything like this.	December was the UK's wettest month in more than a hundred years.
The 58-year-old, who will leave his England post, has managed Bournemouth, Doncaster Rovers, Crawley Town, Nottingham Forest and Bristol City. Reds academy coach Pep Lijnders joins the first-team staff, with talks continuing over a third new coach. Manager Brendan Rodgers needed replacements after the sackings of Colin Pascoe and Mike Marsh. He said: "I have made these appointments because I want to take us in a new technical direction, in terms of coaching. "I believe the entire first-team set-up will benefit and I am extremely positive and excited about what we can achieve, as a group, going forward. "My admiration for Sean, as a professional, is well documented. He is someone with a clear vision and philosophy and has proved he has the ability to transfer that knowledge, through his coaching, to the players." O'Driscoll, who had only been England Under-19s head coach since September, added: "I am excited to be joining one of the world's most iconic football clubs. "The hallmark of any successful club is its culture and that comes from the people who work there, from the chief executive and first-team manager to those people behind the scenes whose faces may not be known but who are the lifeblood of the club." The majority of Liverpool's players have reported back for pre-season training to be greeted by the revamped management team - put in place after an end-of-season review between Rodgers and owners Fenway Sports Group following a disappointing season in which Liverpool faded to finish sixth. Rodgers became the first Reds boss since the 1950s to fail to win a trophy in his first three seasons and, after a 6-1 thrashing at Stoke on the last day of the season, accepted his position was under threat. Liverpool are also expected to appoint another new face to the coaching set-up before the start of the season as Lijnders is likely to be involved in elite player development and will continue to oversee some top academy players rather than acting as a direct replacement for Marsh.	Liverpool have named England Under-19s boss Sean O'Driscoll as their new assistant manager.
Atkinson, who can also play in midfield, has made 20 appearances for the Magpies since signing in July 2015, following his release by West Brom. The 22-year-old has yet to play in a League Two game this season, but has featured twice in cup competitions. He could make his debut for the Heed when they travel to face struggling Guiseley on 25 October. Meanwhile, on-loan Carlisle midfielder Russell Penn, 30, has extended his loan stay with Gateshead until 26 December.	National League side Gateshead have signed versatile Notts County defender Wes Atkinson on a one-month loan deal.
Hearts' majority shareholder Ann Budge hopes fans can drive this income via continued pledges to the Foundation of Hearts (FOH) and support of the club. The transfer of Budge's shares to FOH would be delayed under the proposal. "If contributions continued at today's levels, majority ownership would pass to FOH only eight months later than originally envisaged," said Budge. "However, they would be taking over a club with everything in place to ensure financial stability and to position the club for continued growth. "It is worth noting that, should the number of pledgers increase over this period, the original five-year plan could still be achieved." Supporters and the club's on-field success, securing a third-place finish in the Scottish Premiership, form half of the £6m reserve, with the remaining £3m stemming from benefactor and commercial contributions respectively. Budge has asked the Foundation of Hearts to postpone repayment of her loan for two years in the hope of raising the £3m for the main stand project during that period - current monthly income stands at £125,000. Hearts also hope to raise £3m via a debenture scheme, which will soon be announced. Budge has, in addition, offered to transfer 20% of her shares once £1.5m has been raised towards the stand and another 15% when the target is reached. Her remaining 40% stake would be handed over when her £2.5m loan is repaid. She has also offered to waive interest payments on her loan during the two-year period. "This would effectively be my personal contribution of £300,000 to the main stand fund," she said.	Hearts are looking to double a £6m fund to cover the estimated cost of building a new main stand at Tynecastle.
While its existence has become a source of controversy on both sides of the Channel, some are also angry at attempts to destroy it.	Demolition teams - backed up by riot police - are dismantling parts of the migrant camp in Calais, known as the Jungle, which has become home to thousands of people desperate to reach Britain.
Scientists have struggled to explain the so-called pause that began in 1999, despite ever increasing levels of CO2 in the atmosphere. The latest theory says that a naturally occurring 30-year cycle in the Atlantic Ocean is behind the slowdown. The researchers says this slow-moving current could continue to divert heat into the deep seas for another decade. However, they caution that global temperatures are likely to increase rapidly when the cycle flips to a warmer phase. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), global average temperatures have increased by around 0.05C per decade in the period between 1998 and 2012. This compares with a decadal average of 0.12 between 1951 and 2012. More than a dozen theories have been put forward on the cause of this pause in temperature growth that occurred while emissions of carbon dioxide were at record highs. These ideas include the impact of pollution such as soot particles that have reflected back some of the Sun's heat into space. Increased volcanic activity since 2000 has also been blamed, as have variations in solar activity. The most recent perspectives have looked to the oceans as the locations of the missing heat. Last year a study suggested that a periodic upwelling of cooler waters in the Pacific was limiting the rise. However this latest work, published in the journal Science, shifts the focus from the Pacific to the Atlantic and Southern oceans. The team, lead by Prof Ka-Kit Tung from the University of Washington, US, says there is now evidence that a 30-year current alternately warms and cools the world by sinking large amounts of heat beneath these deep waters. They've used observations from a network of devices called Argo floats that sample the oceans down to 2,000 metres. The researchers say that there was another hiatus between 1945 and 1975 due to this current taking down the heat, that led to fears of a new ice age. From 1976 though, the cycle flipped and contributed to the warming of the world, as more heat stayed on the surface. But since the year 2000, the heat has been going deeper, and the world's overall temperatures haven't risen beyond the record set in 1998. "The floats have been very revealing to us," said Prof Tung. "I think the consensus at this point is that below 700 metres in the Atlantic and Southern oceans [they are] storing heat and not the Pacific." A key element in this new understanding is the saltiness of the water. The waters in the Atlantic current coming up from the tropics are saltier because of evaporation. This sinks more quickly and takes the heat down with it. Eventually though, the salty water melts enough ice in Arctic waters to lower the saline level, slowing down the current and keeping the heat near the surface. "Before 2006 the saltiness was increasing, this indicated that the current was speeding up," said Prof Tung. "After 2006, this saltiness is diminishing but it's still above the long-term average. Now it is slowly slowing down. "Once it gets below the long-term average, then it is the next period of rapid warming." As well as the data from the Argo floats, Prof Tung has also examined the Central England Temperature record, that dates back over 350 years. He believes that this confirms the regular 70-year cycles of warm and cold spells. This historic pattern, he says, could extend the current period of pause. "We probably may have another 10 years, maybe shorter as global warming itself is melting more ice and ice could flood the North Atlantic, but historically we are in the middle of the cycle." Several other researchers in this field acknowledge the Tung analysis is part of a growing body of evidence that suggests the Atlantic has a role in the pause. Prof Reto Knutti from the ETH Zurich has recently published a review of all the current theories on the hiatus. "I see the studies as complementary, and they both highlight that natural variability in ocean and atmosphere is important in modifying long term anthropogenic trends," he said. "A better understanding of those modes of variability is critical to understand past changes (including differences between models and observations during the hiatus period) as well as predicting the future, in particular in the near term and regionally, where variability dominates the forced changes from greenhouses gases." Other scientists say that the Atlantic hypothesis is interesting but a much longer range of observations is needed. "We really don't have a lot of data," said Dr Jonathan Robson from the University of Reading, UK. "So if there is this 60-year oscillation in the ocean, we haven't observed it all, basically we've observed the impact of it. We may have to wait 15-20 years to know what's going on." Prof Tung believes that whatever the cause and the length of the pause, we are on a "rising staircase" when it comes to global temperatures that will become apparent when the Atlantic current switches again. "At the end we will be on the rising part of the staircase, and the rate of warming there will be very fast, just as fast as the last three decades of the 20th Century, plus we are starting off at a higher plateau. The temperatures and the effects will be more severe." Follow Matt on Twitter.	The hiatus in the rise in global temperatures could last for another 10 years, according to new research.
The chancellor did, however, confirm a Â£50m pot of money to support the expansion of grammar schools. He said the government's education policies had "expanded opportunity". But head teachers said capital investment in grammar schools was "the wrong priority". Mr Hammond told MPs on Wednesday: "The government's education reforms have raised standards and expanded opportunity, with 1.4 million more children now in 'good' or 'outstanding' schools. "And the new capital funding I have provided today for grammar schools will help to continue that trend." Responding to the statement, Malcolm Trobe, interim general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: "It is disappointing that the Autumn Statement failed to address the severe funding pressures in schools and colleges. "The situation is so serious that some are struggling to deliver a full curriculum, courses are having to be cut and some sixth-forms are closing. "Education is arguably the single most important investment we can make. "It provides the country's intellectual infrastructure, the knowledge and skills which will enable us to remain competitive in a global market." Russell Hobby, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teacher,  also expressed his disappointment the government had failed to use the Autumn Statement to invest in education. "We know that school budgets are being pushed beyond breaking point," he said. "Almost nine out of 10 school leaders are telling us that a rise in national insurance employer contributions and pension contributions are the key reasons behind financial pressures in their school. "Freezing budgets at a time of rising costs is no protection at all. "The government has the levers to address rising costs, but has again failed to pull them. "Social mobility has rightly become a focus for the government. "And yet, without investment in what works - quality early years education, high quality teachers and the right funding delivered directly to schools - it is hard to see how the rhetoric can match the reality. "Capital investment in grammar schools is the wrong priority, and a distraction from the most important issues in education." Last month, a group of head teachers wrote to Downing Street  to express concern about increased funding pressures. Plans to allow grammar schools to expand were first announced in September by Prime Minister Theresa May, who said that selective schools could help the life chances of poor pupils. Mrs May said that under the current system there was "selection by stealth", based on parents' wealth and ability to buy houses near the best schools. A consultation on the proposals is due to close next month.	Head teachers say it is "disappointing" that Chancellor Philip Hammond's Autumn Statement failed to address funding pressures faced by many schools and colleges across England.
Mark King, 21, earlier admitted stabbing 37-year-old Steven Downes in the Dennistoun area of Glasgow at 01:30 on 17 January 2015. He was told he would also be supervised for three years after his release. King is already serving four-and-a-half years for another stabbing carried out in July 2015 while he was on bail. For that offence he was also ordered to be supervised in the community for two years following his release. The court heard that in the January attack, Mr Downes had been stabbed in the back, face, arm and side and had suffered a punctured lung. Judge Lord Clark highlighted the "pattern of knife-carrying" King was developing and told him a substantial prison term was the only appropriate sentence. King was assessed as being at "maximum risk" of re-offending or causing harm to the public. During his evidence, Mr Downes said he had asked King and his friends in the close to keep the noise down because his children were sleeping. King, who was armed with a knife, ran up the stairs towards him. Mr Downes said: "I think I got stabbed when I got dragged out of my house with my jumper over my head. "A group were kicking my door open and bottles were getting flung. "I blacked out and ended up in the Western Infirmary suffering from a punctured lung." Passing sentence at the High Court in Livingston, Lord Clark told King he had been convicted of assaulting Mr Downes to his severe injury to the danger of his life and of attempting to murder him. "You tried to force entry to Steven Downes' flat. The door was kicked open and Steven Downes was dragged out of the flat and struck on the head and stabbed," he said. "He had a stab wound to his back, stab wounds to his face and arm and a stab wound to the left side resulting in a collapsed lung and bleeding into his chest cavity. "The injury to his left arm required to be stapled, the injury to his back was life-threatening and other injuries have resulted in permanent scarring." He added:  "Your repeated involvement in offences involving knives is a very serious matter. "The report notes you are beginning to develop a pattern of knife-carrying which is assessed as representing an increased risk to local communities. "I see no alternative to a substantial custodial sentence." He warned King that any breach of the licence conditions could see him taken back to prison to serve the remainder of his sentence. Matt Jackson, defending, revealed his client had been convicted of assault to severe injury and danger of life, along with other offences, and was on High Court bail when he committed the crimes. Mr Jackson said King had been "a young lad with terrific prospects" before he turned to offending while out of work. "Every once in a while in one's professional career one encounters an individual [whom] its baffling to understand how he's involved in and is convicted of these very serious offences.	A man has been jailed for 10 years for the attempted murder of a father who had asked him to keep the noise down in a common close of his flat.
These are two of the questions up for debate at a new exhibition at the National Library of Wales, Aberystwyth. From ancient Brythonic warlord to mythical chivalric king with a court anywhere from Wales to Glastonbury or as far north as Scotland - it is hard to separate myth, legend and fact. According to curator Dr Maredudd ap Huw, these unknowns lie at the heart of King Arthur's enduring appeal. "The beauty of Arthur is that he was - indeed, according to some 'is' - whoever you want him to be," said Dr ap Huw. "There is some early evidence to suggest that there was an Arthur in the 4th or 5th Centuries. "Though in all likelihood he was very far removed from the romantic depictions of (writers) Thomas Malory and Alfred, Lord Tennyson." However, just how Welsh he would have been is a "moot point", Dr ap Huw added. Before the Saxons drove the Brythonic people (Celtic Britons) west and north, there was no recognised entity of an independent Wales, making his nationality hard to ascertain. The exhibition brings together all the crucial texts which have informed our perception of Arthur for more than a millennium. One of the exhibits is the 13th Century Book of Aneirin, which includes a 6th Century poem describing a battle near what is now Catterick in North Yorkshire. Dr ap Huw said one reference in it is extremely telling. A young Brythonic hero called Gwawrddur is described as fighting valiantly against the Saxons "although he was no Arthur". "It is possible to infer (from this) that the legend of Arthur as a fearsome warlord was already well-established by the 6th Century," Dr ap Huw added. But the man who drew all the threads together and introduced Arthur's wife Guinevere, his sword Excalibur and the Knights of the Round Table was Geoffrey of Monmouth. Dr ap Huw describes the 12th Century writer as "the most influential author in the history of Wales". "Forget Dylan Thomas, what Geoffrey wrote had a far more profound impact on world thinking and the perception of Arthur as a Welsh hero," he said. "Writing in Latin, his ideas rapidly spread throughout Europe, and via Chretien De Troyes, fed into the French-Norman ideals of chivalric kingship. "Geoffrey claimed as his source an ancient Welsh manuscript which was then lost, never to be found.  Read into that what you will, but what is certainly true to say is that it is still essentially Geoffrey's version of King Arthur which we are taught as children, right up to the present day." Arthur's castle Camelot and other characters such as the wizard Merlin are then referenced in the 13th Century Black Book of Carmarthen. There he is described as "a war veteran who has lost his wits in battle in Scotland, and has developed the gift of being able to talk to animals". But it was not until the 15th and 16th Century that "Arthur Mania" reached its heights after William Caxton published Thomas Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur. While Geoffrey of Monmouth set Camelot in the former Roman stronghold of Caerleon, near Newport, Malory anchored it as a thoroughly English tale. So much so that King Henry VII named his eldest son Arthur in honour of the legend. By 1534, Polydore Vergil's Anglica Historia had debunked much of Geoffrey of Monmouth's work, and cast doubt on the very existence of a historical Arthur at all. "Virgil's account wasn't wholly accepted. John Prise - a lawyer for Thomas Cromwell - published a rebuttal in defence of Arthur, but by then the historiographic interest in Arthur was already fatally damaged. "That's not to say we'd forgotten about him altogether. Edmund Spencer's Faerie Queene drew heavily on Arthurian tradition and, when it was presented to Queen Elizabeth I in 1590, she was so delighted that she awarded him a pension of Â£50 a year for life," Dr ap Huw said. "But by then Arthur had become a Britannia or Gloriana-type figurehead for a nation. "The historical Arthur was deadâ€¦though there are some who say he never died, and is simply waiting to wake again when his country needs him."	Who was King Arthur and how Welsh was he?
East Oxford residents have been complaining about the behaviour of Oxford Brookes students on nights out. In the letter Andrea Siret, head of community engagement, said students could face disciplinary action. One resident told the BBC he often heard students "screaming". Ross Clark said: "We've had students running over cars in our street, stupid things. "At two o'clock in the morning they're all running past in shopping trolleys, screaming. It isn't a good thing. "When you get terrible [neighbours] you're in trouble." The letter tells students to "show consideration to their neighbours, including students passing through residential areas to attend venues, as quite often residents are sleeping". It reads: "We are particularly concerned about the volume of complaints we have received... we believe that the majority of these complaints are caused by students on their way to or returning from a night out. "The university takes its responsibilities as a neighbour within the community very seriously. "All students at Oxford Brookes University accept, as a condition of enrolment, that they will not act in a way that brings the university into disrepute. This includes students living in private-rented accommodation." Oxford City Council has set Oxford's universities a target of no more than 3,000 students each living in private accommodation. However, 3,747 Oxford Brookes students rented private homes last year, with many residing in the east Oxford area.	"Extremely serious concerns about unacceptable noise and disruption" caused by students in Oxford have increased, according to a letter seen by the BBC.
The 45-year-old, who led Quins to the Premiership title in 2012, has been linked with the Italy head coach job. The club, which also won the Amlin Challenge Cup and the LV Cup under O'Shea, says it is searching for the Irishman's replacement. "The end of this season is the right time for me to move on," said O'Shea. "We have a very talented group of players and coaches who are intent on securing silverware this season. "That is my sole focus and where all our efforts are concentrated." O'Shea won 35 Ireland caps between 1993 and 2000, spending 10 years at London Irish as a player and coach before taking over at Quins. He took the job in the aftermath of the 'Bloodgate' scandal that ended with Dean Richards resigning. "All of us at the club are of course disappointed that Conor will be leaving us at the end of this season," said Harlequins chief executive David Ellis. "Conor took over after a difficult period in our history. "Under his leadership and through his determination, energy and positive approach he has helped restore pride in our famous shirt and rejuvenate the playing style for which we are known. "On behalf of all of us associated with Harlequins, I would like to thank Conor for his tireless and selfless commitment over the last six years, guiding us through our most successful period on the field. "Conor will leave the club in a significantly better place than he found us and for that we are all grateful to him." Quins are third in the Premiership table, six points behind leaders Saracens. "O'Shea has done a magnificent job at Harlequins, dragging the club from the low of the 'Bloodgate' saga and turning them into Premiership champions in 2012. "Under his tutelage Quins have also provided a host of England internationals, and at one point fielded a whole XV of England-qualified players. "With his contract up at the end of the season, O'Shea clearly feels ready for a new challenge, and has had discussions about replacing Jacques Brunel as Italy's head coach. "As for his successor, the former England boss Stuart Lancaster could possibly fit the bill as a like-for-like replacement."	Harlequins director of rugby Conor O'Shea will leave The Stoop when his contract expires at the end of the season after six years in charge.
Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe - a charity worker accused of security offences - was detained while trying to leave the country with her baby daughter after visiting relatives in April 2016. Her family denies she broke any laws. Her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, who is from London, said his wife's detention was a "stain" on Iran. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, 38, who works for the charity the Thomson Reuters Foundation, has been detained in Iran since her arrest last year. The couple's two-year-old daughter has remained in Iran after the government confiscated her passport, and is being looked after by her grandparents. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's family said in September that a Revolutionary Court had handed down the five-year term. She was accused of allegedly plotting to topple the government in Tehran, but the official charges against her were not made public. According to Mr Ratcliffe, his wife's appeal was dismissed in a secret hearing of an Iranian Revolutionary Court on 4 January but only announced on 22 January. In a statement, her husband said the precise charges against her remain secret, but that two new accusations were made at her appeal. One was that she had been head of recruitment for the BBC's Farsi service when it was launched in 2009. Her family say she worked on a BBC training project for youth in Afghanistan and Iran, but never worked for BBC Farsi. The other charge was that she was married to a British spy. Mr Ratcliffe is an accountant. Monique Villa, chief executive of Thomson Reuters Foundation said she is "outraged by this new mockery of justice", and reiterated Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe never worked for BBC Farsi and that her husband "is not a spy but a reputable accountant". "I am fully convinced of Nazanin's innocence," she added. Francesca Unsworth, BBC World Service Group director, said Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe had briefly worked for charity BBC Media Action in a "junior administrative capacity" but had never worked for BBC Persian. "In any case, to suggest that being employed by BBC Persian is tantamount to 'acting against national security' is patently ludicrous," Ms Unsworth added. Mr Ratcliffe said: "The lack of justice in Nazanin's case continues to be a stain on Iran. The continued attempt to frame Nazanin behind secrets and lies brings shame. "It is a needless waste of a mother and child's life for their own political bargains and economic interests." Iran does not recognize dual nationalities, meaning those detained cannot receive consular assistance. Since her imprisonment, her family have campaigned on her behalf, highlighting her deteriorating health while in jail and her anguish at her separation from her daughter.	A court in Iran has rejected an appeal against a five-year prison sentence given to a woman with dual British and Iranian citizenship.
Core earnings fell 41% to $1.59bn (Â£1.03bn), with pre-tax profits down to $708m from $1.9bn a year earlier. Like many other energy companies, BG's results have been affected by the fall in oil prices from a year ago. BG said it was still happy with Shell's Â£47bn offer for the firm, despite a recent recovery in oil prices. "There is no change to our view on the offer," said BG chief executive Helge Lund. BG agreed to be bought by Royal Dutch Shell last month. Mr Lund said the deal was expected to be completed by early-2016. BG more than doubled production from its Brazil and Australia operations in the first quarter. However, the impact of the lower oil price from a year earlier was seen in a 21% fall in revenues to $3.99bn.	UK oil and gas exploration firm BG Group, which is set to be taken over by Royal Dutch Shell, has reported a big drop in first-quarter earnings.
Blair Turgott got on the end of a good passing move to secure victory in the dying minutes at Grange Lane. The Villagers' problem this season has not been creating chances but taking them, as when Steve Brogan curled in a shot from long range that clipped the bar. After the break, Reece Thompson eventually put the home side ahead with a great finish from Kyle Wootton's cross. However, Bromley substitute George Porter equalised swiftly from close range with his first touch of the match. Turgott's late winner left the bottom club quizzical about when their wretched luck will turn. Report supplied by the Press Association. Match ends, North Ferriby United 1, Bromley 2. Second Half ends, North Ferriby United 1, Bromley 2. Goal!  North Ferriby United 1, Bromley 2. Blair Turgott (Bromley). Substitution, North Ferriby United. Ryan Kendall replaces Reece Thompson.

The 20-year-old had been named in the Nigeria squad for the first time, having played at youth level and helped to win the 2013 Under-17 World Cup. Chelsea winger Victor Moses (hamstring) and Mainz defender Leon Balogun (muscular injury) are also out. Godwin Obaje, Chisom Egbuchulam and Uche Henry Agbo are their replacements. Success appeared to be in line to make his Super Eagles debut, particularly after he came off the bench to score for Watford and earn them a draw against Bournemouth on Saturday. But Nigeria Football Federation spokesman Ademola Olajire told BBC Sport: "We received a letter from Chelsea concerning Moses and striker Isaac Success has a knock and finding it difficult to walk. "Locally-based stars Godwin Obaje and Chisom Egbuchulam will replace the premier league duo, while Uche Agbo has since filled the void created by Balogun's absence." Egbuchulam's 15 goals, including a hat-trick on the final day of the season on Sunday, led Enugu Rangers to their seventh Nigerian league title - their first in 32 years. Wikki Tourists in-form striker Obaje finished as top scorer with 18 goals to steer his club to a third place finish and a spot in next year's Caf Confederation Cup. Odion Ighalo has been left out to attend the burial of his father a day before the match. But John Mikel Obi is also on the 23-man list despite not playing for Chelsea yet this season. Obi captained Nigeria at the Olympics in Brazil and led them to a bronze medal but has not featured for new Chelsea boss Antonio Conte since his return. Coach Gernot Rohr has largely kept faith with the side that earned a 1-0 win over Tanzania in a dead-rubber 2017 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier in early September. But there are recalls for Arsenal forward Alex Iwobi, Chelsea loanee Kenneth Omeruo and Belgium-based midfielder Anderson Esiti, who all missed Rohr's first game in charge of the Super Eagles. Injured Moses Simon is listed after assuring Rohr that he would be fully fit before the game. Nigeria are in Group B, with Cameroon and Algeria - who have both been at the past two World Cup finals - alongside 2012 Africa Cup of Nations winners Zambia. There are five groups of four teams with only the winners of each group making it to the tournament in Russia. Nigeria have missed out on the last Nations Cups but have appeared at the last two World Cups in South Africa and Brazil, reaching the last 16 in 2014. Nigeria squad: Goalkeepers: Carl Ikeme (Wolverhampton Wanderers, England); Emmanuel Daniel (Enugu Rangers); Ikechukwu Ezenwa (FC IfeanyiUbah) Defenders: Uche Agbo (Granada - on loan from Watford, Spain); William Troost-Ekong (Haugesund FC, Norway);  Kenneth Omeruo (Alanyaspor FC, Turkey); Jamiu Alimi (Kano Pillars); Abdullahi Shehu (Anorthosis Famagusta, Cyprus); Musa Muhammed (Istanbul Basaksehir, Turkey); Elderson Echiejile (Standard Liege, Belgium), Kingsley Madu (SV Zulte Waregem, Belgium) Midfielders: John Mikel Obi (Chelsea, England); Ogenyi Onazi (Trabzonspor, Turkey); Wilfred Ndidi (KRC Genk, Belgium); Nosa Igiebor (Maccabi Tel Aviv, Israel), Anderson Esiti (KAA Gent, Belgium) Forwards: Ahmed Musa (Leicester City, England); Kelechi Iheanacho (Manchester City, England); Moses Simon (KAA Gent, Belgium); Alex Iwobi (Arsenal FC, England); Brown Ideye (Olympiacos FC, Greece); Godwin Obaje (Wikki Tourists); Chisom Egbuchulam (Enugu Rangers)	Watford's Isaac Success will not make his Nigeria debut in their 2018 World Cup qualifier against Zambia after picking up an injury.
Alice Gross, 14, was found in the River Brent in west London in September 2014. Days later the body of Latvian builder Arnis Zalkalns was found nearby. The inquest into her death will look into whether failures by the government and the police contributed to her death and will examine why Zalkalns was allowed to live unchecked in the UK. Reading from a prepared statement at the inquest at the Royal Courts of Justice, Alice's mother Rosalind Hodgkiss said the family wanted to "establish whether or not the systems for monitoring foreign offenders and cross-border sharing of information are robust". She added: "We appreciate that they may have changed significantly, but we remain stunned that a foreign national with a conviction for murder was not monitored, or even known about in any way. "This has destroyed much of our faith in our country's ability to protect its citizens. "The Home Office and the police forces nationwide should be doing everything they can to ensure that this should not be allowed to happen again." Ms Hodgkiss described her daughter as "lively and popular" as well as "witty, sharp and academic". She said Alice was a keen songwriter and it was "impossible to convey the devastation her death had caused to the family". She added: "We have many unanswered questions. We will never know exactly what happened on that day." Alice went missing on 28 August 2014 after leaving for a walk along the canal. Her body was found a month later following what the Met Police called the largest inquiry since the 7/7 bombings in 2005. Pathologist Dr Ashley Fegan-Earl told the inquest her body had been discovered in the River Brent, tied into a foetal position and weighted down by bricks, logs and a bicycle wheel. He concluded she had been sexually assaulted and asphyxiated, probably by being prevented from breathing by a larger person pressing on her torso. Zalkalns was the chief suspect in Alice's death and the Metropolitan Police and Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) both said he would have been charged with her murder had he not died. Zalkalns was convicted of murdering his wife in Latvia in 1998.	The mother of a schoolgirl who police believe was killed by a foreign convicted murderer said she was stunned he was not being monitored.
Catherine -  also known as the Countess of Strathearn in Scotland - joined dozens of school pupils and teachers at a tennis workshop hosted by Ms Murray in Edinburgh. Earlier she took part in a sing-along on a visit to an Edinburgh school. The events were part of a tour by Catherine of school-based charities in the city. The workshop was part of the Tennis on the Road project created in 2014 by Ms Murray, who is the mother of tennis stars Andy and Jamie. During the duchess' visit, teachers and pupils were taught how to coach and pass on the basics of tennis to children. Ms Murray said Catherine's participation in the class was "fantastic for tennis and women's sport". She added: "She said she'd love to come back and do some more." Earlier in the day, Catherine visited St Catherine's Primary where she joined an assembly. The school is one of 28 in Scotland where counsellors from children's mental health charity Place2Be support pupils having difficulties in some of the most disadvantaged areas of Glasgow and Edinburgh. Pupils presented her with a quaich, a Scottish toasting cup, after she sang along to the children's song Welcome Everybody. The duchess, who is the charity's patron, told pupils: "I think everybody should start their morning like that. Have a wonderful day." The duchess, who was carrying out her first solo set of official engagements north of the border, also travelled across the city to Wester Hailes Education Centre to see work being carried out by The Art Room. The charity, of which she is patron, set up its first Scottish studio at the school in 2014 and works with children to increase their self-esteem, self-confidence and independence through art. She was greeted by cheering pupils in the school playground before attending an art session. Pupils involved in the project showed her the work they were producing. Project director Juli Beattie said she was delighted to be able to show the duchess the charity's first Scottish base. She added: "Our presence in Edinburgh represents a new phase in our growth. "The needs of the local community are imperative and our work relies on our partner schools having the vision to host an art-room studio offering early intervention to the children and young people."	The Duchess of Cambridge has shown off her tennis skills during a practice session with Judy Murray.
WhatsApp and similar applications make it possible for news organisations to reach the far-flung corners of the globe where other media are often blocked. Here are a few recent examples of how you have enhanced BBC News output by getting in touch via the app. A total of 38 people were killed in an attack on a beach in Tunisia on 26 June 2015. They were killed when a gunman, with links to so-called Islamic State extremists, opened fire on a beach in Sousse, outside two hotels. He had hidden a gun under a beach umbrella and he threw grenades, forcing people to run for their lives. Eyewitness Anthony Ryan got in touch with us as the news was breaking. He was able to tell us what was happening from his balcony. He could see his hotel's entertainers on the beach and could hear shouting. He could also see that two people had been brought into the hotel next door on sun beds, and were badly injured. Simon Philips shared his experience of the attacks in Paris on the night of Friday 13 November. Gunmen and suicide bombers attacked a concert hall, a major stadium, restaurants and bars, almost simultaneously. Mr Philips, a dual French and British citizen, was sitting with his girlfriend outside La Belle Equipe bar in the rue de Charonne in the 11th district, when two men opened fire on the terrace of the cafe. He described what he had seen as "endless scenes of war". "It was complete and utter chaos. The noise of the bullets outweighed those of screams and sirens afterwards," he said. Earlier last year, we reported on the most powerful earthquake to have hit Nepal in decades. Hundreds of people were killed, and many others were trapped and injured in the quake in April. Many of the BBC's eyewitnesses to this quake came through WhatsApp, which is widely used in that part of the world. Those affected ranged from local people to the region's many tourists and climbers on Mount Everest. As well as keeping us informed of news stories, you have been telling us how you use WhatsApp every day. Jean Macleod from Glasgow, UK, says she uses it every day to message her son, Ewan, in Australia. "He's in Sydney and I'm in Glasgow. It keeps us in touch every morning and night, and if I didn't have it I'd completely crash as I miss him so much. We're not always available at the same times, so it's a bonus alongside phone calls. I use it on holiday too. Last year, on holidays in Uganda, I kept in touch with all my family including my daughter in London, and husband in Glasgow." Mal Smith agrees: "I use WhatsApp to speak to relatives in Switzerland and for sending video and pictures to family and friends. My mobile provider charges me extra for sending pictures over their network." And Julia Kinsey says she uses it at home in rural Suffolk, UK. "Mobile signal is very patchy in our house," she said. "So I use it for communicating with family in London and friends nationwide. I would feel very isolated without it." Compiled by Francesca Neagle	Mobile messaging service WhatsApp is now said to be used by a billion people monthly, but it is not just a conduit for social chat and event planning.
Manager Neil Warnock has made it clear he will give the midfielder time to mull over the new deal on offer. "If they want to consider it for a length of time, that is all right for me. I think you have to show respect to Peter," said Warnock. Whittingham, 32, celebrated ten years at the club last month. His current contract is due to expire this summer. Warnock said: "He has an offer on the table. It is down to them now really. I spoke to his agent again this morning on the way in. "I think we have to leave that down to Peter. Obviously negotiations are to and fro, but the offer is on the table and will stay on the table. "I said to them I am not in a rush, the offer is on the table, I won't withdraw the offer." Whittingham opened the scoring in the Bluebirds 2-0 win over Preston. He will be looking for the chance to add to his tally against Norwich City, in Saturday's Championship clash in the Welsh capital. Warnock has made it clear Wales international Emyr Huws and fellow midfielder Stuart O'Keefe are not in his long term plans. Huws went on loan to Ipswich on deadline day while O'Keefe also made a loan move to League One side MK Dons.	Cardiff City are waiting to discover if midfielder Peter Whittingham will sign a new contract.
After an urgent meeting in New York, the council said it would soon adopt a new sanctions resolution in response. Pyongyang said it fired the rocket to place a satellite in orbit - but critics believe the real purpose was to test a ballistic missile. Sunday's launch comes weeks after North Korea held a fourth nuclear test - both acts violate UN resolutions. Speaking after the closed-door talks, Venezuela's UN envoy Rafael Ramirez, the current council president, said: "The members of the Security Council strongly condemn this launch." He called it "a serious violation of the Security Council resolution". US Ambassador to the UN Samantha Power said Washington would now "ensure that the Security Council imposes serious consequences" on Pyongyang. "There can be no business as usual," she said, adding that "we'll come up with something tough". Ms Power's words were echoed by Japanese envoy Motohide Yoshikawa, who said sanctions must be strengthened. "The existing sanctions have not stopped North Korea from developing nuclear weapons," he said. The council meeting was requested by South Korea, Japan and the US. North Korea satellite launch - world reaction Why did Kim fire a rocket now? The launch of the rocket was hailed by North Korean media as a "fascinating vapour... trailing in the clear and blue sky in spring of February on the threshold of the Day of the Shining Star". A statement said a new Earth observation satellite, Kwangmyongsong-4, had successfully been put into orbit less than 10 minutes after lift-off from the Sohae space centre in North Phyongan province. Hailing it as part of the country's peaceful space programme, a state TV newsreader said the launch had been ordered by North Korea's leader Kim Jon-un and more satellite launches were planned for the future. South Korean MPs were told by the country's spy agency later on Sunday that the launch should be treated as a ballistic missile test - as the satellite it put into orbit would be useless. The payload was presumed to weigh 200kg (440lbs), double the size of the one launched in 2012, but much lighter than the 800-1,500kg usual for a satellite. The MPs were also reportedly told that North Korea had the technology for intercontinental ballistic missiles and was preparing a fifth nuclear test. North Korea last fired a long-range rocket in 2012 to put, what it said was, a communications satellite into orbit. But experts say no signal has ever been detected. UN Security Council resolutions ban the state from carrying out any nuclear or ballistic missile tests. The North insists its space programme is purely scientific in nature but the US, South Korea and even China say the rocket launches are aimed at developing inter-continental ballistic missiles.

Isolated country's nuclear tests A world leader in dramatic rhetoric	The UN Security Council has strongly condemned North Korea's launch of a long-range rocket.
Convicted murderer Sweat, 35, was shot twice and captured less than two miles (3km) from the Canadian border. His prison-break partner Richard Matt, 49, was killed by police on Friday. The two murderers escaped three weeks ago from the maximum security Clinton Correctional Facility in Dannemora through the sewer system after using power tools to break out of their cell. The spectacular escape set off a massive manhunt. Sweat was shot and seized in the town of Constable on Sunday, New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo told a news conference. He said Sweat was shot twice in the torso and was now in hospital in stable condition. The convict was spotted by a police officer on patrol and shot when he tried to run away. "The nightmare is finally over," the governor said. Meanwhile, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives wrote on its Twitter page: "#DavidSweat of the #PrisonBreakNY captured. Sleep peacefully New York." The Buffalo News website earlier quoted a source who said that the convict's wound were "life-threatening" and he was bleeding badly. Matt was shot dead near the town of Malone. The pair had been making their way through rugged forests in upstate New York, stealing food and guns from woodland cabins along the way. US officials have charged prison worker Joyce Mitchell with aiding the two inmates in their escape. Prosecutors allege that she gave the men power tools that allowed them to saw through a steel cell wall before bashing a hole through a brick wall and crawling through. Ms Mitchell denies the charges. Clinton correction officer Gene Palmer is also accused of aiding the convicts. Officials allege that he gave Sweat and Matt the frozen hamburger meat Ms Mitchell had used to hide hacksaw blades and a screwdriver. Mr Palmer's attorney said his client had no knowledge that the meat contained the escape tools. Matt was serving a prison sentence of 25 years to life for the killing and dismembering of his former boss. Sweat was serving a life sentence for murdering a sheriff's deputy. Manhunt timeline	Second New York State prison escapee David Sweat is in custody after being shot by police, US officials report.
The 23-year-old batsman has set himself two goals; scoring 1,000 first-class runs for the first time in his career and breaking into the county's one-day team. Wells came close to his first target last season, when he scored 982 Championship runs at an average of 37.76, but he is eager to keep improving. "I expect a lot from myself because I believe I am a good enough player to deliver bigger and better results," he told BBC Sport. "Although I have done reasonably well over the last three years I don't feel I have done as well as I could have or should have done. Statistics correct at 31 May "I feel my average isn't as high as it should be and that I should have hit 1,000 runs by now. "You'd rather be expecting more than be satisfied with average results. Moving forward you always have to have the will to improve and exceed expectations. "I don't put pressure on myself. I just see it as a challenge." The left-hander believes he should have reached the 1,000-run milestone in 2013. "If I didn't give away a couple of innings I would have got there," he said. "I spent my winter in Sydney and definitely improved. I feel I've opened up a few areas through the offside I may not have had previously and am targeting about 1,100 or 1,200 runs. "The only difference is when you are in and on 40, that you give it away. If you convert those into slightly higher scores, when then there is no reason why you should get out, then I will be at 1,200 runs. "I feel I am a better player now and I have the mental concentration and the defensive technique to do it." Ahead of the current match against Nottinghamshire at Hove, Wells had scored 221 runs in his five Championship appearances this season - with his high score of 79 not out coming against Somerset in April. He admits he is "a fair way" off his target but is keen to contribute to Sussex's title challenge, with the Hove side currently fifth in the Division One table. I am targeting about 1,100 or 1,200 runs. I feel I am a better player now and I have the mental concentration and the defensive technique to do it "I feel in really good nick at the moment and that there's a big three-figure score just around the corner," he said. "I know if I keep doing the same things and backing myself I'll score a good amount of runs. "It may sound cliched but if I get a thousand runs and we win the title then brilliant. If I get 900 and we win the title I'll take that. As long as the runs I'm scoring are contributing to winning efforts that is most important. "We have got a strong squad and one hallmark of this season so far is competition for batting spaces. Everyone is under pressure as you know you need to get your runs. "That is the way it should be in any squad. You shouldn't be able to rest on your laurels as people around you want to take your spot." The former England Under-19 international, who is the son of former Sussex captain and one-time England Test player Alan, believes his time in Australia has improved his all-round game. "I had a clear basic goal which was to work on a couple of technical areas to do with my trigger and my stance to be in a better position so that I can move more freely and make me more dynamic at the crease," he said. "I feel I am a lot quicker on my feet, which will help in all formats of my game. I've worked on shots through the off-side, my one-day skills in general and my fitness." Wells, meanwhile, describes his efforts to break into Sussex's one-day side as "difficult and frustrating". The Eastbourne-born player has only made one competitive Twenty20 appearance for the club, coming against Glamorgan in 2011, and has made just a handful of appearances in List A competition. Sussex have performed strongly in both Twenty20 and 40-over competition in recent years, but made group-stage exits in both formats in 2013. Wells says the county calendar has not helped his cause but hopes the new schedule, which sees the T20 Blast played throughout the season and the new 50-over One Day Cup played in July and August, could benefit him. "So far in my career I've started well in four-day competition then T20 comes along, I have a big break in the middle of my season and I try to find a way to keep the momentum going," he said. "It has been quite hard work. I think this year with the Friday nights will help. "I've been pushing as hard as I can and have been working a lot on my one-day skills. I can strike a ball as far as anyone in the squad. "It is just about putting it all together into performances in the middle. "It is hard with the schedule in and around four-day cricket to find time to play second XI T20 games. "You need your currency, as it were, to show the coaches that you can do it." Wells did play five CB40 matches for Sussex last season but only managed to make seven runs in four innings. "Unfortunately last year I did get a run at the top of the order but I got out," he said. "They were classic dismissals - a caught behind and a couple of lbws - but that's the way it goes. That is suddenly four games and you haven't scored a run. "I feel I am in a good place with my game and am offering other skills, not just with my batting. I am determined to get in the side. "Every year we always push quite hard in one-day competitions and have had quite a lot of success. Last year we didn't have that and I was disappointed to not get a go in a T20 game come the end of the campaign. "Having said that the team needed its momentum and wanted to go with the same guys, which is absolutely understandable. "All I can do is put myself in the best possible position that when I do get a chance, to take it."	Luke Wells has established himself in Sussex's County Championship side but is hungry for more.
Media playback is not supported on this device Al Hasawi, who took control of the Reds in the summer of 2012, would not reveal the identity of the buyers. However, BBC Sport understands that a United States consortium, led by millionaire John Jay Moores, is on the verge of securing a £50m deal. The takeover would see the former San Diego Padres owner take an 80% stake in the Championship club. Moores' consortium were previously interested in buying Premier League side Everton, and the potential new owners met club staff last week.	Nottingham Forest owner and chairman Fawaz Al Hasawi says he is close to agreeing a deal to sell the club.
About seven miles (11km) of shoreline, including beaches at Great Yarmouth, Gorleston and from Scratby to North Denes, were affected by the flooding. On Scratby beach alone, it is believed there are about 6,000 sq metres (65,000 sq ft) of waste, 3ft deep (1 metre). The operation is expected to take several weeks. Before Christmas, staff from Great Yarmouth Borough Council took away any potentially hazardous material, including gas bottles, fridges and freezers. Now workers are left with glass, wire and wood to dispose of. George Jarvis, from Great Yarmouth Borough Services, said a lot of manpower was being used to sift through the debris. "We did consider burning on the beach, but looking at the weather forecast we're due to have quite a lot of wet weather this week," he said. "Also the prevailing winds coming in from the sea would have blown quite a lot of thick, black smoke into public areas." There is no estimate for the total cost of the clear-up, as it is not yet known how long it will take. The council hopes to recoup the money spent through the government's Bellwin Scheme. The Bellwin Scheme was introduced in the 1980s to provide some government support for flood-hit areas, but only provides funds for temporary flood measures and the work must be undertaken within two months of the flood.	Work has begun to clear up hundreds of tonnes of waste washed up on Norfolk beaches during last month's North Sea tidal surge.
The 25-year-old Ghana defender, who arrived from League Two side Barnet in May 2016, was left out of Saturday's home defeat by Ipswich having started their two previous games. Heckingbottom said talks with Premier League newcomers are ongoing. "In my eyes I don't have Yids until I'm told different," he said. Talking to BBC Radio Sheffield, Heckingbottom added: "It wasn't right for me to involve Yids in the game on Saturday and if it is still the same, it won't be Tuesday because it is not fair on the other players. "We are all preparing for our game and obviously Yids is in limbo at the minute. "Until it is resolved one way or another and I'm told, I'm not considering him." Heckingbottom added that negotiations for the player, who made 33 appearances for the Championship club last season, "can't go much longer" and that he "expects" Yiadom's future to be known by Thursday. "I'm not thinking about it until after the game on Tuesday," he said.	Barnsley boss Paul Heckingbottom says Huddersfield Town target Andy Yiadom will not be considered for selection while he is "in limbo".
The Lions, who won the semi-final first leg 3-1, looked to have put the tie to bed when Lee Gregory slotted home. But Jamie Proctor's strike just before half-time, after Jordan Archer blocked his first effort, gave City hope. Proctor then wasted a further chance moments later, and it proved costly as Millwall held on to set up a showdown with Barnsley on 29 May. Neil Harris' side were rarely troubled after Proctor twice turned down the opportunity to shoot when excellently placed - and, if anything, they looked the more likely to score again after the break. Centre-half Byron Webster came closest, sending a header narrowly wide of Ben Williams' post, as the second leg petered out in front of a raucous crowd at The Den. Millwall's success against Bradford means that, across this season's Football League play-offs, all five teams who won the first leg of their semi-final went on to reach Wembley. The majority of the damage was done even before half-time at Valley Parade, where goals from Gregory, Steve Morison and Joe Martin had put the Lions in full command against Bradford. The Bantams have twice previously come back from a first-leg deficit to progress to the final and win promotion, but Gregory's calm, side-footed finish ensured there would be no repeat in south-east London. Millwall must now beat Barnsley, who thumped Walsall 6-1 over two legs in the other semi-final, if they are to secure an instant return to the Championship. Millwall manager Neil Harris: "I'm delighted for the players, They deserved it over the two legs. "We really had to battle, both tonight and last Sunday. It was tough but we've earned our place at Wembley. "Barnsley will be really tough opponents. They've done brilliantly all season and especially against Walsall."

They say the lengths of tiny pieces of DNA called telomeres indicate whether a young creature is likely to live long into old age. But before you rush out to get your telomeres stretched - were such a process possible - it is worth pointing out that the creatures they have been working with are not humans but altogether shorter-lived zebra finches. Everything that is made up of living cells contains chromosomes: the genetic code that makes us what we are. At the ends of each chromosome lie the telomeres. They have been likened to the caps on the ends of shoelaces - they stop things from unravelling. Over time they wear down - and when they do, the DNA they protect is compromised and the cell can malfunction or die. This is where the zebra finches came in: how early and accurately could longer telomeres predict a longer life? To find out, the Glasgow researchers collaborated with colleagues at Exeter University, with Glasgow's Prof Pat Monaghan leading the team. Tiny blood samples were taken from a group of 99 zebra finches and the lengths of their telomeres measured. They were tested again throughout their lifetimes. To find out how long the birds lived, the researchers had to wait until they died.  The first turned up its claws in just over six months.  But the last hardy specimen kept them waiting almost nine years. In every case the longest lived birds had the longest telomeres, but the best predictor of lifespan was the length of the telomeres at just 25 days old. Prof Monaghan says the study shows the importance of processes acting early in life. The next step will be to find out why the length of telomeres can vary so much from individual to individual. "We now need to know more about how early life conditions can influence the pattern of telomere loss and the relative importance of inherited and environmental factors," she said. The results of the research have been published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA. They are certain to raise the question of whether our telomeres are similar predictors of how long we will live. But it is a big leap from the laboratory to the real world - whatever our telomeres may say, human lifespans also have to contend with additional factors like diet, drink and stress. Wild finches, meanwhile, have snakes and birds of prey to worry about. The bottom line for now?  Ask not for whom the zebra finch chirps...	Scientists at Glasgow University say they have found a key genetic indicator of how long an individual will live.
Temperton died in London last week at the age of 66 after "a brief aggressive battle with cancer", Jon Platt of Warner/Chappell music publishing said. Temperton's other hits included Off The Wall and Baby Be Mine for Jackson and Boogie Nights for his band Heatwave. Chic guitarist Nile Rodgers was among those paying tribute, tweeting: "Your genius gave us a funkier world!" Michael Jackson's sister LaToya wrote: "A brilliant prolific #songwriter Rod Temperton may you #RIP one of my favorite #songs Rock With You #Thriller #legend #Music #MichaelJackson" Producer and DJ Mark Ronson wrote: "So devastated to hear that Rod Temperton has passed away. a wonderful man & one of my favourite songwriters ever. thank you for the magic x" Temperton, whose private funeral has taken place, was nicknamed The Invisible Man because of his low profile. Born in Cleethorpes, North East Lincolnshire, Temperton traced his songwriting ability back to his father's influence. "My father wasn't the kind of person who would read you a story before you went off to sleep," he once said. "He used to put a transistor radio in the crib and I would go to sleep listening to Radio Luxembourg, and I think somehow that had an influence." In the 1970s, after a spell working in a frozen food factory in Grimsby, he answered an advert in Melody Maker magazine for a keyboardist. The band he joined was disco group Heatwave, and his songs like Boogie Nights, Always & Forever and Groove Line became big hits for the band in the 1970s. By the time he left the band in 1978, his tunes had caught the attention of producer Quincy Jones, who was looking for songwriters for a new Michael Jackson LP. Temperton penned three songs for Off The Wall, which became Jackson's breakthrough solo album - the title track, Rock With You and Burn This Disco Out. He went on to write three more for follow-up Thriller - the title track, which became one of Jackson's signature smashes, plus Baby Be Mine and The Lady in My Life. They helped make Thriller the best-selling album of all time in the US, with 32 million copies sold. His tunes have also been recorded by artists including Anita Baker, Donna Summer, Aretha Franklin and The Brothers Johnson. Temperton won a Grammy Award in 1990 for his work on Birdland, from Quincy Jones's album Back on the Block. He was nominated for two Oscars in 1986 for his work with Jones on the soundtrack for The Color Purple. He once summed up his approach to songwriting: "The first criteria is write something you love first, and once you feel those hairs standing up on the back of your hand, you can go to the world." In a statement released on Wednesday, Warner/Chappell's Jon Platt said: "His family is devastated and request total privacy at this, the saddest of sad times." Vocalist Chaka Khan, who recorded Temperton's tracks with the funk band Rufus, paid tribute, writing on Twitter: "Thank u 4 your superlative songwriting @RodTemperton. U will always Live in Me. Rest in power." BBC radio presenter Gilles Peterson wrote: "Apart from Lennon and McCartney no one from the UK has written more gold plated songs than Sir Rod Temperton... a huge loss. RIP" Follow us on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, on Instagram at bbcnewsents, or if you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.

Joe Root, Alex Hales, Moeen Ali and Mark Wood also return for the tie with Pakistan at Old Trafford on 7 September after missing Sri Lanka in July. Liam Dawson, Chris Woakes, James Vince, and Dawid Malan all miss out. However, rapid T20 specialist Tymal Mills retains his place. Stokes missed the tie against Sri Lanka, which England won by eight wickets, but has figured in the ongoing five-match ODI series, in which they have beaten Pakistan in the first three fixtures. England impressed at Trent Bridge on Tuesday, scoring an international ODI record 444-3. Hales scored 171 in that match, the highest score by an England batsman in limited overs cricket, while Root added 85 - his fifth consecutive ODI half-century. Liam Dawson took 3-27 on debut against Sri Lanka, but misses out as Test spinner Ali returns, while Malan drops out of the squad without making his debut. National selector, James Whitaker, said: "It is excellent to see the progress we are making in white ball cricket across both formats. "It is testament to the excellent work being nurtured in the county structure and through the England Lions, that there is a depth of quality pushing the nucleus of the current group."

The Canal & River Trust said the path at Pontcysyllte Aqueduct would close between 09:00 GMT and 15:00 from Monday until 17 February. The towpath will be open outside these hours from Monday to Saturday and will be open all day on Sundays. Repair work is needed on the parapet of the 126ft (38m) tall structure. The Canal & River Trust said said: "These measures are to protect the public whilst we undertake these important works, allowing them to be undertaken safely by our operatives."	Maintenance work on a Wrexham aqueduct means the towpath will be closed for six hours a day.
Tuition fees for 2017 are listed on Durham, Kent and Royal Holloway websites as £9,250. MPs will vote in the autumn on whether to allow an increase in tuition fees. The government will support an increase if universities can show they have high quality teaching. Announcing a higher level of fees of £9,250 was attacked as "disgraceful arrogance from some universities" by the Liberal Democrat education spokesman John Pugh. The proposal to raise fees is "not a done deal", says Mr Pugh. Sally Hunt, leader of the UCU lecturers' union, said: 'Those universities foolish enough to advertise higher fees will be doing nothing to quell concerns from students and parents that they are simply after as much cash as they can get." The higher level fees now being advertised are for undergraduate courses starting in autumn 2017. Students will start applying for these courses after the summer holidays. There are references on university websites to fees being "subject to government confirmation" and "inflationary changes", but this comes before MPs have voted on legislation which will link fee increases to standards of teaching. There will also be a separate vote by MPs in the autumn on whether to permit an increase in tuition fees above £9,000. Under the government's proposals, if universities meet a threshold of good-quality teaching, they will be able to increase fees with inflation, which for 2017 is calculated as allowing an extra £250. At this rate, tuition fees could be over £10,000 within the next four years. The plans in the Higher Education and Research Bill are before Parliament and in a debate on Tuesday, Labour's Gordon Marsden warned this inflation link meant there was no guarantee on how high fees could rise. The process that will be created to measure teaching quality in universities is called the "teaching excellence framework". This framework does not yet exist, but for its first year the government has said that almost all universities will be assessed as having reached a quality threshold, allowing them to push their fees above the £9,000 upper limit. It means that almost all universities will be able to charge £9,250 for their autumn 2017 intake, making it in effect the new upper limit. Labour's shadow education minister Gordon Marsden said it was a "back-door attempt to raise fees, without a proper and open debate in Parliament, by linking it to a teaching excellence framework which hasn't yet been defined". But the Liberal Democrats' Mr Pugh said "The real question is whether government is giving these institutions the green light to advertise higher fees. "They've not even shown their plans for linking fee rises to Parliament. So why are they giving universities the impression that they will pass their teaching quality assessment?" The University of Kent said the fee increase represented inflation of 2.8%, which could be applied "where higher education providers achieve a rating of 'meets expectations' under the teaching excellence framework". A statement said it had published the higher fee "to ensure that both potential students and existing students are provided with as much notice as possible" and to comply with consumer protection guidelines. Durham University issued a statement saying it was setting fees in line with what the government was going to allow and said "we are required to provide comprehensive and transparent information to applicants". Responding to MPs' concerns about tuition fee increases, Education Secretary Justine Greening told the House of Commons on Tuesday: "This will rightly continue to require the same level of parliamentary scrutiny as before and the Bill will allow the maximum fee cap to keep pace with inflation." The government argues that without an inflationary increase, the value of tuition fees, providing £11.6bn to universities, will be eroded. Other universities are still advertising fees at £9,000, but with a warning about a possible increase. Manchester Metropolitan University advertises fees of £9,000 for 2017, but with a note that says "these fees are regulated by the UK government, and so may increase each year in line with government policy". The University of Newcastle quotes a £9,000 fee but says it might increase with inflation for those entering in 2017. Other universities, such as University College London, have so far not published fees for 2017 on their websites. The increase in fees in England to £9,000 per year was introduced in 2012 by the coalition government and prompted angry protests from students. In Scottish universities, students from Scotland do not have to pay tuition fees. Northern Irish students at Northern Irish universities have fees of up to £3,925 and Welsh students have fees of £3,810. Sorana Vieru, vice president of the National Union of Students, warned of higher levels of debt for students. "A further fee rise will have a damaging impact on students and it is frustrating to learn universities were lobbying the minister for the fee rise before the reforms were published." A government spokeswoman said: "The teaching excellence framework will allow universities to maintain fees in line with inflation only if they meet a quality bar, as set out in the recent higher education White Paper."	Universities in England are already announcing a tuition fee increase above the £9,000 limit before Parliament has even finished debating plans which would pave the way to raise fees.
Thousands of sufferers and their dependants will be able to get damages from a £350m pot over the next decade. Those diagnosed after 25 July 2012 and who cannot sue former employers as they have gone bust or insurance details have disappeared will be eligible. Ministers said it was a "major breakthrough" to "end an injustice". Mesothelioma is a fatal disease with average survival rates of about nine months after diagnosis. It is most prevalent among those who worked in industries with heavy exposure to asbestos up to the 1980s, including construction, shipbuilding, engineering and power generation. About 2,400 people die every year of the disease and numbers are set to increase over the next 30 years, with an estimated death toll of between 56,000 and 63,000. While some people have taken legal action to recover damages, many are deterred because of the stress involved. The speed with which the disease takes hold means many die before their cases are heard. Victims and their families have, up to now, been able to claim damages under two pieces of legislation but the sums paid have not generally exceeded £20,000. Under the proposed new fund, which must receive parliamentary approval, UK claimants will be entitled to 75% of the average settlement paid out in civil actions relating to mesothelioma, expected to be about £115,000. Claimants will have to demonstrate that they were negligently exposed to asbestos at work and are unable to claim compensation because they cannot track down a liable employer or insurer. "This scheme represents a major breakthrough for the many victims of this terrible disease, who have been failed by successive governments and the insurance industry for decades," said Work and Pensions Minister Mike Penning. "It will end an injustice that has left many tragic victims and their families high and dry. "The aggressive and terminal nature of this disease, coupled with the fact we're approaching a peak in cases in the coming years, makes it imperative that we get this legislation in place as soon as possible," he added. According to government calculations, 900 people are likely to qualify for support in 2014, with a further 300 expected to get assistance in each of the following nine years. If the Mesothelioma Bill currently before Parliament is passed in the next few months, it is hoped the first payments will be made next July. There has been anger that ministers have proposed a cut-off point for claims and that those diagnosed before 25 July last year, when the scheme was first announced, will not be eligible. Officials have defended the move, saying that an open-ended commitment to compensate all those afflicted by the disease would simply not be affordable. Those suffering from other asbestos-related conditions, such as asbestosis, will also not be eligible. One campaign group said the proposals were a "drastic improvement" on the current support available. But it said the cut-off point seemed "arbitrary and harsh" and some victims felt it was unfair that they were not able to claim 100% of the value of a civil settlement. Mesothelioma often takes 40 to 50 years to manifest itself after exposure and most of those being diagnosed are males in their 60s and older. The scheme will be paid for by the insurance industry. All insurers will have to register on a voluntary database established in 2011 listing employers' liability insurance policies, both current and historic.	Victims of mesothelioma, an aggressive form of cancer caused by exposure to asbestos, will be able to claim far larger compensation under a new fund.
Mr Bich, who is of Vietnamese origin, shot to fame last week over his complaint that his account had been shut down because Facebook considered his name fake or misleading. The post dated back to January, but received hundreds of thousands of likes late last week. Mr Bich said he hoped he had "played a part in brightening your days". His name when properly pronounced in Vietnamese, which is a tonal language, sounds like "Phoo Da Bi", and is relatively common in Vietnam. Mr Phuc originally posted his complaint on 28 January, accompanied with his passport photo, saying: "I find it highly irritating the fact that nobody seems to believe me when I say that my full legal name is how you see it. "I've been accused of using a false and misleading name of which I find very offensive," the 23-year-old bank worker wrote. "Is it because I'm Asian? Is it?" Thousands of people left comments on his post, with some advising him to change his name. Others, however, left encouraging messages. It was picked up around the world. On Sunday night, Mr Phuc wrote a new post saying he was "very grateful to those who have been supportive of certain names that populate in different cultures." "We live in a diverse and multicultural society and the fact that there are people out there who are supportive and encouraging really makes me happy," Mr Phuc wrote. "I am glad and honoured to be able to make people happy by simply making them laugh at something that appears outrageous and ridiculous." Facebook has not commented directly on Mr Bich's case, but its policy on usernames state that people "provide the name they use in real life" for safety reasons, and that it "should be your authentic identity; as your friends call you in real life and as our acceptable identification forms would show", such as passports. Among other things it asks users to refrain from using "offensive or suggestive words of any kind" in their Facebook names.	An Australian man, Phuc Dat Bich, has said he is glad his fight to use his name on Facebook has made people happy.
Synchronised wreath-laying ceremonies will take place in counties Cork, Meath, Wexford, Galway and Dublin, beginning at 09:45 local time in Cork. Thousands of people lined the streets of Dublin on Sunday for a parade to mark the centenary. The commemoration events have been organised by the Irish government. The rebellion is viewed as a seminal event in the founding of the state. The Easter Rising was quelled within six days by British troops, but despite its failure it is seen as a significant stepping stone to the eventual creation of the Republic of Ireland and the partition of Ireland. More than 450 people were killed and 2,500 injured during the fighting. A weekend of events to mark the centenary of the Rising began on Saturday with a remembrance ceremony in Dublin at which Irish president Michael D Higgins laid a wreath. Wreaths were also laid in Dublin at Kilmainham Gaol, where 14 of the Rising's leaders were executed, and at the Sigerson Monument in Glasnevin Cemetery, which is dedicated to to all those who lost their lives in the Rising. The synchronised wreath-laying ceremonies on Monday have been organised by the Irish Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht (Irish-speaking areas). The locations and times are: Then, at 12:30 local time, wreaths will be laid at various buildings and landmarks around the Irish capital that became focal points during the rebellion. They include Boland's Mill, Jacob's Factory, Dublin Castle/City Hall, The Four Courts, Royal College of Surgeons and Moore Street.	The centenary of the Easter Rising, the rebellion that began on Easter Monday 1916, is to be marked in Irish towns and cities with wreath-laying events.
Fatima Elomar, 31, was intercepted at Sydney Airport in May last year as she tried to board an international flight. Cash, camouflage gear and medical supplies were found in her luggage. In a brief court appearance, she pleaded guilty to supporting incursions into a foreign state with the intention of engaging in hostile activities. Mohamed Elomar travelled to Syria and then Iraq in 2013 to fight with so-called Islamic State (IS). Court documents reportedly detail text messages between the couple in which Ms Elomar begs her husband to return home for medical treatment after being shot. Mr Elomar reportedly told his wife to prepare the children's passports so they could be together in Raqqa, Syria. Mr Elomar, and fellow Australian Khaled Sharrouf came to public attention last year after they posted pictures of themselves posing with severed heads to social media. One of those images showed Sharrouf's seven-year-old son holding up the severed head of a Syrian soldier. It is believed Elomar died in June during an air strike on a convoy of vehicles near IS's self-declared capital of Raqqa. The Australian government estimated in September that around 120 Australians were currently in Iraq and Syria to support IS and other terror groups.	The wife of one of Australia's most notorious extremists, Mohamed Elomar, has pleaded guilty to supporting overseas terrorism.
A total of 1,400 tickets have sold out for the opening weekend at Bramall Hall in Stockport, Greater Manchester after renovation work began in 2014. Stained glass windows and ceilings have been restored, while the public will be able to visit the dining room and butler's pantry for the first time. Councillor Kate Butler, from Stockport Council, called it the "jewel in the crown" of the town's heritage. The manor dates back to the reign of William the Conqueror when he bestowed the lands upon one of his followers, Hamon de Masci, who became the first Baron of Dunham Massey. Since then the estate has been under the ownership of just three families: the Davenports, De Bromales and Nevills. In 1936, the timber-framed hall and its surrounding parkland was handed over to the local council. The transformation followed a £1.6m grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund and £400,000 in council funding.	A Tudor manor house has reopened following a £2.2m makeover.
Work was due to begin this week on demolishing Prestatyn Community Hospital which closed two years ago. But now National Resources Wales has ruled that because seagulls are nesting on the roof, the demolition must be put on hold until the chicks have  flown. Developers Pure Residential and Commercial have bought the site and lodged plans for apartments and houses.	Seagulls have come to the aid of campaigners fighting to save a former hospital from immediate demolition.
The US Navy said on 8 April that the Carl Vinson strike group was travelling to the Korean peninsula amid tensions over Pyongyang's nuclear ambitions. Last week President Trump said an "armada" was being sent. But the group was actually farther away over the weekend, moving through the Sunda Strait into the Indian Ocean. The US military's Pacific Command said on Tuesday that it had cancelled a port visit to Perth, but had completed previously scheduled training with Australia off its northwest coast after departing Singapore on 8 April. The strike group was now "proceeding to the Western Pacific as ordered". It is not clear whether the failure to arrive was a deliberate deception, perhaps designed to frighten North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un, a change of plan or simple miscommunication, the BBC's Korea correspondent Stephen Evans says. Either way, US Vice-President Mike Pence was undeterred as he spoke aboard the USS Ronald Reagan - an aircraft carrier docked in Japan - during his tour of the region, vowing to "defeat any attack and meet any use of conventional or nuclear weapons with an overwhelming and effective American response". North Korea and the US have ratcheted up tensions in recent weeks and the movement of the strike group had raised the question of a pre-emptive strike by the US. On Wednesday, Mr Pence described the country as the "most dangerous and urgent threat to peace and security" in the Asia-Pacific. His words came after the North held a show of military might in a parade over the weekend and tested another missile on Sunday, which blew up almost immediately after launch, the Pentagon said. The US also accused North Korea of trying to "provoke something", with US Defence Secretary James Mattis calling the test a reckless move on Tuesday. He said the US was "working closely" with China to engage North Korea. Pyongyang said it may test missiles on a weekly basis, and warned of "all-out war" if the US takes military action. "If the US is planning a military attack against us, we will react with a nuclear pre-emptive strike by our own style and method," Vice-Foreign Minister Han Song-ryol told the BBC on Monday.

Matsuyama shot a six-under 66 in the last round of the WGC-HSBC Champions to finish seven clear of Sweden's Henrik Stenson and American Daniel Berger. His 29 birdies at Sheshan International was three short of the PGA Tour record. Finishing on 23 under par, his total was also just one shot off the 72-hole record score at the Chinese course. The win will lift Matsuyama to a career-high sixth in the world rankings. Northern Irishman McIlroy carded a 66 to finish tied with American Bill Haas and will move up one place to second when the rankings are published on Monday. Scotland's defending champion Russell Knox fell away in the final round, shooting a two-over-par 74 to end up ninth alongside Spaniard Sergio Garcia. Englishmen Ross Fisher, Paul Casey and Matthew Fitzpatrick all posted final rounds of under 70 to finish seventh, 12th and 16th respectively.

In a White House news conference, Mr Obama also said he "absolutely" has concerns about the president-elect. But he called on his fellow Democrats to accept the result and "recognise that that is how democracy works". Mr Obama declined to comment on Mr Trump's pick of controversial conservative figure Steve Bannon as his White House chief strategist. Speaking of his meeting last week at the White House with Mr Trump, Mr Obama said: "I emphasised to him that, look, in an election like this that was so hotly contested and so divided, gestures matter. Trump and Putin 'to mend ties' Kremlin says Trump presidency: Your questions answered "I did say to him, as I've said publicly, that because of the nature of the campaign and the bitterness and ferocity of the campaigns, it's really important to try to send some signals of unity, and to reach out to minority groups or women or others that were concerned about the tenor of the campaign." Mr Obama said of their Oval Office meeting: "We had a very cordial conversation. Do I have concerns? Absolutely." It was only a week ago that the nation's first black president was describing Mr Trump as "woefully unprepared for the job". But during last Thursday's White House meeting, Mr Obama said his successor had "expressed a great interest in maintaining our core strategic relationships". He said this included "strong and robust Nato" partnerships, which he said would convey "enormous continuity" to the world. Mr Trump on Monday spoke on the phone with Russian President Vladimir Putin, the Kremlin announced, and both agreed their countries' relations were "extremely unsatisfactory". Mr Trump's appointment of Mr Bannon, editor of the right-wing media outlet Breitbart News, as his senior advisor in the West Wing has stirred controversy. But Mr Obama told reporters it would "not be fair of me to comment on every appointment that the president-elect starts making". "It's only been six days," said Mr Obama. "I think it will be important for him to have the room, to staff up. "There are certain things that make for good soundbites, but don't make for good policy." He added: "Campaigning is different from governing - I think he recognises that." Mr Obama predicted "there are going to be certain elements of his temperament that will not serve him well unless he recognises them and corrects them. "Because when you're a candidate and you say something that is inaccurate or controversial it has less impact than it does when you're president of the United States." Mr Trump has also named Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus as his chief of staff, a relatively uncontroversial pick. Who is Trump's chief strategist?

President Barack Obama has urged Donald Trump to send "some signals of unity" after the US election campaign.
He reiterated that he wanted to bring high-speed broadband - which he defined as greater than 24 Megabits per second - to more than 90% of the country. Mr Hunt outlined the ambition in a speech at Google's Campus building in east London. His comments followed heavy criticism last month from a Lords committee which said plans were too focused on speed. The report from the communications committee said Mr Hunt's ambitions were "misguided" and left "a very real risk that some people and businesses are being left behind, that inadequate access to the internet and all its benefits is actually afflicting their daily lives". On Monday, Mr Hunt defended his focus on higher speeds, which he said would be needed in order for the UK's network to remain competitive with others in Europe. "We simply will not have a competitive broadband network unless we recognise the massive growth in demand for higher and higher speeds," Mr Hunt said. "Today's superfast is tomorrow's superslow. Just as the last government was wrong to hang its hat on 2Mbps speeds, we must never fall into the trap of saying any speed is 'enough'." He said the government had begun looking at the ways it will allocate part of a Â£300m slice of the television licence fee to provide high-speed broadband to a greater number than the existing target of 90% of the country. Initially, much of this speed increase will be achieved by a Fibre To The Cabinet (FTTC) system, in which high-speed fibre cabling is connected to a cabinet near a user's home. Internet data will then travel the final distance through copper cabling, which is slower. The possible connection speed available via FTTC decreases as it travels further away from the cabinet. Because of this issue, Mr Hunt said FTTC will only be a temporary measure. "The reason we are backing Fibre To The Cabinet as a potential medium-term solution is simple: The increase in speeds that it allows - 80 Mbps certainly but in certain cases up to 1 gigabit - will comfortably create Europe's biggest and most profitable high-speed broadband market," he said. "And in doing so we will create the conditions whereby, if fibre to the home is still the best way to get the very highest speeds, private sector companies will invest to provide it." Fibre To the Home (FTTH) allows a fibre-speed connection to reach individual homes without the need for slower copper cabling. By 2016, he said up to two-thirds of the country will be able to access Fibre To The Home (FTTH) Labour has criticised Mr Hunt's speech, suggesting that it lacked clear detail about how the ambitions were to be met. "Today was a chance for Jeremy Hunt to articulate a coherent vision of what Britain's broadband infrastructure should look like," shadow culture minister Helen Goodman said. "He boldly declared that Britain will have the fastest broadband network in Europe but then offered no plan as to how he will make this happen. "Under this government, millions of people will have to wait at least three more years for a broadband connection than they would have with Labour's plans. "No amount of fast-talk from Jeremy Hunt will disguise this government's lack of a coherent plan for growth."	The UK will have the fastest broadband of any major European country by 2015, Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt has said.
Yes - and no. According to Glastonbury organisers, it's the first time sustainable, recycled stainless steel pint cups have been used on such a major scale, so it's nice to be able to be one of the first people to get their mitts on one. However, they don't have a logo or any other identifying "Glastonbury" mark, so you'd have to be happy in the knowledge that only you and fellow-revellers know the significance of the beaker. Maybe in future years there will be an identifying stamp - and full-on collecting will be possible. If that's the case, having one of the first ones could be invaluable. Good news for people with metallaphobia - they're not compulsory. In fact, they're only available at 10 of the main bars - overall there are hundreds of food and drink stands. It depends what you plan to do with them. If you want to partake in the unpleasant age-old festival tradition of urinating into cups and hurling them at the band, you'll find that although strong, they're difficult to throw very far. They don't have lids, and are an awkward and non-aerodynamic shape to throw, with the contents likely to leave the vessel well before reaching your intended target. The real danger comes from full bottles with the top still on. A litre bottle of water weighs 1kg (about 2.25lb), and hurled at a head can pack a powerful punch. That's why so many venues insist on removing the plastic cap when selling bottles of liquid. Baby-faced pop phenomenon Justin Bieber, sensitive northern warbler Morrissey, and ladies' boy Harry Styles have all faced missiles filled by micturating merrymakers. Of course, for people stumbling back to their tents, treading on a discarded metal cup is more likely to lead to a sprained ankle than mashing a plastic or paper one. But the £5 deposit might encourage people hang on to them. It shouldn't do. The cups are made from food grade stainless steel. According to beer appreciation group Beer Advocate, stainless steel is fine - after all, beer kegs are made from the same material. The metals to avoid are copper - which can react with the brew, and pewter - which can affect the taste. Also, antique pewter goblets tend to contain lead, which is poisonous. People with amalgam fillings should have no trouble with drinking from stainless steel cups, says the British Dental Association. Not on its own - although it's a nice nod towards that. But Glastonbury organiser Michael Eavis has high hopes his idea will get the ball rolling. "For me, the single most important thing was being able to source British stainless steel for the cups from the place where it was invented - Sheffield, and then to take it on to the home of manufacture - Birmingham," he says. "If the jobs, skills and infrastructure [in British steel] are lost they won't be replaced. We've worked on this project over the last three years, which will hopefully encourage other UK businesses to think about how they can support our steel industry during these very challenging times." Remember though, the Glastonbury cups are made from 80% recycled steel. One of the high-profile troubled steel works is at Port Talbot in south Wales, which produces slab, hot rolled, cold rolled and galvanised coil. Which is new steel. The festival's green initiatives and sustainability coordinator Lucy Smith says: "For us, using these cups is part of the reusable revolution. It's very similar to paying 5p for a carrier bag. We think people will take to it. "The pints are made by APS in Birmingham, and it was a significant part of the project to have them made with British stainless steel." Steelwork does produce pollutants - Tata Steel says particulate material, sulphur dioxide and oxides of nitrogen are emissions the company monitors. But the production of plastic glasses also releases toxins including trichloroethane, acetone, methylene chloride and benzene. Plus - plastics are very stable and therefore stay in the environment a long time after they are thrown away, especially if they are shielded from direct sunlight by being buried in landfills.	As the Glastonbury Festival announces revellers are to be provided with steel drinking cups, BBC News looks at some of the questions being asked about giving bacchanalian band-lovers metal beakers.
Mr Anderson was diagnosed 18 months ago but has spoken about it publicly for the first time for an Alzheimer's Society walk launch on Thursday. The 83-year-old, who lives in Henley-on-Thames, said of living with the condition: "I've lost my freedom." Thunderbirds was filmed on Slough Trading Estate in Berkshire and was first broadcast in 1965. Speaking on BBC Berkshire he said: "I don't think I realised at all. It was my wife Mary who began to notice that I would do something quite daft like putting the kettle in the sink and waiting for it to boil. "Finally I was persuaded to go and see the doctor and eventually I was confronted with the traditional test - a piece of paper with drawings on it, taking a pencil and copying them. "I thought 'Why are they doing this? A child could do this'. "But when I started to copy the drawings, that wasn't the case. What is Alzheimer's Disease? "I started to get in a muddle. That's when I began to realise that there was something wrong." Mr Anderson, who also created the marionette puppet series Joe 90 and Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons, said being told he was no longer able to drive "was the bitterest blow of all". "That virtually took away my freedom. It meant that I couldn't go to Pinewood studios where I worked, and this depressed me enormously because my film work was my life. "Suddenly my life was cut off. Since I've had Alzheimer's I've realised how debilitating it is. It can affect your life in so many ways that you don't think about." Mr Anderson was diagnosed with Alzheimer's in early 2010 but his son Jamie said the family noticed recurring symptoms "five or six years ago". "Little things like losing his way on car journeys he's done for 20 years or more, using very strange ingredients when making soups, struggling to dial numbers," he said. "We look with hindsight now and we see symptoms that were recurring five or six years ago and if we'd bitten the bullet and dealt with it then perhaps it would have been different." Mr Anderson will be taking part in the Windsor Memory Walk with Jamie on 13 October in support of the Alzheimer's Society, which is encouraging people to sign up for the walks that will take place around England. Alzheimer's Society chief executive Jeremy Hughes said: "We're so grateful to Gerry for supporting Memory Walk. "By speaking out about his dementia he's spreading the message much further that it can happen to anyone."	The creator of Thunderbirds, Gerry Anderson, has revealed he has Alzheimer's Disease.

Media playback is not supported on this device World number one Selby, the 2014 champion, looked impressive as he went 3-0 ahead with half-century breaks in frames two and three. Hong Kong's Fu hit back with a 72, and the pair shared four frames after the mid-session interval. China's Ding Junhui leads Alan McManus 6-2 in the other semi-final. Both Ding and Fu are hoping to become the first Asian player to win the sport's showpiece event. But Fu's chances appear fainter than Ding's after a characteristically dogged effort by Leicester's Selby in the best-of-33 contest. World number 14 Fu began anxiously, perhaps affected by the late jitters that saw him surrender a 9-1 lead in his 13-11 win over Barry Hawkins. Selby won a scrappy opener in which both men wasted a couple of chances, and he also took the second frame with a diligent 56. At 3-0 behind Fu made the most of a decent opening to score a well-constructed 72 before pinching a thrilling fifth frame full of incredible escapes, missed chances and numerous flukes. A 31-minute frame then went Selby's way for him to lead to 4-2 before they shared the final two frames, Fu with a fluent 89 and Selby scoring 69. Fu fought back impressively to keep alive his chances of going one better than Thailand's James Wattana - the first player from Asia to reach the last four at the Crucible. In 1993, the same year as the first of Wattana's two appearances, McManus graced that stage of the event for the second time But, 23 years on, the veteran Scot's hopes of progressing further look slim. Ding was in intimidating form from the start, opening with a break of 100 and scoring two further tons and two half-centuries to go 5-0 up. McManus, at 45, the oldest man to reach a Crucible semi-final since Ray Reardon in 1985, had scored just 47 points. But he showed his tactical nous to win two lengthy frames and get back to 5-2, before Ding ended with a 128. McManus did little wrong in the first five frames, but had every minor mistake punished by the world number 17. Ding had to win three qualifying rounds to reach this stage, but seems to have benefited from the extra table time. The 29-year-old has looked increasingly sharp, and has stayed fresh thanks to his fluent form which earned him an extra day's rest for beating Mark Williams inside two sessions in the quarter-finals. John Parrott, 1991 world champion: "Ding was superb. His break building and his match play has been fantastic. But I think he needed to win the last frame. The way he dominated the session, if he hadn't come out of it at least 6-2 he would have been kicking himself."	Mark Selby made the most of a tentative start by Marco Fu to build a 5-3 lead in the opening session of their World Championship semi-final.
There were also celebrations for Bayern Munich, while Zlatan Ibrahimovic was lauded in Paris and Gonzalo Higuain broke a long-standing Serie A scoring record. But what else happened in Europe this weekend as further champions were crowned and others didn't have it quite as good? BBC Sport rounds up the stories you might have missed. Club Brugge are Belgian champions for the first time in 11 years thanks to a 4-0 hammering of title rivals Anderlecht. There are still two games to go in the play-off system used to determine the title winners. But Brugge's victory on Sunday means Michel Preud'homme's side are now six points clear and, thanks to finishing top of the regular-season standings, cannot be overhauled. Top scorer Abdoulay Diaby scored twice within five minutes in the first half, before Hans Vanaken and Timmy Simons added goals after the break to spark Brugge's title celebrations. Benfica secured a third successive Portuguese title as they held off the challenge of Lisbon rivals Sporting on a fluctuating final day. The defending champions were two points ahead of Sporting going into Sunday's closing round of games. Sporting threatened to take the title thanks to a better head-to-head record after they scored their opening goal in a 4-0 win over Braga to go top of the table briefly. But that situation lasted just three minutes as Benfica then went in front against Nacional through captain Nicolas Gaitan, before going on to complete a 4-1 victory. Jonas scored the second goal to take the Brazilian's total for the season to 32 as he finished as the league's leading scorer. Gaitan added the third and Pizzi the fourth as Benfica, who at one point trailed Sporting by eight points, secured the title with a record number of points and club record total of 87 goals for an 18-team division. Besiktas are the new Turkish champions after they sealed their first title since 2009 with a 3-1 win over Osmanlispor. Their victory keeps them six points clear of second-placed Fenerbahce, who beat Genclerbirligi 2-1, with one game to go in Turkey's Super League. Germany international Mario Gomez, 30, fittingly led Besiktas to their 14th championship success as the league's leading scorer added his 26th goal of the season. On-loan defender Marcelo had earlier scored twice for Besiktas, who last month moved into a new 42,000-seater stadium. Stuttgart has enjoyed better days than the finale of the regular season in Germany as the city suffered three relegations. The senior team - three times Bundesliga champions - ended a 39-year stay in the top flight as they were relegated. It also spelled the end of head coach Jurgen Kramny's spell in charge. Kramny, 44, replaced Michael Zorniger in November, but will revert to his former job as coach of the reserves, who finished bottom of the German third division. They therefore drop into regional football, along with Stuttgart Kickers, who were relegated after finishing third from bottom of the third tier. Steven Fletcher hasn't pulled up many trees in France but marked what may be his last Ligue 1 game for Marseille in eventful fashion as he scored and missed a penalty. Fletcher's loan move from Sunderland was one of the more surprising January transfer deals and the Scot made an early impression with a cup goal on his first start. That was it, though, until the former Hibernian, Burnley and Wolves striker, 29, claimed his first league goal in his 12th appearance in a 1-1 draw at bottom club Troyes in Saturday's final round of league fixtures. There was to be no happy ending as Fletcher then missed a spot-kick inside the last 10 minutes, but he has a chance of salvation and a possible big finish in next weekend's Coupe de France final against Paris St-Germain, who are seeking to complete a domestic treble. Sevilla obviously enjoy their trips around Europe, if not across Spain. Unai Emery's side will be bidding to win the Europa League for the third year running when they face Liverpool in the final in Basel on Wednesday night. Sevilla therefore played a weakened team for their final La Liga fixture on Saturday and lost 3-1 at Athletic Bilbao, meaning they finished the season without a single away league win. Timothee Kolodziejczak was sent off as Sevilla finished the season in seventh place, with their Copa del Rey final against Barcelona to come next Sunday. At the bottom of La Liga, Sporting Gijon saved themselves on the final day as they beat fourth-placed Villarreal 2-0. That meant Getafe, beaten 2-1 at Real Betis, went down with Rayo Vallecano and Levante. A running sideshow of Italian football this season has been the "will he stay or will he go?" saga of Roma legend Francesco Totti's future. The former Italy international, 39, is out of contract this summer after 23 years at the Stadio Olimpico. Totti has been a bit-part player under Luciano Spalletti as Roma finished third in Serie A. But reports in Italy suggest Roma's record appearance maker has been offered a new deal. "We have offered Totti another year's contract as a player," Roma director Mauro Baldissoni is quoted as saying in the Italian media. So... is Totti staying? "We're waiting for a response," Baldissoni reportedly said. "He'll want to think about it." On the pitch, Palermo secured their Serie A survival with a final-day 3-2 win over bottom club Hellas Verona. Carpi's 2-1 victory at Udinese was therefore not enough to give them a second season in Italy's top flight. Elsewhere, Miroslav Klose marked his final game for Lazio by scoring a penalty in his side's 4-2 home defeat by Fiorentina. The Germany international, 37, leaves after scoring 60 goals during his five seasons in Rome.	Barcelona kept Real Madrid at bay to retain the La Liga title as silverware was dished out around Europe.
Twelve homes were evacuated after the hole opened in Ripon, North Yorkshire, at 22:30 GMT on Wednesday. The hole measured about 20m (66ft) by 10m (33ft) and 9m (30ft) deep. The BGS said Ripon lies in one of the most susceptible areas of the UK for sinkholes because of its "Permian gypsum deposits". It said these can dissolve more quickly than surrounding limestone, leading to the enlargement of underground caves. Experts are still examining data from the site behind the houses in Magdalen's Road but, releasing its initial findings, the BGS said sinkholes were often caused by surface water penetrating the ground, or fluctuations in groundwater levels. In 2014, a 100-year-old detached house in an adjoining street was demolished after a 25ft-wide (8m) sinkhole opened. According to the report, the wider area of Ripon periodically encounters sinkholes and in the 1980s and 1990s a hole was appearing every two to three years. No-one was injured in the latest collapse with the back gardens of two properties the worst affected. A sewerage system connected to several of the properties on the terrace fell in as the hole appeared. One resident described seeing the ground moving and finding her steps leading into the garden had gone. On Friday, further cracks appeared in the ground and on walls at the site. Ben Cairns, North Yorkshire Fire Service station manager, said: "Our main concern at the moment is what impact the weather is going to have for the next few days." The BGS is continuing to analyse data from the site.	A large hole that appeared behind a row of houses was in one of the UK's most susceptible areas for sinkholes, the British Geological Survey has said.
The boy is from Northern Ireland, but his family do not want him to be named to protect his identity. His mother had to give up her job to look after him. In June, his parents made the difficult decision to remove him from mainstream schooling because he was not coping. They requested a place for him at a special school but are still waiting. In September, the family was told that all the special schools in the South Eastern Education Board area were full to capacity and no time frame could be given as to when a place would become available. The boy's mother told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme that her son does not understand why his brother and sister are able to go to school but he is not. "He really misses being around people, he doesn't like being isolated, but unfortunately the way the system has been working so far has actually worked to isolate him more," she said. The family has now been told that an extra classroom assistant has been employed at a local special school and the hope is that their son will be able to start there in the next few weeks. However, the boy's mother is worried that this same situation will happen to other families as the special needs school system is packed to capacity. "The schools are being put in the position where they have a family like us who desperately require a place in the school, but they really have no capacity there because the school is already over-subscribed." The BBC asked the Education Authority for a response to the concerns the family has raised but its spokesperson said they could not comment on individual cases. "As we have a duty to protect the privacy rights of the child, it would be unacceptable to publicly discuss their specific and highly sensitive needs", they said. In relation to special school provision in general, they said the Education Authority was "currently reviewing the profile of need for special school places in Northern Ireland and is endeavouring to ensure that places are available close to where the children reside". "This work is ongoing and is designed to assist with the placement of children with effect from 2016," the spokesperson added.	A nine-year-old boy with autism has been unable to go to school for three months because all the special schools in the area near his home are full.
The 28-year-old was arrested following an investigation by the Queensland Crime and Corruption Commission (CCC). Two other men and a woman were also charged with supplying cocaine for "personal use or to on-supply cocaine to friends and colleagues". Hunt has played elite-level rugby league, Australian rules football (AFL) and rugby union. Hunt - who is due to appear in Southport Magistrate Court on 5 March - was not named by the CCC but local media have named him as the 28-year old man arrested. He was arrested on Thursday night, just days after playing for the Queensland Reds rugby team. "The CCC will allege that during an investigation focused on a cocaine trafficking syndicate operating in South East Queensland, these four individuals were identified contacting the syndicate and arranging for the supply of cocaine," a statement said. It is alleged the offences occurred between June and December 2014 when Hunt was playing AFL for the Gold Coast Suns. Hunt rose to prominence playing fullback for the Brisbane Broncos rugby league team in 2004, and was selected for Queensland State of Origin and Australian representative squads. He made a code-switch to AFL with the Gold Coast Suns in 2009. Hunt played with the team until 2014 when he made a switch to rugby union. Facing charges with Hunt are a 24-year-old man from Burleigh Waters, a 27-year-old man from Mermaid Waters and a 22-year-old woman from Mermaid Waters.	Australian rugby union star Karmichael Hunt has been charged with supplying cocaine, officials say.
Were you in Nepal when the earthquake struck? It is nearly one year since a massive earthquake hit Kathmandu and its surrounding areas, killing thousands of people.

But the design, for a new apartment complex in South Korea, has sparked a furious response from critics who say it resembles the collapse of New York's World Trade Center after the 9/11 attacks. The design, by a Dutch architectural company, is part of a flagship project to develop a major new site in central Seoul. The PR chief at the Yongsan Development Company, Seo Hee-seok, said the accusation was a shock. "When I heard that, I was totally surprised, and bewildered," he told me. "It felt like something out of a novel.  And because this is just one of many buildings in the new development, I even wondered whether it was a conspiracy." The symbolism and spiritual impact of buildings is important in South Korea. Feng shui experts are often consulted on the best possible position of a new construction, and just a few years ago, the vast front gate to Seoul's main Gyeongbok palace was moved and rotated, to erase changes made by Korea's former Japanese colonial rulers. Mr Seo says this latest dispute is not a matter of insensitivity but of different cultural perceptions. "If I'd been living in New York at that time, and been part of that experience," he says, "I might agree it looked like it. But to me, at the moment, it doesn't resemble the World Trade Centre attacks at all." On the streets of Seoul, though, some people do make the connection. "Even if it does remind people of 9/11, there's no law saying it can't be built," one man told me. "It might even remind people of the tragedy that happened back then." "I know there's been some criticism of this," another commuter said, "because it looks like the 9/11 attacks, but in my view it's a piece of architecture and I don't think there's a problem with it - I think it's a fantastic design." The development company say they were offered two versions of the design. The chaotic pixelated style was chosen because it was seen as "trendy". A second version, with a smooth, undulating bridge snaking round the two buildings was dismissed as "too old-fashioned". The design will not be finalised until next year, with construction due to begin in 2013. But as of now, the company says there has been no decision to alter their plans to appease the critics.	It is what developers are calling a "pixelated cloud" - a profusion of box-like extensions jutting out from the middle of two tower blocks, and fusing them together.
The event at the University of Wolverhampton Sports Complex in Walsall will feature a number of Rio 2016 Paralympic medallists. It will be the first opportunity for judoka to pick up world ranking points in the Tokyo 2020 cycle. Great Britain last hosted the Europeans in 2011 in Crawley. Judo for blind and visually-impaired athletes is similar to the sighted sport, but fighters start the bouts gripped up. The competition will be followed by a three-day training camp giving athletes the opportunity to train alongside some of Britain's best sighted judoka at the British Judo Centre of Excellence. "It's brilliant that we'll have the chance to fight in front of a home crowd at a major international event this year," said Hull fighter Chris Skelley, who came fifth in the -100kg category at the Rio Paralympics. Fighting in Rio last year we all saw how important home support was for the Brazilian players and I think it will make a big difference to us. "It's a really important stepping stone on the road to Tokyo."	Britain will host the 2017 International Blind Sports Federation (IBSA) European Judo Championships from Thursday 3 to Sunday 6 August.
The head of football's governing body outlined his vision for an expanded tournament comprising 16 groups of three teams earlier this month. The top two teams in each group would progress to the knockout rounds. A decision will be made in January but any change to the 32-team format is unlikely to come in before 2026. Fifa's council will discuss the proposal at a meeting on 9 January but Infantino, 46, made expansion part of his election manifesto. "We have to be more inclusive," he said at a sports conference in Dubai, adding that a 48-team tournament was the most financially appealing. "If we can have a format that does not add any additional matches but brings so much joy to those who don't have the chance to participate then we will have to think about that," Infantino said. "When discussed with the associations in the summits they were overwhelmingly in favour, but more discussions will have to take place." The number of competing teams at World Cups last changed in 1998, increasing from 24 to 32. The European Club Association, which represents the region's leading clubs, has rejected calls for the World Cup to be expanded. Infantino also said experiments around video technology in refereeing at the recent Club World Cup had been "very positive" and that he hoped the system would be used at the 2018 World Cup in Russia. The system was first used to award a penalty in Kashima Antlers' semi-final win over Atletico Nacional, with the referee alerted by an assistant watching a monitor. But there was confusion in the other semi-final between Real Madrid and Club America when the technology was used again. After the referee asked for a consultation following a Cristiano Ronaldo goal, play briefly restarted from a free-kick for an infringement before the goal was eventually allowed to stand. Infantino said tests in Japan had moved the system in "the right direction" but added "there is still a bit of fine-tuning to be made". Richard Conway, BBC Radio 5 live sports news correspondent Gianni Infantino may well have "overwhelming" support for Fifa's 48-country World Cup plan - but it is not universal. The European Clubs Association - which represents the biggest teams on the continent - is opposed. European teams provide 80% of the players to a World Cup so they are a significant stakeholder and will place pressure on Uefa. Uefa is still to make its position clear but other confederations are likely to welcome an expanded tournament. European nations take up a big proportion of the current 32 slots at the World Cup. Given there's no chance of any redistribution taking place, Fifa see an expanded World Cup as a way to appease many of its 211 members who miss out on the party. It also fulfils one of Infantino's key presidential manifesto pledges. Uefa may in the end go along with the 48-country plan given the likely support from the rest of the world. But it will likely want more of its countries to qualify too. Let the horse-trading begin.	Global football federations are "overwhelmingly in favour" of plans for a 48-team World Cup, Fifa president Gianni Infantino says.
Seventeen-year-old Sylvia Fleming was pregnant when she was murdered in Omagh in 1998 by Stephen Scott. He was sentenced to life, but has been taking part in a pre-release scheme. The prison service said the Victim Information Scheme (PRVIS) gives victims an opportunity to provide and receive information about prisoners. Miss Fleming went missing in April 1998. Her body parts were found under the foundations of a partially-built house eight weeks later. Sentencing Scott in 2000, the judge described him as "thoroughly evil". He said: "The manner in which her body was disposed of after her murder is surely the most gruesome. "I am satisfied that you, Scott, not only deliberately killed this young girl but that you planned that killing and carried it out in circumstances so squalid that they would revolt any right-thinking person." Her sister, Josie Fleming, told BBC Radio Foyle she was contacted by someone who had spotted the killer painting a fence. "Even though we knew the time was coming we are angry and fearful," she said. "They need to let us know when he is due for his official release - it's important for us to know when this evil person will be free to walk the streets." Miss Fleming said she believes Scott is "capable of anything" and should never be freed. "He took her into his flat, he tied her up in a bed and put a blindfold over her eyes and covered her mouth with tape," Ms Fleming said. "He injected her with insulin and when she passed away he put her in the attic and then took her down and put her in the bath to cut her up." "You never can come to terms with what happened, we're learning to live with it but we'll never, ever get over it." In a statement, the prison service said those who register with the Victim Information Scheme will get details about a person convicted of a crime against them. They will receive details about any temporary release a prisoner is granted,  the month and year in which a prisoner is expected to be released, any conditions of the prisoner's release and any breaches of those conditions which result in the prisoner's return to custody. In the case of life-sentence prisoners, the victim can obtain information about the minimum number of years the life prisoner must serve, when the life prisoner is being considered for release and have the opportunity to give views when the prisoner is considered for final release.	The sister of a teenager who was murdered, cut up and buried by her boyfriend says she is afraid after discovering he has been out of prison.
But the Frenchman's situation remains "challenging" and the 25-year-old is in a critical but stable condition. Earlier, Bianchi's father Philippe had described the situation as "desperate". "Every time the telephone goes, we know it could be the hospital to tell us that Jules is dead," he said. "He will not give up, I'm sure of that. I can see it. I believe it." He added in an interview with Italian newspaper La Gazzetta dello Sport: "I speak to him. I know he can hear me. "His doctors have told us that this is already a miracle, no-one has ever survived such a serious accident. But Jules won't give up. "His trainer Andrea says that if there is one person who can make it happen with his will, it's Jules." Philippe said the family had been touched by the show of support from other Formula 1 drivers, who gathered at the front of the grid before the Russian Grand Prix, arms around each other's shoulders, forming a 'circle of solidarity' for Jules. "I've never seen anything like that," Philippe said. "It touched us very deeply. We thank every one of them. So many of them have been in touch, written to me; [Fernando] Alonso, [Jean-Eric] Vergne, [Felipe] Massa have given strong messages. "[Lewis] Hamilton wrote me a beautiful email in which he says that if there is anything he can do, he's there. [Valentino] Rossi and [Marc] Marquez from Moto GP too." Philippe also said he is using the accident of seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher, who continues his recovery at home after suffering a head injury in a skiing accident in December, as a reference point. "I was very sad when he got hurt," Philippe said. "I kept wondering, like every one else 'Why don't they tell us more about how he is?'. "But now I'm in the same position I understand. Everyone keeps asking me how Jules is but I can't reply, there is no answer. It's very serious but he's stable. "One day he seems a bit better, other days a bit worse. The doctors don't say. The damage from the accident is very bad but we don't know how it will evolve. "Even with Schumacher it took months to come out of the coma. [FIA president] Jean Todt said he hopes Michael will one day be able to have a normal life. One day I hope we can say the same about Jules." He added: "It's tough. In a week the life of this family has been destroyed. What are we doing here? Living a nightmare in a place very far from home. "But when Jules gets a bit better we can transfer him, maybe to Tokyo and things will be a bit easier. But who knows when that will happen. If it will happen. We have no certainties, we just have to wait."	Marussia's Jules Bianchi has faced "a number of medical challenges" after sustaining severe head injuries in a crash at the Japanese Grand Prix, his team and family said in a statement.
Dal Babu, a chief superintendent until 2013, said many Muslims did not trust the "Prevent" strategy and many saw it as a form of spying. Prevent is a multi-agency programme which aims to stop people being drawn into terrorist-related activity. The Home Office defended the scheme, saying 130,000 people had been trained to identify and prevent extremism. With an annual budget of Â£40m, the Prevent programme is one of four strands of Contest, the acronym given to the government's multi-pronged counter-terrorism strategy. The Home Office says there are now Prevent programmes in place in all key sectors, including local government, health, education, prisons, immigration and charities. But Mr Babu, who retired from the Metropolitan Police two years ago, said cases like those of the three London schoolgirls who have gone to Syria had caught the authorities unaware. He said because police counter-terrorism units were mainly white, with few Muslim officers, they did not fully understand issues of race, Islam and gender. He said: "Sadly, Prevent has become a toxic brand and most Muslims are suspicious of what Prevent is doing." He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "Prevent, when it was introduced, was a good idea. It is about engagement of local communities. "But over the years it has become less and less trusted. "Cameras were implemented, without the community understanding them, in Muslim areas of Birmingham." Mr Babu, a highly respected figure in policing circles, helped found the National Association of Muslim Police during a 30-year career in which he became one of the most senior Asian officers in the UK. He said that organisations who have taken Prevent funding have a considerable credibility gap within the Muslim community. "A lot of public money is given to organisations that say they can stop extremism, but we don't know if they are successful. "You need a strategy for dealing with extremism. But how is that strategy measured, has it been successful? "We should not put Muslims in a separate box when safeguarding young people. "You need to look at children services. There is also a spectacular lack of diversity in hierarchy of  children services. "They are all white. I am not aware of a single non-white chair of an independent safeguarding board. "In diverse areas like Manchester, Birmingham, Thames Valley, London and Yorkshire you need to make sure you have services that reflect the community." Sir Peter Fahy, Chief Constable of Greater Manchester Police defended the Prevent strategy, saying: "Overall it has been a very successful programme. "If you ask the Muslim communities whether they have confidence in policing, they have a higher confidence in policing than the mainstream population [does]." "It's very difficult to measure the success of a programme that's about prevention because obviously the success rate here is that no bombs have gone off." He said that parents had to take "prime responsibility" for stopping young people being attracted by Islamic State. He added: "But there is a recognition that the Muslim leaders themselves have allowed too many extremists to take the ground. They are the prime people that need to find a solution to this." Mizahur Rahman, who underwent a deradicalisation programme after serving a prison term for soliciting to murder, told the BBC that the Prevent programme was never going to work as there was an atmosphere of fear and intimidation. He told BBC Radio 5 live on Friday: "The Prevent mentors, deradicalisers or whatever you want to call them, are going to be seen as agents of the government, intelligence gatherers. "There is no way to have a trusting relationship with someone in that position. "I never felt comfortable at all, despite what they said. I felt if I asked him something I would go to prison." The Home Office spokesperson defended the programme in a statement: "This Government fundamentally revised the Prevent strategy in 2011 to ensure it challenges terrorist ideology, supports people who are vulnerable to being drawn into terrorism and works with sectors and institutions where there are risks of radicalisation. "We will soon be coming forward with a new extremism strategy that deals with the whole spectrum of extremism." A Scottish government spokesman said that its programme, run through the Scottish Preventing Violent Extremism Unit, took a different approach, "based on community engagement and the strength of the relationship between our Muslim communities and our police service".	The government's anti-terror strategy has become "a toxic brand", a Muslim former senior police officer has said.
One former worker told BBC Two's Newsnight that staff were told of complaints about a client who sexually exploited girls he met there, off site. But she says these concerns were not passed on and Newsnight has established that authorities were not alerted. The charity said it would have told police of any allegation it knew about. Two witnesses allege complaints were made known to staff at the charity's Urban Academy in Southwark, south-east London, which provides educational support to over-16s with "complex emotional or behavioural needs". The charity's chairman, Alan Yentob, who is also the BBC's creative director, said: "There is no evidence that we were informed about a sexual abuse case. I think this amount of rumour and allegation and counter-allegation… is disgraceful." Before it shut its doors on Wednesday, Kids Company provided practical, emotional and educational support to some of the most deprived and vulnerable inner-city children and young people in London, Liverpool and Bristol. The charity, founded in 1996 by Camila Batmanghelidjh, was well known for its famous and wealthy supporters who included David Cameron, but has been closed amid a row over funding. In addition to the allegations being made to Newsnight, a former client of the charity has told BBC News that, when she was 16, she was touched inappropriately by a 24-year-old man who was also a client of the charity at that time. She said she attempted to tell a teacher at the charity, which provides educational services, but the conversation was stopped before she could explain she had been assaulted. Kate (not her her real name) said the sexual assaults took place over a period of seven months in 2009, and occurred at one Kids Company site. "He would touch me in inappropriate places," she said. "He would have his dirty comments like how he would like to do certain things. I got pushed to the wall once as well when he threatened me and said that if I didn't comply to his wishes then he would get me." Kate explained what happened when she tried to tell a teacher working at the charity what she had been going through. She said she telephoned the teacher and opened the conversation with an explanation that she was being harassed, but the teacher ended the conversation and put the phone down before she could mention the sexual assault allegations. Kate explained that some of those attending Kids Company with her were not "kids" but men in their 20s. "Everyone was way older, they are all adult, not kids, they shouldn't be there. I was intimidated anyway, I felt intimidated by these men," she said. Responding to Kate's claim, Ms Batmanghelidjh said: "I would be very concerned if a staff member turned round and said they can't do anything about it. "I'd be very surprised and if a staff member, one staff member, had done that there were lots of others to go to." Kids Company employs 600 paid staff, as well as working with a pool of about 8,000 volunteers and 500 students. One woman who was a paid employee of the charity in 2009 claimed she was the victim of a sexual assault by a co-worker on a night out. Ella (not her real name) said the man forced his hand into her underwear and had to be pulled away by people around them. She said she reported the incident to the charity, but it was never dealt with properly. Ella said she was promised the accused co-worker would be kept away from Kids Company until Ms Batmanghelidjh had spoken to him, but the next day he was back on site. In emails seen by the BBC, Camilla Batmanghelidjh wrote to Ella: "In relation to ******** and the police, that I would support you 100% and that in this situation you were my priority." However, she also questioned the woman's boundaries, writing: "I'm not excusing *********'s behaviour or saying that your behaviour led to it. I'm merely asking you to be much, much clearer about establishing robust boundaries." Ella said she felt scared that little had been done - and that the man had not been suspended and continued to work at Kids Company. Ella herself reported the sexual assault allegation to police, but chose not to press charges. In the Newsnight investigation, it heard that male clients of the charity's Urban Academy in their 20s had forced young clients - girls aged 16 to 18 - to have sex with them. Referring to one such man, a former employee said: "There'd be repercussions if they didn't… you have to do it, he'd blackmail them." She said the girls were told: "If you don't do it I'll tell them about this, this, this and this. Or [he would] photograph them naked and then threaten to send it around to other people." This employee claims that these allegations had been raised with staff, and she knew of them herself, but said they were not passed on. Newsnight has confirmed that the allegations of coerced sex made by witnesses to the programme were not known to the authorities. A week ago, the Metropolitan Police launched an investigation into Kids Company led by Scotland Yard's child abuse command. Camila Batmanghelidjh has emphatically denied any wrongdoing. She told BBC News: "We've already had lawyers go through the details. "There isn't an allegation that will stand. I'm telling you.  Now.  In 19 years we haven't had a single Child Protection problem in the organisation.   And whenever something is raised with us we immediately report it to the police. " Speaking to Newsnight later, Ms Batmanghelidjh said the allegations of sexual exploitation by Kids Company clients of other clients were brought to the charity's notice for the first time by police recently. She added: "If such a thing had taken place on our premises it would have triggered all our safeguarding procedures. I have absolutely no awareness of it. "And there is no awareness of this incident having taken place at Kids Company premises or brought to Kids Company's attention. We would have totally reported something like that."	The Kids Company charity failed in its handling of allegations of serious incidents, including sexual assaults, former staff have said.
All 42 Scottish clubs discussed league reconstruction on Tuesday, with a 16-team top-flight among the proposals. That is the number of teams in the Czech top division and Fitzel believes young talent would have a greater chance to shine in a bigger league. "I am sure a 16-team league has helped our youth development," he said. Fitzel was involved with the Czech youth teams from 1998 to 2005, and helped bring through the likes of Tomas Rosicky and Petr Cech. After a spell as the national coach of Malta he has returned as technical director and general manager of the Czech Republic national team. Fitzel has overseen improved fortunes at all levels of the game after the country missed on qualification for the 2010 World Cup. Since then, the Czech Republic were quarter-finalists in the 2012 European Championships and finished top of their Euro 2016 qualifying group. "If we did not have a 16-team league and we only had 12, only a few youth players would get a chance," Fitzel told BBC Scotland. "The bigger the league, the more teams are playing at a higher level, and the more young players are getting a chance. The more they play, the more they improve through experience of playing in the top league." From next season, the Czech First League will be ranked nine places above Scotland in the Uefa coefficient rankings, with two teams qualifying for the Champions League qualifiers. However, Fitzel admits a 16-team league does have its pitfalls and they could end up moving in the opposite direction. "Currently here in the Czech Republic we are discussing maybe having 10 or 12 teams playing each other four times," Fitzel said. "At the moment we do not play enough games. "A 16-team league has allowed us to have a winter break of two-and-a-half months. We finish at the end of December and start again at the beginning of March. But it means we only play 14 games in spring and all the clubs are saying we should have more games. "In a smaller league, maybe there are more interesting games. We are looking at the ice hockey league, where right now they have play-offs and the stadia there is sold-out; even the relegation play-offs. That's fantastic income for the clubs and the stadiums hold 13,000 - 15,000 people." Fitzel, like many in Europe, has looked on with interest at the Scottish game in the last few years. He says the 12-12-18 set-up that was proposed in 2013 was interesting, but feels clubs should listen to what the supporters want. "It's an interesting idea," he added. "It is something new, and I always feel if you don't try it then you don't know. "From my point of view it is interesting to play for relegation or promotion. It could be a long period of games. "It seems interesting, but the question is do the people want to see this? "If you have enough teams for a 16 top division, they don't need to be equal. Obviously in Scotland you have two big teams, though now there is a problem with Rangers playing out-with the top tier, but still there is two or three dominant teams."	Scottish football should consider a bigger league to help young talent, according to Czech Republic director of football Dusan Fitzel.
Winners of the cup competition earn a place in the Europa League. Four-time cup winners Forest have failed to progress past the third round for the past 11 seasons and start their campaign at Doncaster on Tuesday. "It's very important because it is the only way to go into the Europa League," Montanier told BBC Radio Nottingham. "I know it's difficult because there are a lot of teams from the Premier League and Championship. It will be a very important game." Forest, two-time European Cup winners under Brian Clough in 1979 and 1980, who also guided the club to its four League Cup titles, last featured in European competition in the 1995-96 season, reaching the Uefa Cup quarter-finals. The Reds, who last won the League Cup in 1990 and featured in the final in 1992, were knocked out of the competition by League One side Walsall 12 months ago. Their trip to face League Two side Doncaster comes three days after Montanier oversaw Forest's Championship season opening victory against Burton Albion, in what was his first competitive match in English football. Former Rennes boss Montanier also confirmed that the injury to goalkeeper Dorus de Vries, suffered in the 4-3 victory over Burton on Saturday, is not as bad as first feared. "It will be a few weeks, but not serious," Montanier said.	Nottingham Forest manager Philippe Montanier says he wants to guide the Championship side into Europe next season as EFL Cup holders.
Ministers promised a response after AMs claimed the 2013 Active Travel Act had failed to achieve its potential due to a lack of funding and leadership. Healthy travel will be promoted in school lessons, public health campaigns, and investment decisions, backed up by monitored targets. Transport Minister Edwina Hart said there was a need for "culture change". Local councils are obliged to provide routes for cyclists and walkers and to consider their needs when planning new road and rail links under the 2013 legislation. But there was "considerable frustration" among supporters of active travel at the lack of progress, the business and enterprise committee reported in February. Chairman William Graham claimed AMs felt the commitment of ministers had "started to waver before it has properly begun". The Active Travel Action Plan published by the Welsh government on Tuesday sets out expectations in areas ranging from leadership and infrastructure to skills and training. An annual progress report will monitor how many more adults and children have been encouraged to take up walking or cycling. "Increasing levels of walking and cycling offers many health and social benefits," said Mrs Hart. "We know that most people in Wales currently make no or very few walking and cycling journeys. "This plan sets out how we can achieve our ambition of making walking and cycling part of everyday life through a culture change, both within organisations, and among individuals, as well as action to reduce barriers to active travel."	Schools, the health service and planning laws will be used to boost walking and cycling in an action plan.
Supporters and colleagues gathered outside the Alvorada Palace to bid her farewell, some handing her flowers. Ms Rousseff was dismissed last week after the Senate found her guilty of manipulating the budget. She denies wrongdoing and has dismissed her impeachment as a "coup d'etat". Brazilian television showed Ms Rousseff walking out of the presidential residence surrounded by former ministers and Congressmen from her Workers' Party. How will history look back on impeachment? Profile: Dilma Rousseff Supporter Cecilia Monteir, 56, said she was "very, very sad, feeling like the country will be left a bit orphaned". More supporters awaited Ms Rousseff as she arrived at an airport to board a plane to the southern city of Porto Alegre, her adopted hometown. On her arrival she was greeted by more well-wishers. Hours after the impeachment vote, Ms Rousseff's vice-president Michel Temer, was sworn in, ending 13 years in power for the left-wing Workers' Party. He will serve out Ms Rousseff's term until 1 January 2019. Ms Rousseff has filed an appeal at the Supreme Court against the Senate's decision but correspondents say it has very little chance of succeeding.	Former Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff has left her official residence in the capital Brasilia for the last time following her impeachment and removal from office.
The 21-year-old, who has also played on the wing, has progressed through Wigan's youth system. Tierney is the son of former England dual-code international Jason Robinson, who also played for the Warriors. "It is a huge achievement for me to agree this contract extension and I'm very happy to be staying at my hometown club," said Tierney. His new deal also includes the option of a further year. "Lewis is a good young Wigan kid who knows what it means to play for this great club," added head coach Shaun Wane. "He has improved a greatly in the last few years and it excites me that there is still a lot more improvement to come."	Wigan Warriors full-back Lewis Tierney has signed a new three-year deal with the Super League side until 2019.
On Friday, the Florida jury ruled Gawker had violated Hogan's right to privacy, awarding him $115m (Â£79m) for economic damage and emotional distress. But jurors decided on the additional measure as a punishment for the company and a deterrent to others. Gawker, who warned the verdict was already "debilitating", will appeal. The video was posted in 2012 after Hogan, whose given name is Terry Bollea, was secretly recorded having sex with his friend's wife. Hogan's legal team successfully argued the New York-based website violated his privacy and the video was not newsworthy. The closely-watched case raised questions about the freedom of the press in the digital age and could lead to greater caution among online sites. Gawker Media was hit with a $15m ruling, while owner Nick Denton was stung with an additional $10 million. The editor who posted the video and wrote the accompanying post, AJ Daulerio, must also pay $100,000. However correspondents say the company stands a good chance of getting the damages reduced or reversed on appeal. The jury was told that Gawker Media is worth $83 million, while Nick Denton has a total of $121 million. Mr Daulerio has no assets, the court heard, only thousands of dollars in student debts.	Ex-professional wrestler Hulk Hogan has won a further $25m (Â£17m) in punitive damages from gossip site Gawker over the publication of a sex tape.
Handing over an envelope containing 50,000 Vietnamese dong (VND) ($2.4, Â£1.6) did not do the trick, but when she added another 50,000 VND, the referral was secured. The 33-year-old woman, who did not want to be identified, then gave an envelope containing 500,000 VND ($24, Â£16) to the medical staff at the provincial hospital, an amount that was more than two months of her income. "All other patients told me that everyone must give envelopes to thank the doctors and nurses for the treatment, and that was the rate for such an operation," she said. The staff did not ask for it but she believed that by giving the envelope her son would receive better care. She is not alone. Mrs Phin, a pensioner from a Hanoi suburb who lives on 3m VND per month, handed over an envelope containing 200,000 VND after eye treatment in hospital. But she was sent home before the treatment was complete. So she was admitted to hospital again and that meant another thank-you envelope. "It cost me another 200,000 VND to thank the doctors and nurses. I could only afford the smallest amount suggested by other patients," she said. Mrs Luyen, a retired teacher from a small town 35km outside of Hanoi, said passing over a cash gift for medical treatment was effectively mandatory. "Not all doctors ask for the envelopes but giving envelopes is a must when you go to hospital. It's in our culture," she said. In Vietnam, medical treatment is mostly subsidised by the state via an insurance system free to civil servants and children, or paid for privately or by employers. But queues for treatment under insurance cover are long and public hospitals overcrowded, while salaries for much of the medical profession remain low. And with growing capitalist sentiment meeting entrenched Confucian values, the practice of handing over a cash-filled envelope to secure faster or better service has become widespread. The number of people who gave envelopes doubled in the three years from 2007-2010 - from 13% to 29%, one study showed. In 2012, a survey published by the World Bank and Vietnam's Government Inspectorate (which runs the Anti-Corruption Bureau) showed that 76% of those who had paid a bribe to health service personnel did so voluntarily, with only 21% responding to a request. In an effort to fight corruption, five big hospitals in Hanoi launched a campaign in October 2011 to bolster ethical behaviour among staff, including a "Say no to envelopes" policy. Vietnam's Research and Training Centre for Community Development (RTCCD) also conducted a similar campaign to change perceptions of informal payments, using the media to raise patients' awareness of their rights as well as of doctors' duties. Nguyen Huu Ngoc, a well-known scholar in Hanoi, said the root of the problem lay in the Confucian gift-giving tradition. "In Vietnamese society as well as in Chinese, gifts stem from gratitude," the scholar said. "Showing gratitude used to have more spiritual value than material value. But over the years, it has become more material and less spiritual, and now in the market economy it is like a transaction." Culture might be used to justify the payments - but culture can be changed, according to Soren Davidsen, a senior governance specialist at the World Bank in Hanoi. "We know gift-giving is an important part of culture. But we also know that culture is not a static but dynamic thing. Several countries in East Asia, such as Singapore, South Korea and Japan, have a culture of corruption, yet these countries have found effective ways to curb corruption. "Although there is often the perception about culture being a part of corruption, we think that this is the wrong way of looking at it. And we can, by involving people, businesses and government in partnership, actually change culture," said Mr Davidsen. For many people, the line between a gift and a bribe has become blurred - something some people embrace as "an excuse to give envelopes", said Tran Thu Ha, vice-director of RTCCD. But for people who campaign to stop the practice like her, it is easy to identify what is a gift and what is a bribe. "A gift can be given in public or anywhere, it needs time to talk and to say thank you, whereas a bribe is often given very quickly and both the giver and the receiver are afraid of being seen by other people," Ms Ha said. But to change people's behaviour is one of the big difficulties that Vietnam is facing and will take time, acknowledged Mr Ngo Manh Hung, deputy director-general of Vietnam's Anti-Corruption Bureau. There has been considerable debate about how to curb the practice in the health service. One suggestion is raising health workers' salaries so that they stop accepting envelopes. But that alone will not be enough. Associate Professor Ta Van Binh, director of the National Institute of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders, believes that the government needs clear rules and tough punishments for medical staff who break them. But work also needs to be done to help patients understand that they do not need to give envelopes - and may themselves be breaking the rules if they do. Nguyen Huu Ngoc even thinks that there should be sanctions applied to patients who give envelopes to help clean up the industry. But this would need co-operation from all sides - patients, health workers and the authorities - and remains a big task. "It's not an easy thing to do because corruption is about money, people and power," said Mr Davidsen of the World Bank. "It's a huge challenge curbing corruption and co-ordinating anti-corruption efforts across government agencies. It is not a quick fix and can't be done overnight." There will be a series of special reports and articles this week as the BBC examines why bribes and backhanders are part of the system in so much of the world, looks at countries which have tried to roll back the tide - and explains how corruption works.	Three months ago, a woman from a village south of Hanoi needed her son referred to a provincial hospital by a district doctor for an operation.
Mr Yanukovych flew from China to Sochi in southern Russia for the meeting. He also cancelled a visit to Malta. Last month he shelved a partnership deal with the EU, triggering angry protests in Ukraine's capital Kiev. Jailed opposition politician Yulia Tymoshenko has reportedly called off a prison hunger strike. The former prime minister's daughter, Eugenia, said her mother had accepted a request from protesters in Kiev to stop the fast. She had reportedly begun the hunger strike on 25 November in protest at Mr Yanukovych's failure to sign the EU deal. Thousands of anti-Yanukovych protesters remain outside the government building on Kiev's Independence Square, braving bitter cold. They are furious that he made an 11th-hour U-turn in relations with the EU, refusing to sign the association agreement that had been prepared during years of negotiations. In Sochi, Mr Yanukovych discussed "preparation of a future treaty on strategic partnership" with Russia, his press service said. The talks covered various economic issues, the statement said, without elaborating. Mr Putin has been urging Ukraine to join Russia's customs union with Belarus and Kazakhstan - a union whose entry terms are far less demanding than the EU's. In recent months Russia has put Ukraine under economic pressure, imposing long customs delays at the border and banning imports of Ukrainian sweets. Arseniy Yatsenyuk, a Tymoshenko ally and leader of the main opposition faction in parliament, condemned the talks in Sochi. "Their attempts to sell Ukraine to Russia have not ended in any way," he said.  "If Yanukovych tries to sign anything with Russia about the customs union it will lead to a bigger wave of protests."	Ukraine's President Viktor Yanukovych and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin have held surprise talks on a "strategic partnership treaty".
The Welsh county won three of 16 games in the County Championship Division Two last season and failed to make progress in the limited overs competitions. Mott is in the third and final year of contract as Glamorgan's head of elite performance. "You do feel in the third year that you should see the fruits of your labour," said Mott. "We have built a squad over the last couple of years and this is the year where we should be looking to improve a helluva lot. "Last year, we made some improvements towards the back end, but it was too little, too late. "This month of April is very important for everyone at the club and in Wales. We have to start to show what we have got." Glamorgan lost James Harris, who is one of four uncapped players in England's ICC Champions Trophy provisional squad, after he agreed to join Middlesex on a three-year contract at the end of last season. Veteran Robert Croft also retired after 23 seasons with the Welsh county. Seam bowler Harris triggered a clause in his contract that allowed him to leave Glamorgan, who gave him his first-class debut as a 16-year-old in 2007, if the Welsh county were not in the top tier. Mott has returned from a 10-day pre-season tour of South Africa with Glamorgan and is convinced his squad are ready to learn the lessons of  last seasons's disappointing campaign. "We need to improve across the board," said Mott. "A realistic goal is to win more games than we lose and we didn't get close to that last year. "If we get close to that, just like any side in this division, it can come down to the last couple of games and you are challenging, but we have to start the season better. "We finished well last season but our start really killed us and our promotion aspirations." Glamorgan have added Australian bowler Michael Hogan and Zimbabwean batsman Murray Goodwin to their squad this year. Australian Marcus North is to lead the one-day side, while his countryman, pace bowler Dirk Nannes, has been signed to play in the Friends Life T20. On Friday, Glamorgan play their final pre-season friendly with a three-day match against Cardiff MCCU. Their first game of the season is against Northamptonshire in the County Championship in Cardiff on Wednesday.	Glamorgan chief Matthew Mott says he expects his side to secure vastly improved results this season.
Tennant was the 10th Doctor and Piper played his on-screen companion Rose Tyler in the BBC One show. Filming on the show, which will also star John Hurt, will start next week. Tennant's successor, Matt Smith - also in the special with his new assistant played by Jenna-Louise Coleman - says fans "will not be disappointed" by the 3D show, due to air on 23 November. Tennant and Piper have long been rumoured to be making a return for the special, which is being written by the show's executive producer and lead writer Steven Moffat. In January, Piper, appearing on the Graham Norton show, denied she would be appearing. "I wasn't asked, no," she said. "I think Matt Smith may have said, in passing or in jest, it would be nice. "I think maybe he said that and then it became something quite different, but no." Smith has said the show "manages to pay homage to everything - and look forward". "I read it and I clapped at the end. I think it's hilarious, it's epic and it's vast," he said. Moffat, meanwhile, has said he took special care to protect the secrets of the story. "One length I've gone to which is a really good security measure - I make sure I don't get a script, because I will lose it," he said. "I forbid people to hand me one. It's on my computer under lock and key." The first story of Doctor Who's 2013 run, The Bells of Saint John - described by Moffat as a "proper London thriller" - was screened on Saturday. Viewers saw the Doctor and new companion, Clara, played by Coleman, battling an evil entity in the world's wi-fi networks. Future episodes of the show, which is filmed in Cardiff, see the return of the Cybermen and old enemy the Ice Warriors, who last appeared during the Jon Pertwee era in 1974. Tennant starred in Doctor Who from 2005 to 2010 while Piper first appeared in 2005 opposite Christopher Eccleston, who played the ninth Doctor. She left the show in 2006 but returned for a number of episodes in 2008 as well as for Tennant's final episode, broadcast on 1 January 2010. The first episode of Doctor Who, An Unearthly Child, starring William Hartnell as the Timelord, was broadcast on 23 November 1963. As part of the anniversary events, the BBC will also broadcast An Adventure in Space and Time - a one-off drama looking at how the sci-fi show came to be made. Doctor Who: The Bells of Saint John will be shown on BBC One at 18:15 GMT on Saturday.	David Tennant and Billie Piper will appear in the 50th anniversary special of Doctor Who, the BBC has confirmed.
The service for friends and relatives of Steve Warren was held at Huntworth near Bridgwater. Mr Warren's sister Kay Coombes said: "He would want us to celebrate his life." His family also met the US Coastguard in Boston earlier in the week to thank them for their efforts in the search. Ms Coombes and Mr Warren's family returned earlier this week from their trip which included visiting Cape Cod, the nearest landmass to where the yacht was reported missing. The yacht's upturned hull was found by the US Coast Guard on 23 May. There was no sign of Mr Warren or his fellow yachtsmen; Andrew Bridge, 22, from Farnham, Surrey; Paul Goslin, 56, from West Camel, Somerset and 22-year-old James Male, from Romsey, Hampshire. Speaking of the visit Ms Coombes said: "The coastguard put an awful lot of effort into this and we have since found out... that this was one of the most complex cases they have dealt with. "We didn't realise that at the time and it was lovely to be able to go over there and say thank you face-to-face." She said the memorial had been organised in accordance with her brother's wishes and would be a "very personal service". Another memorial is set to be held on Friday for Mr Goslin, in Sherborne.	A memorial service has been held for one of the four yachtsmen who was lost at sea when their yacht Cheeki Rafiki capsized in the Atlantic.
The key moment was a fumble by Mayo keeper Robert Hennelly early in the second half which gifted Dublin a penalty scored by Diarmuid Connolly. Hennelly was a late inclusion in place of David Clarke but the move backfired. Deep in injury-time, Cillian O'Connor missed a difficult free which would have levelled the scores. Lee Keegan's goal put Mayo ahead midway through the first period but Dublin regrouped to lead 0-10 to 1-6 by half-time. Hennelly struggled badly with his kick-outs early on with one of his misdirected clearances leading to the black carding of the influential Keegan late in the first half in what was a huge blow for the Connacht county. Earlier, Dublin's Jonny Cooper was also black carded and a number other players from both sides - notably Dublin's John Small - were fortunate not to suffer the same fate. In the end, Dublin's stronger bench proved decisive as Cormac Costello came on to kick the champions' three final scores from play. Cillian O'Connor's ninth point of the contest left the minimum between the teams with three minutes of injury-time left but the Mayo free-taker then missed a high-pressure free from 40 metres which would have levelled the scores again. As Dublin celebrated back-to-back titles for the first time since the county's triumphs in 1976 and '77, Mayo's players looked crestfallen as they attempted to come to terms with a fifth All-Ireland final defeat in 12 years. With Hennelly struggling to pick out team-mates from his kick-outs, Dublin moved into a 0-4 to 0-0 lead by the sixth minute which included three Dean Rock points - two of which were from play. But Mayo were on terms within six minutes after a run of four points started by Patrick Durcan's superb point. Two Rock frees edged Dublin ahead again but Mayo were suddenly in the lead as the over-lapping Keegan took a perfectly weighted pass from Aidan O'Shea before hammering past Stephen Cluxton from 14 yards. Cooper's black carding moments later for a hand trip appeared a further boost for Mayo but the Dubs outscored them 0-4 to 0-2 during the remainder of the first period to lead 0-10 to 1-6 at the break. Mayo regained the lead within two minutes of the restart but were soon three in arrears after another Rock free was followed by Hennelly's howler as he was forced to concede a penalty after spilling a harmless looking ball, with his inevitable black carding followed by Connolly superbly stroking past Clarke. Mayo cut Dublin's lead to the minimum on four occasions during the remaining half hour of action but their habitual woes of errant shooting and a lack of composure prevented them from getting on terms. Once again, Aidan O'Shea was not the force that Mayo would have hoped for despite his good work for their first-half goal. Mayo: R Hennelly, B Harrison, D Vaughan,  K Higgins, L Keegan, C Boyle, P Durcan, S O'Shea, T Parsons, K McLoughlin, A O'Shea, D O'Connor, J Doherty. A Moran, C O'Connor. Dublin: S Cluxton; P McMahon, J Cooper, M Fitzsimons; J McCarthy, C O'Sullivan, J Small; B Fenton, P Mannion; P Flynn, K McManamon, C Kilkenny; D Rock, D Connolly, B Brogan.	Mayo's 65-year wait for an All-Ireland Senior Football title goes on after holders Dublin edged a 1-15 to 1-14 win in the final replay at Croke Park.
The crossing in Rochdale, Greater Manchester, was concreted over in 1904 when the tram network expanded. It re-opened to pedestrians after a Â£5m project, which also exposed a section of the River Roch in the town. Work on uncovering the bridge started 18 months ago and is part of a Â£250m transformation of the town due to end in 2019. A Rochdale Council spokeswoman said the crossing is believed to have been built in about 1324 when Edward II ruled England. It expanded as the town grew, with sections added in the Restoration and Georgian eras. Merchants travelled over the bridge to Yorkshire to buy wool which was then finished in Rochdale's mills. In the 1700s it was one of two main routes from Lancashire to Yorkshire, making Rochdale one of the most important towns in the region ahead of the Industrial Revolution. The council said the re-exposed section of the river would help prevent flooding.	A bridge built in the 14th Century has reopened after it was hidden from view for more than a century.
Meden Sports Centre in Warsop, Nottinghamshire, has faced ongoing maintenance issues with a temporary closures and Â£500,000 spent on repairs. Mansfield District Council has said it is "unsustainable" and has launched a consultation on its future. However, Warsop Parish Council said it was "essential" to the area and it would fight to keep it open. The centre, which dates from the 1960s, was closed for six months in 2014 after an inspection identified fire safety concerns. Officials have said renovation or rebuilding costs could cost between Â£1m to Â£8m. Andrew Tristram, district council portfolio holder for the environment, said: "The council has undergone a review of leisure services at Meden Sports Centre and concluded that the current operating model is not sustainable for the future. "There are increasing uncertainties about the running costs and capital investment due to the condition of the building". However, parish council chairman Andy Wetton said: "The centre is essential to the area but this administration seems hell-bent on closing it. "There was money available to replace it but this has been spent on other things. "Any attempt to close it would be a declaration of war on Warsop and we would fight it hard." The district council said no changes would be made before April 2018.	Any move to close a sports centre would be a "declaration of war" on the local community, a councillor has warned.
Financial stocks led the way, as the momentum in Washington for an overhaul of bank regulations held up in advance of a preliminary vote on Thursday. The Dow Jones climbed 37.46 points or 0.18% to 21,173.69. The wider S&P 500 added 2.81 points, rising 0.16% to 2,433.09. The Nasdaq closed up 0.34% at 6,296.70. Trade volume lessened, as investors trod with caution ahead of the UK general election and former FBI director James Comey's testimony in Washington on Thursday. Some of the impact of that testimony was blunted by the release of his prepared remarks, which repeated already available information. Energy stocks fared the worst on Wednesday, as oil prices slid following a new report that showed a rise in US production. Financial firms were among the biggest risers. The US House of Representatives is expected to approve a bill on Thursday that would undo many of the financial rules put in place after the 2008 crisis. Few expect the proposal in its current form to advance from the House into law, but they say its support is a sign that a more limited reform could succeed. The Federal Reserve also said three major banks, including Deutsche Bank and UBS Group, would be given more time to comply with one of those financial rules. Bank of America shares closed the day up 1.66%, JP Morgan Chase gained 1.15%, Deutsche added 0.75% and Goldman Sachs rose 0.58%.	Shares on Wall Street closed higher on Wednesday, recovering ground after a fall on Tuesday.
The name is expressed with affection by some, with hostility by others, but it calls up history for everyone. The story of his life is very much the story of our times: revolutionary movements, the Cold War, East v West, North v South, communism v capitalism - except that most of the world has passed him by. Fidel Castro has remained the same, a symbol of revolution, a communist who has survived the fall of communism. Before surgery took him out of public view in July 2006, he inspired his followers with slogans and five-hour speeches. Fidel's views continued to be made public though in the form of editorials and occasional TV appearances. Fidel maintained his rule with an iron grip, sending opponents to prison for years. Throughout his leadership, he railed against the US, its economic and trade embargo and against the evils of free markets Fidel has been praised for standing up for the oppressed of Latin America, for opposing the Yankee imperialist, for making Cuba into a more equal society than many, for developing Cuba's health service and sending doctors abroad to help others. And it wasn't only doctors he sent abroad. He despatched troops to Angola and Ethiopia in support of fellow revolutionaries. His hand was seen in many a revolutionary movement in his own continent. But he has also been condemned for intolerance, for keeping his people poor and for refusing to see the benefits of economic liberalisation that even the communists of China have embraced. Fidel Castro stopped his people from leaving the island, leading them to risk their lives in rickety boats to try to get out. At one stage in the early years of the Reagan administration he was accused of trying to take over Central America for the Soviet Union by revolution. Washington at that time saw a path that led from the guerrillas of El Salvador through Nicaragua to Cuba and right up to the door of the Kremlin. Cuban assistance to the small and then revolutionary island of Grenada in the Caribbean prompted a full-scale US invasion. Throughout his rule, President Castro remained in almost permanent confrontation with the United States - and it with him. The American embargo on Cuba has been used by both sides - as a policy by the US to isolate Cuba and as an excuse by Fidel Castro for the island's poverty. US President Barack Obama and Castro's successor as president, younger brother Raul, announced a thawing in relations in 2015 but the embargo remains in place. When Mr Obama visited earlier this year - the first by a US leader in more than half a century - Castro remained defiant, saying Cuba did not need any gifts from the "empire" in a damning letter. He cut a giant figure on the world stage during the 47 years he controlled Cuba - at one point bringing the US and the Soviet Union to the brink of nuclear war. It was the Cuban missile crisis of 1962 that propelled him into worldwide prominence. Before that he had been just a glamorous revolutionary leader. He had overthrown the dictator Batista in a classic guerrilla war and had fought off an American-led invasion by Cuban exiles on the Bay of Pigs in 1961. But when Nikita Khrushchev decided, with Fidel Castro's agreement, to station nuclear missiles in Cuba itself, the island leader turned from being a thorn in the side of the Americans into being a mortal threat. It was only the skilled diplomacy of Jack Kennedy (and of Khrushchev in the end) that saved the day, and Fidel's own island from destruction. The then-US defence Secretary Robert McNamara met President Castro in 1992. He said the Cuban leader told him there were 162 nuclear missiles in Cuba at the time of the crisis. He asked Castro if he had recommended they be used. The answer was: "Yes, I did." "And what would have happened to Cuba?" Mr McNamara asked him. "It would have been destroyed." Fidel Castro was not part of the diplomacy that ended the missile crisis. But he came out of the crisis remarkably strengthened. Kennedy promised that the US would not invade Cuba, a promise that has held. The CIA made efforts to get rid of him with bizarre plots involving the Mafia and poison. They came to nothing. President Castro's people took immense precautions to protect him from potential harm from food and drink, as diplomats who invite him to their receptions in Havana found out. He survived harm from his enemies. And whatever happens to Cuba after him, the name of Fidel will survive in history.	He is instantly recognisable both from his appearance - the beard and the military fatigues - and from his first name alone: Fidel.
Frank Field, who is backing the Leave campaign, will say the 23 June poll poses "an untold danger" for his party's prospects of power. The vast majority of Labour MPs back EU membership. Meanwhile former Labour home secretary Alan Johnson will tell union members that EU membership is "vital" for workers' rights. The UK's EU vote: All you need to know Mr Field, the MP for Birkenhead and a former welfare minister, is expected to warn in a speech that the referendum could be "the second-longest suicide note in Labour's history" - behind the manifesto that preceded its 1983 general election drubbing. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who has expressed Eurosceptic views in the past, recently made his first major speech of the referendum campaign setting out a "socialist" vision for Britain in Europe. He said there was "nothing half-hearted" about Labour's campaign and said he would continue to make the case for membership in the run-up to polling day. But Mr Field will say: "The last thing Jeremy needs to do is to undermine further the traditional Labour vote, much of which wishes to leave the European Union. "For the party leader more actively to campaign for the Remain campaign will push even more Labour voters into the arms of UKIP." Mr Field, who campaigns for "balanced migration", will criticise an "open-door policy" which he says pushes down wages and puts a strain on public services. Ahead of the speech, Mr Field said Labour MPs' overwhelming support for staying in the EU was "very unrepresentative" of the views of many of the party's activists in the country at large. "While the polls show a majority of Labour voters support staying in Europe, about 40% do not and the number of MPs who represent that view are a mere handful," he told BBC Radio 4's Today. "It is our job to make a good case for leaving Europe so these voters feel that at last their views are being represented in the debate." The Leave campaign has targeted migration this week with interventions from Michael Gove and Boris Johnson as it attempted to regain the initiative following warnings about the economic effect of a vote to leave. Alan Johnson, who is leading his party's Remain campaign, will claim a vote to stay in the EU would be as important as the election of Labour's reforming government in 1945, which led to the creation of the NHS and expanded welfare. "From nurses and builders to railway workers, steel workers, postal workers and shop workers, trade unions will be campaigning for a Britain that remains in Europe," he will tell the Usdaw union's conference. "The rights of working people are protected by our EU membership, and Labour and our union movement are united in campaigning for Britain to remain in Europe." Elsewhere in the EU debate, the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee published what it said was a "reliable, unbiased analysis" of the issues involved. The cross-party committee, which was divided on whether to back EU membership, said it had chosen not to endorse either side. Instead it urged voters to consider the UK's trading relationship with the rest of the EU and the rest of the world, its "international representation and reputation" and how the EU and its policies might develop in the future. Committee chairman Crispin Blunt said: "The referendum offers the British people a once-in-a-generation opportunity to chart a course for the UK's role in the world. "Voters should consider not only the short-term consequences of staying or leaving but the long-term opportunities and challenges."	Labour risks losing "a swathe" of voters to UKIP by campaigning to remain in the EU, one of its MPs is to warn.
Devon and Cornwall Police confirmed the body was recovered from rocks to the north of Tresco. Officers said the family of missing man Josh Clayton, 23, had been informed but no formal identification had been made. A search was launched for Mr Clayton from Taunton, who works for the Tresco Estate, after he went missing on 13 September. Sgt Colin Taylor of Devon and Cornwall Police said the body was discovered by a French yachtsman just before 1800 BST on Wednesday and was recovered by the St Mary's lifeboat. Sgt Taylor said: "The lifeboat crews got to Tean which is just between Tresco and St Martins... From between the high water mark and the low water mark they recovered the body of what's believed to be a male," he said. He said the body would be repatriated to the mainland on the Scillonian ferry on Thursday and formal identification was likely to be carried out next week. He said the effort of the local community, police and rescue groups in the eight-day search for Josh Clayton had been "fantastic". "I am amazed by humanity, I am very very impressed by what happened on Tresco Estate and how they mobilised themselves." Mike Nellams, of Tresco Estate, said letters had been sent to staff and some holiday-makers to inform them. "Of course we're all very sad but actually it's a bit of a relief as well, really," he said. "We're actually a very tight community in the nicest sense... So everybody wanted to help and assist and that's normal for Tresco. Sadly the outcome wasn't for the best but it wasn't for the lack of trying."	A body has been found in the water off the Isles of Scilly.
This is despite the company reporting a pre-tax profit of Â£36m in the first half of 2015, compared with a loss of Â£9m a year earlier. The group said the turnaround was due to "robust trading" in its food and funeral businesses. These are the first results since radical changes to the business were brought in at the end of last year. Following a review of the business by Lord Myners, the number of board members was cut drastically, while directors had to have qualifications suited to running the business. Members were also given one vote each. The business recorded a deficit of Â£2.5bn in 2013 following massive losses at the Co-operative Bank. Following changes in the ownership structure of the bank, the Co-op Group now holds just a 20% stake in the bank. "We've made a good start on the three year journey to rebuild the Co-operative Group," said chief executive Richard Pennycook of the half-year results. "These early days are about fixing the basics - putting in place new leadership teams and providing the investment to deliver the strategies for our businesses. Our customers and members are beginning to see the difference. The food business saw like-for-like sales at its main convenience stores increase by 3.3%, as well as 35 new store openings. The funeral business saw volumes rise by almost 12%, "principally due to a high death rate". Despite the improvement in the business seen in the first half of the year, the company warned that "we expect full-year profitability to reduce year on year, given the planned and increased levels of investment we are making in the second half of the year". It also said that, again due to greater investment, it was unlikely to declare any dividends before 2018.	The Co-operative Group has said increased investment means profits this year will be lower than in 2014.
The 33-1 shot, ridden by David Mullins and trained by Mouse Morris, triumphed at Aintree in April to become the first novice to win the race since 1958. The nine-year-old, owned by the Gigginstown House Stud, has twice recovered from a cracked pelvis. "We didn't want to send him back to Aintree with a big weight, that wouldn't be fair," said Gigginstown's racing manager Eddie O'Leary. "He provided us with our first Grand National and we'll never forget him." BBC horse racing correspondent Cornelius Lysaght: "As the first Grand National winner for owner Michael O'Leary's burgeoning Gigginstown House Stud as well as the first novice chaser to win the race in nearly 60 years, Rule The World has his place in history. "Though he ran highly respectably at Punchestown after Aintree, O'Leary had already hinted that, having defied serious injury to reach one of the great pinnacles, he had perhaps done his bit. "What a season for Gigginstown, with success at Aintree, in the Irish National and Cheltenham Gold Cup, but at a price. Rule the World has been retired and there are doubts whether Gold Cup winner Don Cossack will race again."	This year's Grand National winner Rule The World has been retired.
They are the stars of a new South Korean apocalyptic thriller terrorising audiences and breaking box office records at home and set to open in cinemas across Asia this week. Director Yeon Sang-ho's adrenaline-filled Train to Busan premiered at this year's Cannes Film Festival. Blood, brains and mayhem all feature prominently as hordes of zombies devour unfortunate passengers trapped on board a bullet train from Seoul. Train to Busan is South Korea's first home-grown zombie offering and has already achieved local box office success, taking a record $5.76m (Â£4.33m) on its opening day in July. The movie starts off with an innocent enough train journey, until a viral outbreak outside starts to infect passengers on board, turning them into the undead. The Korean government eventually declares a state of emergency and martial law. At the heart of the chaos is actor Gong Yoo, a typically-workaholic South Korean businessman travelling with his estranged daughter, oblivious to the unfolding apocalypse. The monsters are fast, really fast, and their attacks lightning speed, putting their Hollywood counterparts from World War Z to shame. Equally terrifying is the infection and the rate at which it spreads rapidly between those unlucky enough to be trapped onboard as the high-speed train races to its final destination. To young Koreans like student Hahn Kwan-woo, 23, it is the film they have been waiting for. "Western films featuring zombies have always been huge hits in our country and there was not a single Korean zombie movie until 'Train to Busan' came out," he said. "Many of my favourite actors also star in the movie." It may have all the predictable elements of a zombie story, but aficionados have also praised the film's uniquely South Korean take on the genre. "With a Mers epidemic [Middle East respiratory syndrome] sweeping South Korea in 2015 and soaring discontent with corruption and economic disparity, a zombie apocalypse serves as a potent allegory for the dog-eat-dog world," film critic Maggie Lee explained in one review. Stunning visual and special effects and "lean, gritty" screenplay also could not have hurt its chances of domestic success. Other critics praised the "brilliant" choice of setting on a Korean bullet train. "I even have a friend who loved it because she takes the same train every time she goes home," said Mr Hahn. But timing was also key, due to the appetite for summertime horror movies, said Jean Lee, a journalist and Wilson Center Global Fellow who also teaches Korean culture and film courses. "South Korean horror films really took off in the late 1990s and 'Train to Busan' is a new twist on the horror genre," she told BBC News from Seoul. "Most horror movies here are released in the summer, when the heat and humidity send people into air-conditioned theatres for movies that quite literally send a chill up their spines." Of course the best part about zombie movies is getting to see the best and worst of humanity, as the world comes to an end. "'Train to Busan': Best zombie scare ever. This is coming from someone who can't even watch 'The Walking Dead'," wrote one fan on Twitter, referencing the popular US drama series. Some even proclaimed it the "best zombie movie" they have ever seen. Fans like 24-year-old Oh Won-heo hope the movie will propel home-grown horror films to an international audience. "When people mention Asian horror, they think of Japan. But Korean horror tales are truly frightening and I hope 'Train to Busan' will make the world realise that our local movies are just as scary - or even better." However, he added: "For my sake, I hope Hollywood will not ruin it with a remake." On that point he may be out of luck - European and US film studios are already reported to be vying to make their own version.	Snakes on planes are old hat - it's zombies on trains you need to worry about this year.
The service was held at the 22-year-old's school in Ohio, before his burial at a nearby cemetery. His death has heightened tensions between the US and North Korea. Pyongyang has called President Donald Trump a "psychopath", while he describes N Korea as a brutal regime. Pyongyang's official Rodong Sinmun newspaper claimed Mr Trump might launch a pre-emptive strike on North Korea to divert attention from his domestic difficulties, and warned South Korea "that following psychopath Trump... will only lead to disaster". Earlier in the week, after announcing Mr Warmbier's death, President Trump said he was determined to "prevent such tragedies from befalling innocent people at the hands of regimes that do not respect the rule of law or basic human decency". The thousands of funeral goers formed two lines as Mr Warmbier's coffin was carried into Wyoming High School for the 45-minute service, and then along the three-mile route to the cemetery. There was only space for 800 people inside the school's auditorium so most attendees watched the service on monitors in overflow rooms, CNN reports. Mr Warmbier's brother and sister, along with some friends, spoke during the service. Bagpipes played as mourners, wearing blue and white ribbons - the school's colours - to honour the former student, left the school. Thousands of people from his small hometown of Wyoming, Ohio, packed into Otto Warmbier's old high school for his funeral. For most, his casket was the first they had seen of Otto since he went to North Korea - awful confirmation of the shocking, surreal set of circumstances that had played out since early last year. Among several politicians in attendance, including officials from the state and defence departments was the Ohio Senator Rob Portman, who had been involved in the quest to bring him home. Mr Portman reflected a sense that while today was a time to talk about Mr Warmbier's life, as a young man with huge potential, the issue of responsibility had to be addressed. After the funeral, mourners stood to watch the cortege pass and disappear through the streets with blue and white ribbons tied to all the trees in his honour. As they reflect, there are many not just here but across the country, asking how North Korea will now pay for what many see as the murder of an American citizen. Otto Warmbier was returned by North Korea to the US last week, more than a year after he had been sentenced to 15 years' hard labour. He was in a coma and died a few days later. His parents say that though he never spoke or opened his eyes, "the countenance of his face changed - he was at peace. He was home and we believe he could sense that". US doctors say he suffered a "severe neurological injury", the most likely cause of which was a cardiopulmonary arrest that had cut the blood supply to the brain. A post-mortem examination was not carried out at the request of the family. Otto Warmbier, a student at the University of Virginia, was travelling with a tour group when he was arrested at Pyongyang airport in January 2016. He was accused of stealing a propaganda sign from a hotel and, two months later, was sentenced during a short trial. His family had no news of him until 13 June, when Pyongyang said he had been in a coma since his trial after contracting botulism and receiving a sleeping pill. US doctors say there is no evidence he suffered from botulism, and the Warmbier family believe he died as a result of "awful torturous mistreatment".	More than 2,500 family, friends and well-wishers gathered for the funeral of Otto Warmbier, the US student who died after falling into a coma while in prison in North Korea.
Penglais Farm will have a total of 1,000 rooms, but only 700 will be ready this month to welcome students. The university said developer Balfour Beatty confirmed the remaining 300 rooms will be ready during the 2015-16 academic year. Balfour Beatty has been asked to comment. The unfinished rooms have not been let to students.	Hundreds of rooms at a £45m student halls development at Aberystwyth University will not be ready for the new term.
He claims Universal Music have only paid the band a "miniscule fraction" of the money they were owed from downloads on sites like iTunes and Amazon. The musician is suing for compensation, according to legal documents filed in Los Angeles on Wednesday. The claim is also filed on behalf of his sister, Karen, who died in 1983. Carpenter hired accountants to examine financial statements from Universal Music and its subsidiary, A&M Records, which has released The Carpenters' music since their debut album in 1969. He says they found multiple errors, and that the labels "improperly classified" revenue from digital downloads of The Carpenters' music as sales of physical records  - which attract a lower royalty rate. He also claims that digital downloads were undercounted. In a statement, Carpenter said he had been unable to resolve the dispute without suing. "The Carpenters recordings are among the best sellers in the history of popular music, and after 48 years continue to contribute a substantial amount to [Universal's] annual bottom line," he wrote. "It seems only fair that these companies account fairly to my sister's estate and to me." Specialising in radio-friendly soft rock, The Carpenters sold millions of records in the 1970s. The brother-sister duo won three Grammy Awards in 1970 and 1971, including best new artist and best vocal performance for the ballad (They Long to Be) Close to You. The band's career was cut short when Karen developed anorexia nervosa in 1975. Although they continued to record, the condition eventually led to her death, from heart failure. Richard Carpenter's legal claim is one of many filed in the US after a 2010 court case involving Eminem, which resulted in a ruling that artists should receive higher royalty payments for digital downloads than they do when a CD or vinyl album is sold. The difference is substantial. According to Billboard, artists get 15% of the money generated by the sale of a record. For downloads, which are counted as "licensed content",  the figure 50%. Artists including Peter Frampton, Public Enemy, Whitesnake and The Temptations have all sued, or threatened to sue, in order to obtain the higher rate. Universal Music were not immediately available to respond to the latest case. Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

Richard Carpenter has said he is owed at least $2m (Â£1.6m) in royalties for the hits he recorded in The Carpenters, including Yesterday Once More.
Dartmoor Hill Pony Association (DHPA) said it had put forward the idea "reluctantly". The group claims numbers have dropped from about 30,000 at the beginning of the century to just 1,500 in 2011. The DHPA said if numbers continued to fall, the breed could lose its hardiness to survive on the moor. It said demand had dropped for the ponies as pets because of the economic downturn. The ponies were traditionally used for farming, postal deliveries and pulling carts. Charlotte Faulkner, founder of the DHPA, said in a letter to South West Equine Protection (Swep): "It has taken years of considering reports and listening to the outcome of meetings to recognise and reluctantly accept that Dartmoor pony herders will only carry on keeping their herds if they have a sustainable market for them. "We are in real danger of ponies disappearing from Dartmoor altogether." Ms Faulkner said selling ponies for riding and driving would continue. "The Dartmoor Hill Pony Association believes the meat trade should be (used) too," she said. "Strangely, having a meat trade should improve a pony's chances of finding a new home at sale." Becky Treeby, of Swep, said: "Dartmoor hill ponies were there for a reason, for ecology purposes to keep grass on the moors down, and they have been there for thousands of years. People have never eaten them before. It is promoting over-breeding for profit." You can see more on this story on Inside Out SW on BBC One, Monday 29 September, at 19:30 BST. Correction 2 December 2014: This story has been amended to clarify that it refers to Dartmoor Hill ponies rather than Dartmoor ponies.	Dartmoor Hill ponies should be bred for human consumption to ensure their survival on the moor, says a pony group.
Solly Msimanga, from the opposition Democratic Alliance (DA), said the vehicles would instead be given to a police anti-hijack unit. However, he will continue to use the luxury car used by the previous mayor. The DA took control of Tshwane, a metropolitan area including the capital Pretoria, from the African National Congress (ANC) in local elections. Mr Msimanga said no more luxury cars would be bought under his leadership. He took over from the governing ANC, which lost control of  the capital for the first time since 1994, last month. More on this and other African stories Four things from South Africa election The ANC bought 10 new BMW 3 series vehicles, which are yet to be delivered, for 5 million rand ($356,000; £266,000), local reports say. The cars were meant for members of the mayoral council, with the ANC said to be confident it would retain control of the municipality in the elections. He will still use a BMW 5 series car he inherited from the previous mayor, reports the IOL website. Mr Msimanga's spokesman Matthew Gerstner told the BBC that this vehicle could not "be dispensed with because it's been bought and paid for already and treasury regulations prohibit that". He added: "But, as soon as he can replace it, he will, with a sensible, low-cost vehicle". Mr Msimango says the DA-led coalition government wanted to embark on cost-cutting measures. He said in a statement: "No new luxury cars will be bought or leased for politicians‚ and if vehicles currently owned by Tshwane require replacement‚ sensible and low-cost vehicles will be procured. "I will not allow public money to be spent on luxury cars‚ while our people struggle for services‚ houses and jobs. "A Hyundai i20 or Toyota Corolla can do the same job for a politician as an expensive sedan." The ANC national government has been criticised for wasteful expenditure, so South Africans will be closely watching what the opposition do differently in the key urban areas they won in the August elections, says the BBC's Pumza Fihlani in Johannesburg. South Africans will be keen to see if the opposition, which has until now only run one province, will be able to make good on its ambitious election promises, our correspondent says.	A new mayor in South Africa says he will give away a fleet of new luxury cars ordered by his predecessors.
A spokesman said the new estimate was based on a review of intelligence reports from May to August. IS has seized vast swathes of Iraq and beheaded several hostages in recent months, leading to US airstrikes. US Secretary of State John Kerry is visiting Turkey, seeking more support for action against IS. US officials say retired Gen John Allen will be tasked with forming an international coalition to fight IS. On Thursday, 10 Arab countries agreed to help the US attack the group in both Iraq and Syria. The CIA had previously believed that IS had about 10,000 fighters, spokesman Ryan Trapani said. "This new total reflects an increase in members because of stronger recruitment since June following battlefield successes and the declaration of a caliphate, greater battlefield activity, and additional intelligence," he added. The revision comes a day after President Obama outlined a plan to "degrade and destroy" IS and to increase military support for allied forces engaged in fighting the group. For the first time, he authorised air strikes against the group in Syria. In recent months IS has expanded from its stronghold in eastern Syria and seized control of more towns, cities, army bases and weaponry in Iraq. The US has already carried out more than 150 air strikes against IS in Iraq. It has also sent hundreds of military advisers to assist Iraqi government and Kurdish forces, but has ruled out sending ground troops. Other countries, including the UK, have contributed humanitarian assistance to Iraqis displaced by the group's advance. Mr John Kerry secured the co-operation of several Arab countries during a meeting in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia on Thursday. Nato member Turkey, however, refused to sign a communique calling for countries to join the US in the fight against IS. Analysts say this may be because the group currently holds 49 Turkish citizens, including diplomats. Mr Kerry downplayed the move, saying the important US ally was dealing with some "sensitive issues". He is due to travel to Turkey on Friday to try to secure more co-operation from the government.	The CIA says the Islamic State (IS) militant group may have up to 31,000 fighters in Iraq and Syria - three times as many as previously feared.
In a match reduced to 17 overs per side at Old Trafford, only seven were possible with Lancashire on 39-0. But Warwickshire's win at Yorkshire and Worcestershire's victory over Notts saw the 2014 champions finish fifth in the North Group with a worse net run-rate. Lancashire remain bottom of the group with just two wins. Following a delay of more than four hours, play eventually got under way at 18:15 BST with each innings reduced to 24 overs, and Lancashire's Karl Brown raced to 30 not out. The players went off for rain 30 minutes later, but it was hoped they could start again at 19:45 BST, with the match now 17 overs for each team. However, the weather closed in again and they did not return - meaning both sides take one point.	Durham were eliminated from the One-Day Cup after their match against Lancashire was abandoned and other results went against them.
Mr Musk tweeted that the explosion of Falcon 9 during a routine filling operation was the most complicated in the space travel firm's history. He said that the engines weren't on and there was "no apparent heat source". The rocket's payload, a satellite on which Facebook had leased capacity, was destroyed in the explosion last week. "Still working on the Falcon fireball investigation. Turning out to be the most difficult and complex failure we have ever had in 14 years," Mr Musk tweeted. Facebook, with Eutelsat Communications, had been due to use the Amos-6 satellite for broadband internet coverage for parts of sub-Saharan Africa as part of Facebook's Internet.org initiative. The force of the blast at Cape Canaveral shook buildings several miles away. Mr Musk tweeted that support for the SpaceX investigation by Nasa, the US Federal Aviation Administration, and the US Air Force was "much appreciated". The technology entrepreneur owns and leads SpaceX. Mr Musk is also chief executive of electric car company Tesla Motors and chairman of solar energy firm SolarCity.	An investigation into how a SpaceX rocket exploded is uncovering a "difficult and complex failure", the firm's founder Elon Musk has said.
And it's tucked away for a very good reason. Inside, your senses are greeted by the smell of rotting dog food, the buzz of blowflies and the purple UV light of the fly killer ready to zap escapees. This is where the museum's forensic entomologists breed different species of fly in a bid to help the police solve crimes. Museum scientist Amoret Whitaker is one of just three forensic entomologists in the UK who regularly works with the police to determine the time of death of a corpse. "As soon as a person dies, their body starts to decompose and they give off specific odours. These different chemical signals are very very attractive to insects. And in the inital stages it's especially blowflies." "So when someone dies, fairly soon, it could be within minutes blowflies are attracted to the body and they will start laying eggs immediately. These will hatch into larvae or maggots and the developmental cycle will continue." "You get a lot of male blowflies hanging around, sitting on plants around the body, waiting for suitable female mates." And it is this cycle of life and death that is critical in helping the police when they are uncertain of the timing of someone's death. By understanding the "succession" rates or the speed of growth of flies, from an egg to the larval then adult stage she and her colleagues can determine the likely time that person died. But scientists only have developmental data on perhaps half of the twelve or so species of fly that are regulary found on dead bodies. By breeding them in "captivity" under different temperature conditions they can get more accurate information about the timing of their growth and so the process of death. The accuracy of that timing depends partly on how long the body has been decomposing. If she can get to see a corpse within days of its death,  when that person died can be worked out to an accuracy within hours. But, if the body has lain undiscovered for weeks, or even months, then the precision of timing can be narrowed to a matter of days. This timing can even be used to help determine whether a suspicious death should be treated as murder. "In some cases of assault, if someone has been seen leaving a pub after a fight say, then that person is found dead a few days later, if we can determine when they died to a matter of hours, we can help establish whether the person died from the assault or other causes." The time of year can dramatically affect how a body decomposes. In one case Amoret and colleagues were involved in, a man disappeared in November but his body was not discovered until the following February. One pathologist report suggested the body had been dead for just a few weeks. In fact because he had died in winter his body had effectively been "mummified". The critical evidence came from Calliphora vicina, a bluebottle blowfly often found on dead bodies. C vicina grows all year round but in winter its development slows right down. While it remains alive, it becomes inactive at temperatures below 1C. This peculiarly slow rate of development meant Amoret and colleagues could prove the man had died months ago rather than weeks. The man had left a pub, taken a short-cut home then slipped and broken his neck. The police regularly use Amoret and her colleagues' expertise. "We can go two months with nothing but then be asked to help with six cases in a couple of weeks." "It's rare that our evidence is used in court. It's more common that we give police a time window and they can then gather further evidence." Forensic entomology can even be used in cases of burnt bodies, as insects may still be found, feeding within the body cavities. If a cadaver has been burnt this makes estimating time of death difficult for the pathologist. Between working with police in the UK and research at the Natural History Museum, Amoret also works at the anthropology department at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville. There she compares the decomposition of dead pigs and human cadavers. Some people have nicknamed this place the "body farm". In the summers of 2008 and 2009 she compared the decomposition of three pigs and three human cadavers. Her research isn't finalised but initial results are positive, confirming that pigs are a good model for how a human corpse decays. "The same species of insects are attracted during the same time periods to both types of cadaver.  Large numbers of blowflies from days 1-5, fewer on days 6-7, and a large drop from day eight onwards," she told BBC News. She also says this research will be very useful for all cases where insect evidence is used. "This work will have a big impact when it's published, for forensic entomologists all over the world.  As it will show that pigs are a good model for humans, and therefore all the data gathered using pig cadavers can be applied to cases involving human cadavers." Amoret Whitaker is just one of the scientists demonstrating their research at the one night only event "After Hours: Science Uncovered" at the Natural History Museum on Friday 24th September between 1600 and 2200	At the top of a long staircase in a room in a tower, far away from the throng of visitors and other scientists and laboratories is the Natural History Museum's insectory.
Eric Bikubi, 28, and his partner Magalie Bamu, aged 29, have been convicted at the Old Bailey of killing Kristy Bamu after accusing him of being a sorcerer who practised witchcraft. The couple, who live in Newham, acted after accusing Kristy of controlling and adversely influencing a young boy, the jury was told. They originally came from the Democratic Republic of Congo, where witchcraft is called Kindoki, and exorcisms are carried out in some churches. In 2010, Unicef reported 20,000 children accused of witchcraft were living on the streets of DR Congo's capital Kinshasa. In the DR Congo, accusing a child of being possessed is a criminal offence, a law that has been in place for several years. But in 2008 I travelled to Kinshasa to see if it was making any difference and, at that time, the answer was not at all. Which is why I found myself in one of the city's slums late at night knocking on the door of tin-roofed shack that doubled as a church. Pastor Tsimba let me in and showed me three children who he had diagnosed as having Kindoki. The youngest was probably six, the oldest no more than 12. They had been in the church for days, deprived of food and forced to work. Their parents were paying for the privilege. The only light came from flickering candles and storm lamps. The pastor began to shout and pray. One by one he brought the children up to the front of the church. He ordered them to lie down and, still shouting and chanting, began slapping their stomachs, one, two, three times. Each harder than the last. Then he took a candle and poured burning hot wax on them, leaving them grimacing and squirming but making almost no sound. Their eyes were wide and staring. Finally, as a bizarre conclusion to the ritual, Pastor Tsimba produced a length of pipe and held it hard against their belly buttons. One after another, he made a play of sucking hard on the pipe and in triumph then spat a lump of meat he claimed to have sucked out of them into a bowl. The meat he claimed had been been fed to them by a witch, infecting them with Kindoki. The children, bewildered and quiet, were now in his words "delivered". I alerted a social worker to the plight of the children. An extraordinary and dedicated man, he said he would do all he could to help them. But his unit had not paid him for months, there was no money for petrol or even a bus fare. So he did his work on foot. He walked miles each day, visiting as many churches as he could, in this sprawling city of nine million people.	An "obsession" with witchcraft and sorcery led a couple to brutally murder a 15-year-old boy at a flat in east London.
The Scot, 26, stopped Joubert in the sixth round - a ninth win out of nine. "I had to [get] over the clash of heads and cut in the first round," he told BBC Scotland. "It's a pretty nasty cut. "I learned I can deal with having to get cuts and when it gets rough I can carry on with it. I kept myself nice and calm." The 2014 Glasgow Commonwealth Games gold medallist has previously stated his ambition to fight fellow Scot and WBA super-lightweight champion Ricky Burns. Taylor's promoter, former world champion Barry McGuigan, said: "We'd love that fight. That's a great fight, that's a magnificent fight down the line. "He [Taylor] is impressive. He's so inventive. He's creating his own little style. Taylor has got that uniqueness about him, he's just so inimitable in everything he does. "He's great to watch and he's definitely going to go the whole way. The difficulty for me now is how do I fill the gap between here and world championship fights because that's where he's capable of going? "I need to have something else in the middle because once you make that step, there's no turning back. You can't go back and have easier fights where you can gain experience. That's my dilemma." And Taylor added: "I'm quite happy where I am just now, maybe another defence of the Commonwealth, maybe even knock on the door of the European [title]. "I learned a lot about myself [against Joubert]. I was impressed with my own performance. "I caught him clean a few times and he took them and he came back at me and hit me a couple of times himself. "Once I started finding my range, started catching him with good shots, it didn't take me long once I caught him clean."	Josh Taylor says he "learned a lot about himself" in his Commonwealth super-lightweight title defence against South Africa's Warren Joubert.
US prosecutors had been expressing their wish to put him on trial in a US court since his arrest in February 2014. Guzman, who was named Public Enemy Number One by the Chicago Crime Commission in 2013, has been indicted by at least seven federal district courts. As the head of the Sinaloa cartel, he is accused of overseeing the smuggling of huge amounts of drugs from South and Central America to the United States. He is also facing charges of money laundering, racketeering and arms trafficking in courts as far apart as Arizona and Texas. But since his 2014 arrest in his home state of Sinaloa, Mexico, there has been little movement on the extradition front. While US courts were arguing about who had the best case against Guzman and should therefore get priority putting him on trial, Mexican officials were making it clear they were in no rush to send him across the border. Mexico's attorney general at the time, Jesus Murillo Karam, said as early as April last year that he had "no intention" of handing Guzman over to the US authorities. In an interview with Mexican daily El Universal, Mr Murillo Karam said he was annoyed at a plea bargain an extradited Mexican drug dealer had struck with the US authorities. Jesus Vicente Zambada Niebla, also known as Vicentillo, pleaded guilty in a court in Chicago to smuggling tonnes of cocaine and heroin to the United States. In exchange for promising the US authorities "full and truthful co-operation", his sentence was reduced from a potential life sentence to 10 years. The US authorities believed Vicentillo could prove a key witness if Joaquin Guzman was ever extradited to the United States. The son of Guzman's number two, Ismael "El Mayo" Zambada, and a key player in the drugs trade himself, Vicentillo was seen as a valuable asset. But Mr Murillo Karam said he felt "uncomfortable" with the deals the US reached with "criminals" such as Vicentillo. The then-attorney general pointed out that there were plenty of charges Guzman faced in Mexico as well as in the US and that he wanted to see him tried in his homeland. He reiterated his position in January of this year, when he again stated that he wanted to see Guzman serve his sentence in Mexico first. 'El Chapo [Guzman] has to stay here to serve his sentence and then I'll extradite him. That could be in about 300 to 400 years, there's still a long time to go." At the time, he said that he thought a formal extradition request by the US was imminent, but it seems that following Mr Murillo Karam's strong words, the request was not filed. He argued that keeping Guzman in Mexico was also a question of sovereignty. But Mr Murillo Karam is more likely to regret another statement he made back in January. He said that extradition should be considered in instances where there was a flight risk, something he said did "not exist" in the case of Guzman. Given the fact the Guzman had escaped from another top security jail in 2001 and was on the run for the next 13 years, this was a surprising assurance. Comparisons have been drawn between Joaquin Guzman and the late infamous Colombian drug lord, Pablo Escobar. Both made immense fortunes in the illicit drug trafficking trade, and through bribery and intimidation managed to sway huge power and infiltrate parts of the security forces. Both have also mounted successful and spectacular escapes from jail. It was Pablo Escobar's jail break that played a major part in changing the Colombian approach to extradition. In a 1991 deal with the Colombian authorities, Escobar agreed to hand himself in to the Colombian police and to serve five years in a jail built to his own specifications in his hometown of Medellin. La Catedral (the cathedral), as the luxury jail was known, boasted a football pitch, a jacuzzi and a bar among its many amenities. After little more than a year, Escobar escaped from the jail and went on the run, much like Guzman did on Saturday. He was eventually killed a year later while still on the run. But before he was jailed, Escobar had threatened and cajoled members of a constitutional assembly to enshrine a ban on extraditions in the Colombian constitution. It remained in force until December 1997, when a constitutional amendment reversed the ban. Since then, Colombia has extradited many drug dealers to the United States saying that it is both a cheaper and safer option for the Colombian justice system. Colombian officials argue that in the US, Colombian drug dealers will find it harder to intimidate guards and their families or to access their riches to bribe prison staff. With 30 prison staff and the warden under questioning over the escape of Chapo Guzman at Mexico's Altiplano jail, this argument may well be met with more open ears in Mexico, too, now.	The escape on Saturday of Joaquin Guzman, one of the world's most wanted drug lords, from a maximum-security jail in Mexico, has reignited the discussion about whether he should have been extradited to the United States.
Finance Secretary Mark Drakeford said the idea was "attractive" and could help tackle poverty and inequality. Supporters said it would help unemployed people who fear taking a job would lead to cuts in their benefits. But Patrick Minford from Cardiff University's Business School said it was "not a workable scheme". Under Universal Basic Income (UBI) everyone would receive the same sum of money regardless of whether they work or not. There would be no requirements to show an individual is looking for a job either. In Scotland the policy has support from across the political spectrum, with feasibility work under way ahead of possible pilot schemes in Glasgow and Fife. Jamie Cooke, head of the RSA think tank in Scotland, told the BBC's Sunday Politics Wales programme: "Moving from a system where you aren't working to a system where you are, you won't face those penalties, you retain your consistent payment. "You're given the security to be able to choose to work... or training, or to set up your own business in a way that is beneficial to you." However Prof Minford, who was an adviser to former prime minister Margaret Thatcher, told the programme: "This is not a workable scheme because it's far too expensive. "It creates a tremendous tax, a disincentive for the average person further up the income scale who's paying for it all." Mr Drakeford told the assembly earlier in January he found the idea of UBI "attractive in the way that it can simplify and support people who currently have to rely on a very complex set of part-time work, part-time benefits and so on". But he added: "The political world will face a job of convincing the public about the merits of the scheme." Asked if he was worried by Mr Drakeford's comments, Prof Minford replied: "It's quite worrying for Wales. "I'm hoping Wales won't go the same way [as Scotland] towards this sort of extremely expensive socialist experiment".	Paying everyone in Wales a universal basic income would be a "worrying and extremely expensive socialist experiment", an economist has warned.
After a nervous start, the Gulls grew into the game and started to apply pressure, which nearly paid off in the 14th minute when a powerful shot from Brett Williams struck a post. Luke Young forced a good save from Owen Evans and later went close with a couple of first-half free-kicks. The Gulls started the second half purposefully and finally breached the visitors' defence in the 58th minute when skipper Aman Verma headed home a free-kick after Jordan Lee had been brought down by Mark Gray. Giancarlo Gallifuoco had a goal disallowed in the 65th minute, but the Gulls ensured they will be back in the National League next season when Myles Anderson headed home two minutes from time.

Media playback is not supported on this device Kubica suffered a partially severed right hand in a rally accident on the eve of the 2011 season and has not recovered enough movement to return. "I miss racing in F1, yes," he said in an exclusive BBC Sport interview before this weekend's Canadian Grand Prix. "When you do everything you can to be an F1 driver and suddenly it stops, it's not painful but it's definitely not something you were looking for." Media playback is not supported on this device The Polish driver is competing this year in the European Rally Championship for Citroen and is doing work for the Mercedes F1 team in their simulator as he continues his recovery. He says he is still some way from being able to compete in F1 because of the restricted movement of his arm and fingers. "I have suffered big injuries in the rally crash," the 28-year-old said, "but I am still lucky I am able to drive on a high level, although not any more in F1. "Driving F1 would not be such a big problem, the problem would be to drive a complete race in all circuits but unfortunately that is not possible for now. "The problem in F1 is the space. Maybe one day if the FIA say the car has to be 10-15 cm wider, I can drive - but it is not that rally is second choice. "What is important for me is I am seeing progress. Even if in normal life I struggle with using the hand, [but] driving I see the progress, in the rally car, in the simulator. "The question is how far I will go and how long it will take but to be honest it really doesn't matter if it will take one month, one year or 10 years, maybe one day I will have chance to drive F1 again." Kubica, who won the 2008 Canadian Grand Prix for BMW Sauber and finished eighth in the world championship in his maiden season with Renault in 2010, was considered one of the very best drivers in the sport at the time of his crash. He admitted the past two years had been difficult for him to handle. But asked whether he was still in love with motorsport, he said: "I think more. I was always thinking I was very lucky to be in F1. "I spent a hard time after the accident for many months - I would say maybe even for nearly two years - not just because of the surgeries, the recovery and the pain but afterwards because when you recover you lie down in the hospital, you start missing it and then you realise how much maybe not love but affection you have for the sport." He added: "I paid quite a big price for a mistake but I could have paid a much higher price, that's for sure. "It is unfortunately part of this sport that you have to accept. If you are driving you are not thinking about this. If you don't accept, you don't do it." Kubica made it clear he still prioritised success in F1 over rallying but said he would not try to rush his recovery. He said: "What I learned is that because of my situation I cannot look too much forward. I have to look week after week, day after day and move forward, that's the most important." Watch the interview with Robert Kubica in the build-up to Canadian Grand Prix qualifying from 17:00 BST on Saturday	Former Renault Formula 1 driver Robert Kubica says he misses competing in F1.
First one of the Yazidi women started crying, then one of her friends. And then one of the visitors could be heard stifling a sob. We were listening as a group of Yazidis recounted the now horribly familiar story of how IS came to their homeland on Mount Sinjar in 2014, killing thousands and driving many thousands more into exile. "Some of our neighbours were running away, but before reaching the mountains, Islamic State gangs captured them and took them," one of the women said. "The men were killed, and the women and children taken. "So many died." None of these women wanted to give their name. The experience of two years ago has apparently left them with a deeply ingrained sense of fear - of other people, and of the future: "They might be able to drive Islamic State out of our area, but it would be very difficult for us to return to where we came from, because we're scared something might happen," one of the women said. "They might come back." The possibility of returning is on the minds of many Iraqis, as IS comes under sustained attack in Mosul and is defeated outright elsewhere. But even Yazidis not scared to go home would find it extremely difficult because the city of Sinjar and the villages that surround it have been so thoroughly destroyed. "From houses to roads to bridges, the area is razed to the ground," says Dara Yara, a minister in the Iraqi government, with responsibility for housing and construction. He makes no bones about the long time it will take before they can even start proper rebuilding in the Yazidi areas. "This kind of situation needs peace, stability. This is a long process," he says. For now, many Yazidis languish in refugee camps, contemplating another winter under canvas. Others have given up on the idea of returning home, and have sought asylum in Europe and North America. It is a trend that worries Luqman Suleiman, a teacher, who also takes people round the Yazidis' most holy temple, in the town of Lalish. "They want to go to Germany, to France, to Australia," he says. "There is no future for the Yazidis in Kurdistan." As far as Mr Suleiman is concerned, the problem is not a matter of houses and roads. What will ultimately dissuade Yazidis from returning to their homes and lives on Mount Sinjar, he says, is the fact their own neighbours helped IS. He is one of many Yazidis who insist that Sunni Muslims already living in Sinjar told IS who was Yazidi and who was not. "The people in the villages helped Islamic State kill the men, kill all the men, and take away the girls," he says. "How can people live again together?" No-one is sure how many Yazidi girls were taken away by IS, but a United Nations report suggested it was between 5,000 and 7,000, and that some, perhaps many, were being held as sexual slaves across the border in Syria, but also in Mosul. It is another thought that occupies the minds of Yazidis, as they watch Iraqi army tanks make their way through Mosul's streets. "They are there. Recently, one member escaped, but the others - we don't know," another Yazidi woman says, another who does not want to give her name, lest there be reprisals against members of her family still inside IS-held territory. She was speaking at a rehabilitation centre in Qadia refugee camp, run on behalf of a British charity, The Lotus Flower. Here, Yazidi women are taught various skills, including how to sew. The hope is that this may one day provide them with a source of income, but the manager running the project acknowledges that the main purpose is therapeutic. "We have to help them to be busy with something," says Vian Ahmed, "rather than thinking a lot about what happened to them, about what horrible memories they have." "Islamic State survivors tend to want to be alone. "We are helping them to get out, which will be a benefit to them, psychologically and socially." Of course, what would really benefit the Yazidis would be if they could get out of the refugee camps in which so many of them are living, and for those who want to, to have a chance to see again the villages in which they have lived for so many generations. But that remains a very distant prospect, if not an impossible one.	As so-called Islamic State (IS) militants are driven out of Mosul, Paul Moss reports on the continuing plight of the Yazidis, the Iraqi religious group who the United Nations says has suffered more destruction than any other at IS hands.
Tony McMahon's free-kick deflected into the path of Lee Evans as he gave Bradford the lead from close range. Dale levelled before the break as the ball fell to Peter Vincenti for his sixth goal of the season. Devante Cole restored Bradford's lead just before the hour and an Olly Lancashire own goal two minutes later put the game out of reach. Rochdale manager Keith Hill told BBC Radio Manchester: Media playback is not supported on this device "I have been very disappointed not just today but over the last season of touchline technical etiquette. "I've been very disappointed that the technical area teams are trying to win it from the technical area. "I don't think we lost the game today because the players of the technical area were getting at the referee and fourth official, we've lost the the game today because we made mistakes."	Bradford picked up their first win in five league games as they beat Rochdale at Spotland.
The 23-year-old has scored 24 tries in 37 appearances for the Wolves. He could make his debut for Super League's bottom side in Friday's trip to Hull FC. "With Jordan Tansey having returned to Wakefield, the opportunity for another outside back to come into the squad was there," managing director Richard Thewlis said.	Huddersfield Giants have signed Warrington Wolves winger Gene Ormsby on a one-month loan deal.
Membership of the Labour Party has soared since the general election and Mr Corbyn believes most of these new members are his supporters. The hope of his opponents is that many may have become disillusioned with his leadership. But having spent a day in Leeds meeting new and older members of the local party, I found scant evidence for this. If anything, Mr Corbyn's supporters seem ever more determined to defend him. So who are these new members; the so called "Corbynistas"? I spent time with four of them: Jane Ingham , 65, a retired head teacher, Ged Colgan, 26, a hotel worker, Marvina Newton, 30, a local charity manager and Jane Aitchison, who is in her 40s and is a trade unionist. What quickly became clear was that, not only was Jeremy Corbyn the main reason they joined the Labour Party, but they remain fiercely loyal to him. Mr Corbyn, they believe, offers inspiration and change.  In the past Labour had become too similar to the Conservatives; particularly over austerity, they say. Jeremy Corbyn represented a break with the traditional way of doing politics "He's unlike anyone," says Marvina. "To me that's what is great about him. He speaks from the heart. " What was also clear was the disdain all four had for those Labour MPs seemingly determined to oppose Jeremy Corbyn. "Unfortunately they have been part of a style of politics that has not only failed to win elections but they have been consistently wrong about a whole range of issues," says Ged. Jane the retired head teacher is similarly unimpressed. "I'm quite disappointed with the MPs. Do too many of them have too many privileges and just enjoy the privilege of being members of Parliament?" And there's no disguising the fact these new members are prepared for a fight should Labour MPs continue to refuse to back Mr Corbyn, if he wins this leadership contest. No-one mentions the D-word, deselection. But the warning signs are clear. "It's perfectly legitimate for local members to choose who they want to be their candidate at the next election," warns Ged. "I don't see why being an MP should be treated like a job for life." Jane, the trade unionist, agrees. "They (the MPs) do feel threatened. We represent change and Jeremy represents huge change and that threatens their very cosy position." So what of longer-serving party members? How do they view this influx of pro-Corbyn new members ? Away from the city centre in one of Leeds' more deprived areas, Seacroft, a rock-solid Labour area, I met up with two long-standing party members: Les Wrigglesworth, a former miner, and Melvyn Burton. They both praise the energy and enthusiasm of the new recruits. However they are more cautious over how committed these new members will remain to the Labour Party. Les says they may prove "fair weather" members. They are both dismissive, however, of claims that many of the new members are so-called "entryists" from Trotskyite and other hard-left groups. Les dismisses the idea as a "red herring". There may be a few entryists, he says, but only a tiny minority. Melvyn believes the new members may be "naive" in their views but they are not Trotskyists. It's only a snap shot but my impression is that even those party members who are not supporters of Jeremy Corbyn are far from happy about the challenge to his leadership. Some regard it as a distraction from the business of opposing the Conservatives; others as undemocratic; others still as a precursor to a possible all-out civil war or even split in the party. The difficulty is that Mr Corbyn has become the sticking point. Many Labour MPs believe he threatens Labour's very survival as a credible political party. But if they are hoping the membership is poised to turn against him - I found precious little sign of it in Leeds.	There's no disguising the confidence in Jeremy Corbyn's camp about this leadership election.
He's been disqualified in the final at Queen's Club for kicking out at an advertising panel. But it wasn't just the panel that felt his frustration - the sign broke and cut the leg of a line judge. Nalbandian was disqualified for unsporting behaviour and the match was awarded to his opponent Marin Cilic. After the match, Nalbandian admitted he went too far saying, "I am very sorry, sometimes you get frustrated on court." Maybe he should think about a new career in sport - karate perhaps?	Argentinian tennis player David Nalbandian might be wishing he'd kept a lid on his temper.
The main feature was a drop in bank shares. That came after the news that Deutsche Bank faces a $14bn penalty to settle an investigation by US regulators into the mis-selling of mortgage-backed securities. Shares in RBS fell by 4.4%, Barclays by 2.8% and Standard Chartered by 2.7%. Neil Wilson, from ETX Capital, said the Deutsche case could have serious implications for RBS which was "among a number of European institutions that could face similar claims from the US Department of Justice", he said. "RBS could have to pay up to $13bn to settle the claims. "Even a third of this figure could deliver a crippling blow to the lender, making its return to profitability even further off. It would also derail plans to return the bank to private ownership any time soon," Mr Wilson added. Among the main risers in London were TUI, up nearly 4%; Shire, up 3.2%; and Burberry, up 3%. On the currency markets, the pound fell 1.2% against the dollar to $1.309 and dropped 0.4% against the euro to â‚¬1.1730.	(Close): London share prices fell back slightly, with the FTSE 100 index closing 20 points lower at 6,710, a fall of just 0.3%.
After being reduced to 8-2, they posted a score of 255-7, with Davies and Ben Foakes (90) sharing a stand of 130. Yorkshire's run-chase was undermined by a three-wicket burst in nine balls from Stuart Meaker, whose victims included Jonny Bairstow and Gary Ballance. Tim Bresnan made 68 but was the last to go as they were all out for 236. Having lost to Durham in the T20 Blast semi-finals last weekend, Yorkshire were hoping to atone by reaching Lord's for the first time since 2002. They made the ideal start as Dominic Sibley and Kumar Sangakkara went inside the first three overs, the Sri Lankan making only four before needlessly giving a catch to cover. But they were left to rue Matthew Waite dropping Davies, then on 43, off his own bowling just after having Rory Burns caught on the boundary. Davies went on to hit a six and 10 fours before finally falling to Waite, who took 3-48 and also dropped a more difficult return chance offered by Foakes. After losing Adam Lyth early, Yorkshire were well-placed on 75-2, but fast bowler Meaker (3-61) turned the game on its head by ripping out Bairstow (13), who lobbed tamely to mid-wicket, Ballance (32) and Jack Leaning. Bresnan and Waite (38) did their best to repair the damage, but 27 off the final three overs was too much and Bresnan holed out at long-off with seven balls remaining. Surrey skipper Gareth Batty told BBC Radio London: "Everyone is stepping up to the plate when the team requires, everybody's pulling together. "Davies and Foakes were quite magnificent, that partnership blew the game wide open. "The position we got ourselves to, I thought we should maybe have been 265 or 270. "But we got wickets at the right times and it was always going to be an uphill battle for them once it got down to those final overs." Yorkshire captain Alex Lees: "We are all gutted. We have played some great white-ball cricket this season, but when it has mattered we haven't been good enough. "The bowlers were exceptional and we thought it was a reachable target. We needed someone in the top five to make a contribution and we would have reached the target comfortably."	Opener Steven Davies hit 104 off 116 balls as 2015 runners-up Surrey reached another One-Day Cup final with a 19-run win over Yorkshire at Headingley.
The star is up for the main prize, album of the year, for her ambitious visual album, Lemonade, which tackles themes of race and female identity. Her single Formation is also up for song and record of the year. In all three categories, she is up against Adele - who previously won the ceremony's top three prizes in 2012. Beyonce now has 62 Grammy nominations across her work as a solo artist and as part of Destiny's Child, making her the fourth most-nominated artist ever. She has won 20 trophies altogether, although she has yet to clinch the album of the year prize, having been beaten to the title by Beck in 2015 - much to the disgust of Kanye West, who stormed the stage in protest. West receives eight nominations this year for his album The Life Of Pablo - all in the rap categories. Drake and Rihanna also have eight nominations, including three for their hit collaboration, Work. Making Grammy history is Chicago-born musician Chance The Rapper, whose album Coloring Book is the first streaming-only record to be recognised by the Recording Academy. He achieves seven nominations, including best new artist, without ever releasing a physical album or digital download. Beyonce and Adele go head to head with Justin Bieber, Drake and country star Sturgill Simpson in the best album category. If Adele wins, she will become only the second woman to receive the best album prize twice, after Taylor Swift. Notably absent from the shortlist is David Bowie, who was tipped to win for his critically-acclaimed Blackstar album. The record does make an appearance in the best alternative album category, as does Radiohead's A Moon Shaped Pool. Coldplay have also fared badly, receiving just one nomination - best music video - despite selling millions of copies of their latest album, A Head Full Of Dreams. Prince receives a posthumous nomination for his final album, Hit N Run Phase Two, in the best engineered, non-classical category, where Blackstar also makes the shortlist. British star James Corden will host the 2017 Grammy Awards, which take place at the Staples Center in Los Angeles on Sunday, 12 February.

Darren Grayson has stepped down from the East Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust, which runs the Conquest Hospital in St Leonards and Eastbourne District General Hospital (EDGH). In March the Care Quality Commission said A&E waiting times were "excessive" and targets were being missed. Campaigners have called for the resignation of the board of the trust. Mr Grayson said: "Having been chief executive in East Sussex for five years, and having led the organisation through some significant change to improve the quality of our services for patients, I believe the time is now right to hand the baton to the next leader to continue this journey of improvement." In its latest report in March, the CQC said it had particular concerns over outpatient records and surgical practices at the EDGH. Liz Walke, chairwoman of the Save the DGH Campaign, said: "It's a start. Let's be clear, that it isn't just Darren Grayson. We think the board should go and, unless you have a clean sweep, no significant change will happen. "We hope there isn't going to be a massive payout. We are hoping that he has just fallen on his sword." Former Liberal Democrat MP for Eastbourne Stephen Lloyd said: "It's about time. "Frankly, I called for it a good 18 months ago. He still appeared to be hanging on for grim death to the post. I just thought it was absolutely outrageous."	The chief executive of two Sussex hospitals, which the health watchdog said were inadequate, has resigned.
Just as David Letterman had his painfully awkward "Uma, Oprah" routine and Seth Macfarlane his catastrophically misjudged song We Saw Your Boobs, Harris will be recalled mostly as the guy who presented in his pants. It was certainly an arresting image, the How I Met Your Mother star clad only in socks, shoes and what are referred to in America as "tighty whiteys." It was a reference to a scene from Birdman, and - like any time Johnny Depp sings - you had to admire the courage, if not the execution. And at least it was memorable, unlike almost anything Harris actually said. Bafflingly, given the amount of potential material to work with - the Sony hack; the Interview row; the #OscarsSoWhite Twitter campaign - the script saw Harris referring to Reese Witherspoon as someone he could eat "with a spoon." The actor was one of a team of 12 Oscar writers. Just think - one of them worked on that humdinger. The other 11 approved it. Even more puzzling, things had started brilliantly. The first line was by far the best - "tonight we honour Hollywood's best and whitest - sorry, brightest" - a reference to the #OscarsSoWhite debate that followed the nominations. Then there was the opening song, about the wonder of "moving pictures", featuring Harris, Anna Kendrick and Jack Black - and dancing Stormtroopers. Harris, a Tony Award-winner on Broadway, pulled it off like Steve Martin or Billy Crystal at their best, putting himself into classic movie scenes while pulling off clever rhymes like "Argo / And Fargo / Or when Marty made his car go". Having nailed it, he turned to the camera and smiled. "That whole thing? Completely improvised." It was pretty much the last big laugh he achieved. From there on, flat setups began crashing into flubbed punchlines with the alacrity of a drunk sailor inviting the entire pub to have a go if they think they're hard enough. There was a predictable joke about Harvey Weinstein (there always is); a bit where he started to talk to the seat fillers and then seemed to immediately lose heart; a routine about his Oscar predictions so laboured it was on the verge of setting up its own union. By halfway through there was terror in Harris' eyes whenever the camera came to him. A part where he asked David Oyelowo to read an insult about the remake of Annie - which had recast the lead with a black actress - was fist-gnawingly uncomfortable. It's worth noting, however, that it was this undercurrent of racial politics that gave the night its most memorable moments. Oyelowo was in tears as he listened to the performance of Glory by John Legend and Common from Selma. It was an intense, powerful performance which had the entire audience on their feet as it finished. When Glory shortly afterwards gained Legend and Common (under their real names of John Stephens and Lonnie Lynn) the best song trophy, they electrified with a passionate joint speech. "Nina Simone said it was an artist's duty to reflect the times we live. Selma may be 50 years ago, but it is now, because the struggle for justice is right now," they insisted, and the music that normally strikes up to urge the winners off the stage stayed silent. Indeed it was a night for politics. Best Actress Patricia Arquette called for equality for women; Best Adapted Screenplay winner Graham Moore urged young people confused about their sexuality to "stay weird"; Best Director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu spoke about the Mexicans "who came before and built this incredible immigrant nation". Meanwhile, at the end - in every sense - Harris fluffed a gag about mispronouncing Chiwetel Ejiofor's name. In the context of what had preceded it, it struck a particularly flat note. The Oscars aren't going to stop being seen as white and elitist if every year the writers insist on mining this seam of "exotic names are weird and hard to say." That is hardly Harris' fault. Nevertheless, it really did highlight the contrast of the night: That between black politics and white pants.	Neil Patrick Harris' debut turn as Oscars host was one of the most forgettable for years - although one moment will define him forever.
The jazz film is the follow up to director Damien Chazelle's Academy Award-winning film Whiplash. The People's Choice, voted for by the audience, has proved to be a decent predictor for Oscars success in recent years. Previous winners include 12 Years a Slave and The King's Speech. La La Land, set for release in December, stars Stone as an aspiring actress in Los Angeles who meets a jazz pianist (Gosling) who is trying to stay true to the music he has devoted himself to. The film also stars singer John Legend and JK Simmons, who won an Oscar for best supporting actor for his performance in Whiplash. La La Land has enjoyed rave reviews since premiering at the Venice Film Festival in August. Chazelle wrote the script six years ago but was not able to persuade anyone to make it until he broke through with Whiplash in 2014. Stone, who won the best actress prize at Venice for her La La Land role, previously starred with Gosling in Crazy, Stupid, Love. Toronto's Platform prize for international directors was won by Pablo Larrain for Jackie, the Jacqueline Kennedy biopic starring Natalie Portman. Raoul Peck won the People's Choice documentary award for I Am Not Your Negro, which follows the lives and assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr, Malcolm X and Medgar Evers. The film is based on James Baldwin's unfinished book, Remember This House. Follow us on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, on Instagram, or if you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.

Rosberg was 0.275 seconds quicker than Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen, with the Red Bulls of Max Verstappen and Daniel Ricciardo close behind. Hamilton failed to complete a clean lap on his qualifying simulation on the ultra-soft tyres and ended up seventh. He finished his session early because of a recurring hydraulic problem. Hamilton was unable to do any of the race-simulation runs the teams do in the second part of the session on heavy fuel loads. He was also unhappy with the balance of the car on the ultra-soft tyre that was used for the fastest runs, although Mercedes believe they should be able to solve that problem with set-up changes. Hamilton, who is two points ahead of Rosberg in the world championship, is nevertheless heading into the weekend at a disadvantage. However, he can console himself with the knowledge that he had been fastest of all after the first runs in the session were complete, before he started to run into difficulties. "We had a small hydraulic issue at the end of FP2 but it doesn't look like anything serious," said Hamilton. "The guys are working on it and it should be fine for tomorrow, which is the main thing." Media playback is not supported on this device The evidence of the day was that Mercedes are not struggling in the same way as they did last year in Singapore, when their previously dominant car was more than a second off the pace of Ferrari and Red Bull. Listen again: A look ahead to the Singapore Grand Prix But, considering the long 3.15-mile lap, the margin between the world champions and their closest challengers is much smaller than normal. Verstappen was 0.380secs off Rosberg's pace, with Ricciardo just 0.025secs further adrift after recovering from a spin during which he brushed the wall without major damage. Verstappen was running a Renault engine upgrade which will not be available to Ricciardo until Saturday and which team boss Christian Horner said was expected to be worth in the region of 0.1secs a lap. And on race pace, Red Bull appeared to have an advantage but the picture was not completely clear. "We knew they wouldn't have a massive gap here this weekend," said Ricciardo. "We know if we get it right we can be very close in qualifying." Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel was fifth quickest after an unconvincing qualifying simulation run, 0.7secs slower than Raikkonen and a second slower than Rosberg. Vettel's problems put him back in the mix with the midfield runners, headed by Force India's Nico Hulkenberg in sixth. Toro Rosso's Carlos Sainz was eighth, ahead of Fernando Alonso's McLaren, a position with which the former champions are likely to be a little disappointed. They expected to be battling for seventh behind the big three, but Alonso was 0.6secs slower than Hulkenberg. The Spaniard's team-mate Jenson Button, meanwhile, was struggling - he was three places and a whopping 0.795secs behind Alonso, who is admittedly at his absolute best around the challenging Singapore track. Alonso had to park his car on track at the end of the session after encountering a gearbox problem. Englishman Jolyon Palmer was 17th fastest, just 0.005secs behind Renault team-mate Kevin Magnussen as both men fight for their future in F1.

A monthly travelcard costs £135 ($174), according to a Deutsche Bank report - £33 ($43) more than Dublin, which was ranked second priciest city. Auckland, where a ticket costs £95 ($123), came third, while New York City, at £91 ($118), came fourth, and Tokyo fifth at £86 ($111). Transport for London (TfL) said the findings did "not show the true cost of transport in other countries". The survey also found the cost of travel in the capital dropped since 2014, when commuters paid £165 ($213). Source: Deutsche Bank Its authors ranked London tenth most expensive for petrol, and the third for car hire. Hong Kong had the priciest petrol, while Amsterdam was the most expensive for a daily car rental, the report said. London's taxis fared slightly better, ranked 20th in a list of 47 cities, with Zurich topping the list for the most expensive fares. For quality of life, London was ranked 33rd in the world, similar to other "mega cities" such as Tokyo, Paris and New York. According to the report, these cities "rank very low" for quality of life, mostly due to "high living costs, crime, pollution and commuting time". "This is highly subjective and one person's long commute may be another person's chance to catch up on Netflix," the report said. "Megacity dwellers may also forsake short-term quality of life for aspirational reasons," the report added. Wellington, in New Zealand, was ranked as the best city to live in in terms of quality of life, followed by Edinburgh, Vienna. Melbourne and Zurich. In February, TfL revealed its fares income was down £90m last year. TfL is currently planning to cut £16bn from its budget by 2020/21 as it  aims to become self sufficient with its operating costs. The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has frozen fares on buses and trams until 2020, but travelcard prices are set by train operating companies and so are not under full TfL control. A TfL spokesman said: "London also has one of the most extensive set of travel concessions in the world with free or discounted travel for children, the over-60s, students and veterans."	Public transport in London is the world's most expensive, a report says.
A journalist and stock market officials are among those arrested, Xinhua said. It gave no other details. Chinese shares fell by nearly 8% after a week of volatile trading that spread fear to global markets. The Tianjin explosions killed 150 people - with 23 still missing. A total of 367 people remain in hospital after the 12 August blast at a warehouse where large amounts of toxic chemicals were stored. Twenty are in critical condition, according to Xinhua. Separately, the UK's Financial Times says Chinese leaders feel they mishandled their stock market rescue efforts. The paper, quoting an account of a meeting of senior regulatory officials on Thursday, said the government had decided to abandon attempts to boost the stock market and instead step up efforts to punish people suspected of "destabilising the market". Chinese authorities tightly control information online and have previously prosecuted internet users for spreading rumours. The rumours described by the latest statement include reports that a man had jumped to his death in Beijing due to the stock market slump and that as many as 1,300 people were killed in Tianjin blasts, Xinhua said. The news agency said "seditious rumours about China's upcoming commemorations of the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II" were also among the offences. A journalist was also arrested along with several stock market officials, according to a Xinhua report. The journalist, Wang Xiaolu, is accused of "spreading fake information" about the market slump, the report said. The state news agency said Mr Wang confessed that he "wrote fake report on Chinese stock market based on hearsay and his own subjective guesses without conducting due verifications". In 2013 Chinese authorities introduced a possible three-year sentence for spreading rumours - the sentence was supposed to apply to anyone who posted a rumour that was reposted 500 times or viewed 5,000 times. Last year, Qin Zhihui, a blogger, was sentenced to three years in a government crackdown on internet rumours. Mr Qin was found guilty of "slander" and "picking quarrels and provoking troubles", state broadcaster CCTV said at the time.	Chinese authorities have punished 197 people for spreading rumours online about the recent stock market crash and fatal explosions in Tianjin, according to state news agency Xinhua.
The panther chameleon was found on Monday by a dog walker in the wooded area at Marl Park. It had to be put down after X-rays showed all of its legs were broken and it had a deformed spine. RSPCA Cymru said it was an "extremely sad example of an abandoned and neglected exotic pet". Inspector Selina Chan said: "It is a possibility that the owners took on this animal but were unable to provide the care he needs and decided to release him to the wild. "We are urging potential owners of exotic animals to thoroughly research what is required in the care of the particular species before taking one on. "Potential owners need to make sure they can give their animal the environment it needs and they have the facilities, time, financial means and long-term commitment to maintain a good standard of care, as required under the Animal Welfare Act 2006." She added it was illegal to release non-native species into the wild.	Owners of exotic animals have been urged to do research before having them as pets after a seriously neglected chameleon was found in Cardiff Bay.
The admission comes a day after mSpy told BBC News it had not been hacked and no data had been stolen. It has also emerged that the UK's Information Commissioner is investigating the company. It told the BBC it was "aware of the breach and is trying to find out where the company is based". MSpy offers software it says is aimed at parents worried about what their children are up to online and employers who want to legitimately track their employees. But it is also used for more nefarious purposes, such as spouses spying on their partners. Security expert Brian Krebs broke the news that a vast vault of highly personal data from mSpy customers had been dumped on the so-called dark web - an area of the internet that cannot be reached by traditional search engines. He had been contacted by an anonymous source who had sent him a link to the data on a Tor-based site - technology that allows people to mask the identity of their websites. BBC News has now also been sent links to the data, which it is currently analysing. After insisting that the data was fake and no breach had taken place, mSpy has now admitted that data had been stolen. "Much to our regret, we must inform you that data leakage has actually taken place," spokeswoman Amelie Ross told BBC News. "However, the scope and format of the aforesaid information is way too exaggerated." She said that 80,000 customers had been affected. Initial reports suggested up to 400,000 customer details had been exposed. "Naturally, we have communicated with our customers whose data could have been stolen, and described them a situation.  We put in place all the necessary remedial measures and continue to work on mechanism of data encryption," she added. Mr Krebs said that he had also contacted "multiple customers of mSpy" via the link he had been sent. "I spent the better part of the day today pulling customer records from the hundreds of gigabytes of data leaked from mSpy. I spoke with multiple customers whose payment and personal data â€” and that of their kids, employees and significant others â€” were included in the huge cache. All confirmed they are or were recently paying customers of mSpy," he wrote in his blog. Katherine Till, one of the customers contacted by Mr Krebs, confirmed to him that she and her husband had paid mSpy to monitor the mobile device of their 14-year-old daughter. She told the security expert that she was unaware of any breach. "This is disturbing, because who knows what someone could do with all that data from her phone," she told Mr Krebs. Another user whose financial and personal data was in the cache asked not to be identified but told the security expert that he had paid mSpy to secretly monitor the mobile device of a "friend." The Information Commissioner's Office advised customers worried that their data might have been exposed to contact mSpy in the first instance. "If they get no joy with the company, they can get in touch with us," a spokesman said. Its initial investigation is aimed at finding out whether the company, which has a London office, is based in the UK. The BBC has been told the company is based in California. The company is also under fire in the US, with Minnesota senator Al Franken describing the software as "nothing short of terrifying" and  likening it to "stalking apps". He wants the government to investigate the company and has written to the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission. He writes: "I believe every American has a fundamental right to privacy, which includes the right to control whether and with whom personal, sensitive information - including location data - is being shared."	A company offering software that allows people to spy on others has admitted it has been hacked and had thousands of customer records leaked online.
The star of TV series Dexter and Six Feet Under, Hall played the lead role in Bowie's musical Lazarus, which premiered shortly before his death. He will perform the title song, which opens with the line: "Look up here, I'm in heaven", and was widely interpreted as Bowie's personal epitaph. The song also appears on Bowie's Mercury-nominated Blackstar album. Other nominees include Laura Mvula, The 1975, Kano and Bat For Lashes. Radiohead are also shortlisted for their album A Moon Shaped Pool. It is their fifth nomination - but they have yet to win the Â£25,000 prize. The band, who are on a brief break from their world tour, are not expected to perform at the ceremony, but most of the other acts will appear. On the night, the 12 nominated albums will be cut down to six finalists, one of whom will be chosen by a public vote. A panel of judges, including Jarvis Cocker, Annie Mac and Wolf Alice frontwoman Ellie Rowsell, will then choose the overall winner.

Immigration, healthcare and outreach to Latino voters dominated the debate, which disintegrated into long periods of shouting and personal insults. Mr Trump has won three of the first four contests held so far. Next week's vote in 11 states is held on what is known as Super Tuesday. The three men are seeking to be named as the Republican candidate in November's presidential election. At long last the Republican candidates have come to the realisation that Donald Trump can actually win this race, but it may be too late. For more than two hours, Senators Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz took turns throwing punches at the New Yorker. They attacked him on his business record; they mentioned hypocrisy; they questioned his conservative credentials; and they criticised the lack of detail in his policies and his reliance on bluster. "We're having a lot of fun up here, aren't we?" the front-runner quipped at one point. But the truth is that Mr Trump was on his heels for much of the evening. The challenge for the men who would unseat the leader, however, is that the best time to bludgeon a candidate is before it is clear circumstances are forcing you to act. In a campaign where authenticity is worshipped above all, Thursday's fireworks could smack of the kind of political expediency many associate with traditional politicians. Both Mr Cruz and Mr Rubio drew blood with their attacks but Mr Trump will be likely to emerge unbowed. How Cruz and Rubio double-teamed Trump What makes Super Tuesday super? - The long day of voting explained The Republicans who hate Trump - Lifelong members of the party speak out Mr Rubio, who has come second in several recent contests, mounted a series of attacks on Mr Trump. "If he hadn't inherited $200m, you know where Donald Trump would be?" Mr Rubio said in one tense exchange. "Selling watches in Manhattan." Mr Rubio also criticised Mr Trump's failed online education venture, Trump University, and assailed him for hiring foreign workers rather than Americans in his construction projects. Mr Trump shot back: "I hired tens of thousands of people. You've hired nobody." The billionaire real estate mogul found himself increasingly on the defensive about his business dealings and his conservative credentials. In other exchanges The fruit salad of their life is what I will look at. Trump on Rubio: "This guy's a choke artist [not able to deliver on stage]." Rubio to Trump: "You're a lousy businessman." "If he hadn't inherited $200m, you know where Donald Trump would be right now, selling watches in Manhattan." Trump to Cruz: "This guy is a liar." Cruz response: "Falsely accusing someone of lying is itself a lie, and it's something Donald does daily." Trump to Cruz: "You get along with nobody. You don't have one Republican senator backing you. Not oneâ€¦You should be ashamed of yourself." "I know you're embarrassed." Rubio to Trump: "You're the only person on this stage that's ever been fined for hiring people to work on your projects illegally." Trump response: "I'm the only one on the stage that's hired people. I've hired tens of thousands of people over my job. You've hired nobody. You've had nothing but problems with your credit cards." Mr Trump has been extremely popular despite his controversial comments about deporting millions of undocumented workers and banning Muslims from travelling to the US. He is currently leading in 10 out of 11 states holding contests on Super Tuesday when a quarter of the total numbers of delegates needed to secure the Republican nomination will be up for grabs. He has 82 Republican party delegates, Mr Cruz has 17 and Mr Rubio has 16. To become the Republican party's nominee, a candidate has to have 1,237 total state delegates. On the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders will compete for 1,004 delegates on Super Tuesday. Mrs Clinton has a clear lead with 505 delegates, but the majority are super delegates who can change their mind during the course of the campaign. Mr Sanders has secured 71 delegates in the first three races. Each party formally announces its presidential candidate at conventions in July, four months before the presidential election. 27 February - South Carolina primary (Democratic) 1 March - "Super Tuesday" - 15 states or territories decide 18-21 July - Republican convention, nominee picked 25-28 July - Democratic convention, nominee picked 8 November - US presidential elections In depth: Primary calendar How does the US election work?

Members of the Clwyd North Division are against the changes at Glan Clwyd Hospital, Bodelwyddan. These could see clinical staff transferred to Ysbyty Gwynedd and Wrexham Maelor hospitals from 6 April. Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board said it was "disappointed" by the vote. Doctors, who held the vote after discussing the plans at a meeting on Monday, said the recent decision to withdraw consultant-led obstetric and gynaecology services at the hospital for 18 months has left them feeling demeaned. Dr Richard Lewis, secretary of the Welsh British Medical Association, said that following a number of high-profile resignations at the board two years ago after a damning report on management failings, communications between the board and the wards remained poor. "The situation in terms of the board's ability to communicate with its frontline staff are as bad if not worse than ever," he told BBC Wales. "That gap seems not be closing; in fact on this particular issue it seems to be widening, which is a real worry." Health board executive medical director Prof Matthew Makin said: "We fully acknowledge the strength of feeling regarding the board's decision from our clinicians but maintain that our primary motivation for making this pre-emptive urgent interim change is to protect the safety of mothers and babies." Meanwhile, AMs in the Welsh assembly agreed a motion on Wednesday calling on the health board to "ensure the continuity of consultant-led maternity and other women's clinical services at each of the three district general hospitals in north Wales". Conservative health spokesman Darren Millar, AM for Clwyd West, said: "I welcome the fact that not a single Assembly Member voted against our motion to protect maternity services from the threat of downgrading."	Doctors unhappy at proposals to close consultant-led obstetrics and gynaecology services at a north Wales hospital have passed a vote of no confidence in the health board.
Yorkshire Sculpture Park said 100,000 people visited in September when the poppies were installed, compared with about 37,000 last year. The poppy arch segment, Wave, consists of 5,800 ceramic poppies falling from Cascade Bridge into the Lower Lake. Park entry on Remembrance Sunday and Armistice Day will be by ticket only. Yorkshire Sculpture Park said visitor numbers would be restricted on 8 and 11 November "to ensure a calm and contemplative experience for all". Belinda Eldridge, operations manager, said the 170% rise in visitor numbers was "phenomenal" and Yorkshire Sculpture Park was expecting its biggest ever year, with more than half a million visitors. "We feel extremely privileged to be able to bring the poppies to Yorkshire," she said. "It's safe to say tens of thousands of people are coming as a result of the poppies." She said the sculpture had a "different feel" from any other sculpture at the park, and many people found seeing the poppies was a "calm and contemplative experience". The installation is part of a nationwide tour of poppies from the artwork Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red, which was unveiled in London in July 2014. The artwork, created by artist Paul Cummins and designer Tom Piper, marked 100 years since the start of World War One and drew more than five million visitors. The Yorkshire Regiment raised 24 Battalions served by 65,000 men, of whom 9,000 died.	A sculpture park near Wakefield has reported a 170% rise in visitors since poppies from the Tower of London went on show in September.

Local MP Ian Lucas said people were concerned about the impact it could have if the prison on Wrexham Industrial Estate assumes a local name. In a letter, prisons minister Jeremy Wright says local names are "generally avoided as most local people object". He said it was likely people would be invited to propose names for the Â£212m prison which is due to open in 2017. Work is expected to start in August, creating up to 1,000 jobs, to build the prison which will house 2,100 inmates, making it the largest prison in the UK. The overall project spend is lower than the original Â£250m estimate and the construction will involve local business and enterprises, with 100 apprenticeships created.	Wrexham's new super-prison is unlikely to be named after the county borough, says the prison minister.
More than 100 people have been arrested as officers were attacked, police vehicles damaged and shops looted. Disorder spread to Enfield, Walthamstow and Waltham Forest in north London and to Brixton in the south of the city. Home Secretary Teresa May has cut short her holiday to return to the UK following the disorder. Some 35 officers have been injured over the two nights of rioting. Three officers were hurt when a vehicle hit them as they tried to make an arrest in Waltham Forest, east London. Clashes broke out in Enfield, north London, on Sunday evening where shop windows were smashed and a police car damaged. There have been reports of a gang of up to 200 youths looting shops and charging police in Coldharbour Lane and the High Street in Brixton, south London. Metropolitan Police Commander Adrian Hanstock said: "This is not groups of people acting on behalf of communities or with any consent. "This is individuals who are actually attacking communities, businesses, properties and houses and actually causing a huge amount of upset and criminality." The Met said it had dealt with several incidents of "copycat criminal activity" across the city. These included: Kit Malthouse, Deputy Mayor of London and Chair of the Metropolitan Police Authority, described the scenes of the last two nights as "disgusting and shocking" and said the police did a good job. He added: "Obviously there are people in this city, sadly, who are intent on violence, who are looking for the opportunity to steal and set fire to buildings and create a sense of mayhem, whether they're anarchists or part of organised gangs or just feral youth frankly, who fancy a new pair of trainers." Talking about the impact on the capital's image, one year ahead of the Olympic Games, he said: "It's pretty rotten for London, it does not look good. "What we need to do over the next few months is to underline to people the fundamental truth about London which is that it is one of the safest, great big cities on earth. "We have a low murder rate and this kind of violence is very rare." The Home Secretary, Theresa May said: "Last night, police officers again put themselves in harm's way to protect Londoners and their property. "Londoners have made clear that there are no excuses for violence, and I call on all members of local communities to work constructively with the police to help them bring these criminals to justice." BBC London's Paraic O'Brien said he had witnessed widespread looting in Brixton. He said: "They smashed a William Hill, they set bins on fire. "And now what we're seeing as the night progresses is that replicated, sort of flashpoints all along Brixton High Street. By Andy MooreBBC News I saw the rioting in Tottenham on Saturday and I saw the rioting last night and it was certainly different in character. What might have been started in Tottenham by youngsters aggrieved about what they saw as police persecution has become something very different in nature. Last night there was a sense that the looting, and violence and disorder across London was being co-ordinated on social media. There were people in their cars, youngsters on bicycles, moving very rapidly, leaving a trail of destruction behind them. As soon as you moved to one location they would move on to the next one. The police were doing their best to catch up with them. You had police vehicles going backwards and forwards, blue lights flashing, riot police coming out of their vehicles. Ten minutes later they'd get back in again and go off to the next location - essentially trying to fight the fires, metaphorically, that were spreading all over London. "I'm standing outside Halfords on the other side of the road and they've just smashed through the doors of Halfords. They're taking bikes out the front entrance. "I have to say, what really struck me was the small number of police officers that there actually seem to be on Brixton High Street responding to this." Press Association photographer Lewis Whyld saw looters battle police at a Currys store in Brixton. He said: "A couple of hundred youths were rioting and looting. Riot police went in to get them out and there was a big fight in the street. "Youths were throwing rocks and bottles and there was a bin on fire. They used a fire extinguisher to push the police back so they could get back into Currys and continue taking things out." Met Police Commander Christine Jones said: "Officers are shocked at the outrageous level of violence directed against them. "At least nine officers were injured overnight in addition to the 26 injured on Saturday night." London Fire Brigade said it had been called to a number of fires in Enfield, Brixton and Walthamstow, including a fire at a shop on Brixton Road, which is now under control. The disorder follows rioting in Tottenham which broke out on Saturday night and continued into Sunday morning. A peaceful protest over the fatal shooting by police on Thursday of 29-year-old Mark Duggan descended into violence later in the evening. The unrest spread into nearby Wood Green and Tottenham Hale. Shops were attacked and looted, 26 police officers and three others were injured and buildings and vehicles were set alight. Tottenham Hotspur Football Club's ticket office was also damaged during the violence. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Steve Kavanagh told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme that there were too few officers in Tottenham on Saturday night, but blamed Twitter for fuelling looting and violence, saying: "Social media and other methods have been used to organise these levels of greed and criminality." Mr Kavanagh pledged that more officers would be on London's streets on Monday night to prevent or tackle further outbreaks. Parts of Tottenham are still cordoned off, as officers and forensic specialists continue to examine the riot scene. A total of 61 arrests have been made in connection with the first night of rioting. The majority were for burglary, and other offences including violent disorder, robbery, theft and handling stolen goods. Sixteen people have been charged for offences including burglary, violent disorder and possession of a pointed or bladed weapon following the Tottenham riots. As well as Mr Duggan, a police officer was also shot in Thursday's incident, which happened in what was called a "pre-planned" event, under Operation Trident, which investigates gun crime in London's African and Caribbean communities. Police had stopped a minicab which Mr Duggan had been travelling in. The violence has also affected public transport and the roads. This includes:	Police have condemned a wave of "copycat criminal activity" across London in a second night of looting and disorder following riots in Tottenham.
Wilson's side were demolished by 101 runs against Hampshire on Tuesday. But Wilson said they were not too worried about a one-off defeat and instead took heart from their form throughout the group stage. "It's disappointing to go out one step away from Finals Day and we'll come back next year," said Wilson. "We will take pride from the brand of cricket we've played throughout the competition." Derbyshire were the surprise package of this season's T20 Blast, finishing second in the North Group having reached the quarter-finals only once before. "We were all desperate to get over the line and get down to Birmingham," Wilson told BBC Radio Derby. "We won't accept that a quarter-final is good enough. "But, moving forward, it could be an exciting time for us and the challenge will be to go one step further."	Derbyshire captain Gary Wilson has said his side will be back in contention for T20 Finals Day next season after their quarter-final defeat to Hampshire.
Wa-ays Dhaye, 18, died from multiple knife wounds after being attacked in Thurston Street, Slough, in August. He was walking home after spending the day at Notting Hill Carnival. Khianni Gordon was jailed for life with a minimum of 19 years for murder while Kaneel Huggins and Antwon Clarke were given 10 and nine-year sentences respectively for manslaughter. Gordon, 18, was also convicted of perverting the course of justice. Clarke and Huggins' sentences were referred to the Court of Appeal by the Attorney General under the Unduly Lenient Sentence scheme. Huggins, 19, had his sentence increased to 16 years, and Clarke, 18, had his sentence increased to 15 years. Gordon's sentence was not considered by the court. Speaking after the hearing, Attorney General Jeremy Wright said: "These offenders knowingly participated in the plan to assault and injure Wa'ays Dhaye knowing full well that really serious harm or death could be caused. "Knife crime is a real scourge of our society and it's important that prison terms for this type of crime reflect the seriousness of the offending." Mr Dhaye, who was born in Holland but lived in Slough for 10 years, was stabbed while walking home after spending August bank holiday at the Notting Hill Carnival. He died later in hospital. Det Ch Insp Kevin Brown of Thames Valley Police, said the three had "hunted down" Mr Dhaye following a minor altercation between two groups at the carnival. He said: "The three of them left Wa-ays dying in the street and it was members of the public who found him and came to his aid." Update 21 November 2016: This story has been amended following updated information supplied by the Attorney General about the sentencing	Two men from High Wycombe jailed for a fatal stabbing have had their sentences increased by the Court of Appeal.
They were made 110 years ago by the Wall family who lived in New Southgate in North London. There are 24 clear recordings on wax cylinders which were made using a phonograph machine between 1902 and 1917. Music curators say the sound quality of the music recorded is outstanding. The recordings were found at the former home of David Brown, Cromwell Wall's grandson, in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire and donated to St Neot's Museum. It was then discovered that the recordings were made in London. Cromwell Wall's great-great grandchildren, Layla and Zac Jordan, from Sandy in Bedfordshire, heard the recordings for the first time when they visited the Museum of London. Cromwell and Minnie Wall had nine children, eight of whom appear on the recordings. All the recordings are bursting with vibrancy and life, according to Julia Hoffbrand who is the curator at the Museum of London who helped restore the recordings. "When I first heard the recordings the hairs on my arms stood on end," she said. "It was fantastic. We had an idea of what was on the recordings because Cromwell had written very full descriptions on the cylinder boxes but it was really like a window opening into the past. It was like being in the same room as the family and their friends". Many of the recordings were made at family gatherings over Christmas and New Year. Cromwell Wall, who made the recordings, wheeled the phonograph along the streets in his children's pram in order to record the sound of Old Southgate Church bells pealing out New Year. Some of the later recordings were made during WWI when three of the sons, who feature in earlier recordings were away at war. One son, Oliver, died of pneumonia in a French hospital three weeks before peace was declared. The recordings were restored this summer and many of the relatives heard them for the first time in October. It brought back some great memories for Oliver Wall, one of Cromwell's grandchildren. "It was a wonderful atmosphere. I remember the occasions always at Christmas and we always had big parties and singing round the piano with grandpa playing and he used to take us marching upstairs and all over the big house they had." His cousin Daphne reminisces how their grandfather used to dress up as Father Christmas. "There was a great deal of excitement," she said. "It was fun!" It is very unusual for recordings on wax phonograph cylinders to survive for so long. Phonographs were introduced for use in offices as dictating machines and so it is extremely rare for them to be used to record domestic sounds and occasions. "We were thrilled," says Julia Hoffbrand. "Phonographs and cylinders were expensive so you had to have a certain level of income to record and a level of skill and care to make recordings and to take care of the cylinders." The cylinders themselves are similar to old fashioned vinyl records in that the phonograph would make indentations into the cylinder which could then be replayed.  Bill Lowry, digital collections manager at the Museum was among those who helped restore the cylinders. "We tried to reduce any noise by cleaning the cylinder first with a fine brush that can get in between the groove and once we had the best playback from the cylinder we then digitally cleaned them up."

The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said the reasons included a rise in the cost of pensioner benefits, and an increase in housing benefit spend. It said Chancellor George Osborne could need to make more spending cuts "just to stay on track". The Treasury said its plan was "securing a resilient economy". The IFS said changes to benefits and tax credits had been expected to save £19bn compared with "a world of no policy change". Explaining why spending had in fact reduced by £2.5bn in real terms, it said: "All this has important fiscal consequences," said the report's author, Andrew Hood, adding that slow earnings growth could push up spending. "Mr Osborne wants further cuts to social security spending to help reduce the deficit. He may end up having to make cuts just to stay on track." The IFS study comes after Labour released figures it said showed the government had spent £25bn more on social security than the amount it had predicted in November 2010. The party commissioned the House of Commons Library to compare forecasts made in the 2010 Autumn Statement with how much the coalition had spent since then and intends to spend this year. Writing on the PoliticsHome website, shadow chancellor Ed Balls and shadow work and pensions secretary Rachel Reeves said savings from welfare cuts had been outweighed by a failure to tackle the causes of rising social security spending. They wrote: "A key cause of the Tories' overspending is their failure to make the economy work for working people, leaving thousands more reliant on housing benefit." But the Treasury rejected this analysis. A spokesman said: "The government's long term economic plan is working, cutting the deficit by a third and already delivering over 70% of the £126bn consolidation set for this Parliament. "At Budget 2013 we announced a cap on total welfare spending for 2015 to 2016 onwards, bringing over £100bn of spending under new controls. "However, the impact of the great recession is still being felt in the economy and public finances, which is why we need to keep working through the plan that's securing a resilient economy." Green Party leader Natalie Bennett pointed to a report from the London School of Economics and the University of Essex that said the poorest groups had lost the largest share of their incomes on average as a result of coalition government policies. She said: "This report once again goes to prove that Osborne's ideologically-driven austerity economics are simply not working." The Treasury said analysis of annual budget statements had shown the richest households were "making the biggest contribution to reducing the deficit".	Welfare spending over the course of this Parliament has fallen by just £2.5bn despite reforms aimed at saving £19bn, economic forecasters say.
Speaking to Huw Edwards on The Wales Report, Andrew RT Davies defended his party from criticism that it simply opposes Labour policies rather than putting forward its own programme for government. "At every juncture we bring forward an alternative, we don't just criticise," he said. "There is a clear agenda for what the Welsh Conservatives stand for, and it's action. "It's action to improve the economy, it's action to improve public services in Wales and it's action to strengthen communities the length and breadth of Wales." Asked about his priority if the Tories won power after the assembly election in May, Mr Davies said: "The first spending commitment is protecting the NHS budget for the lifetime of this parliament, or the assembly's term, the five years. "I would suggest that the outcomes in Wales regrettably aren't as good as we want them to be. "And we want to make sure those outcomes are improved. "That's why we've called for an independent Keogh-style enquiry into the NHS here in Wales so we can make those improvements, not on political whims, but led by clinicians themselves telling us what we need to be doing to improve the health service here in Wales." Prof Sir Bruce Keogh investigated 14 NHS trusts in England for a review into higher-than-expected hospital death rates, published in 2013. Speaking about the Wales Bill on further devolution, the Welsh Conservative leader praised Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb's handling of the legislation, put on hold on Monday after MPs called for a re-think. It followed claims that the draft bill was confusing, and would leave Welsh ministers with fewer powers rather than more. Mr Davies said: "The secretary of state deserves huge credit; for instead of ploughing on with this bill, actually saying 'I've listened to what people have said to me'. "Actually, the Welsh Labour government could learn a lot from this legislative process." First Minister Carwyn Jones had called Monday's announcement on the Wales Bill an "avoidable delay to clear up an avoidable mess".	Labour has been "ploughing on as if they have a divine right to rule" in Wales, the Welsh Conservative leader has said.
The Senegal international, 26, joined for £9m from Lille in July 2015 and played 35 times as Villa were relegated from the Premier League last season. Other interested clubs have until the end of July to make a bid for Gueye. "If he wants to go, we are powerless," club chairman Dr Tony Xia posted on Twitter. Gueye only missed three league games for Villa in 2015-16 and scored his only goal for the club in their FA Cup fourth round win against Wycombe in January. It is believed the fee that has activated the departure clause is about £7m, with Villa bracing themselves for further offers.	Aston Villa cannot stop midfielder Idrissa Gueye leaving the club after Everton triggered a release clause in the player's contract.
Character actor Wallach - who began his film career in 1956 after 10 years on stage - was admired for his wide range in a career spanning six decades. His portrayal of bandit chief Calvera in The Magnificent Seven was regarded by many as his definitive role. When he received an honorary Oscar in 2011, he was described as a "quintessential chameleon". Though he was never nominated for an Oscar during his 60-year career, the Academy rewarded him in 2011 for "effortlessly inhabiting a wide range of characters, while putting his inimitable stamp on every role". His films included the classic westerns How the West Was Won and The Misfits. Arguably best known for his villains, he made a lasting impression as Tuco opposite Clint Eastwood, in Sergio Leone's 1966 spaghetti western The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. Years later, Wallach said strangers would recognise him and start whistling the distinctive theme tune. "As an actor I've played more bandits, thieves, warlords, molesters and mafioso than you could shake a stick at," the Hollywood Reporter quoted him as saying. He was also successful in light comedy and appeared in many TV shows, including playing Mr Freeze for a spell in the 1960s Batman TV series. The veteran star continued making films into his 90s, making his last big screen appearance in Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps in 2010. His death was confirmed by his daughter Katherine in the New York Times. Wallach was born on 7 December 1915 in Brooklyn to Polish Jewish immigrants. He graduated from the University of Texas, initially intending to become a teacher. But his focus shifted to acting, and after serving in World War II he studied at the Actors' Studio, where he became a practitioner of method acting. He first appeared on the New York stage in 1945, where he met his wife Anne Jackson, to whom he was married for 65 years. Wallach made his London debut in 1954 with The Teahouse of the August Moon. His screen debut came two years later, playing an unscrupulous seducer in Baby Doll. The role earned him a Golden Globe nomination for best supporting actor and a Bafta award for most promising newcomer. But the theatre remained Wallach's first love. "For actors, movies are a means to an end,'' he told the New York Times in 1973. ''I go and get on a horse in Spain for 10 weeks, and I have enough cushion to come back and do a play.'' He became a household name as Calvera in 1960's The Magnificent Seven, alongside Yul Brynner, Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson and James Coburn. He went on to earn an Emmy in 1967 for his supporting turn in the drama Poppies Are Also Flowers, and picked up four further nominations - most recently for his guest turns in Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip (2007) and Nurse Jackie (2010). Other notable roles came in How the West Was Won, Mystic River, The Holiday, Lord Jim, and The Godfather: Part III, playing an ill-fated Mafioso. Asked about possible retirement, he told the Times in 1997: ''What else am I going to do? I love to act."	Eli Wallach, whose films included The Magnificent Seven and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, has died aged 98.
The airport is in competition with Heathrow to win approval for an additional runway. One of the guarantees is compensation for people living close to the airport. Gatwick's chairman Sir Roy McNulty said: "These guarantees would mean Gatwick takes on the main risks of building the new runway." The Airports Commission is currently considering three options for expanding airport provision in south-east England and is due to publish its findings in the summer. These options are a third runway at Heathrow, lengthening an existing runway at Heathrow or a second runway at Gatwick. Gatwick has "guaranteed" the project would be privately funded with no need for public subsidy, that airport charges would be capped and it would bear the main risks of the expansion plan. It has also promised to compensate residents by Â£1,000 towards council tax bills if they are affected by significant level of aircraft noise, and said it would ensure that air quality targets always were always met.	Bosses at Gatwick Airport have unveiled five "guarantees" they hope will convince the Airports Commission to approve a second runway.
South Wales Police said 39-year-old Angharad Bullock was reported missing on 28 April, along with the toddler. Officers are concerned for the welfare of the pair.	Police are searching for a woman who has gone missing with her three-year-old son.
The 24-year-old made four centuries, and Anthony Hamilton two, as the pair completed a record six consecutive tons when they met on Wednesday. Wilson said he was "way below his best" as he got to the semi-finals in Berlin. "But playing like that was the perfect antidote," he told BBC Sport. "It's the best match I've ever played by far, and setting the record is brilliant." The previous record of five was jointly held by Ronnie O'Sullivan and Stephen Hendry in the 2003 British Open final, and Stephen Maguire and Neil Robertson in the quarter-finals of the 2009 Masters. World number 20 Wilson came from behind on three occasions to reach the last four at the German Open in Berlin but said having to "do it the hard way" finally caught up with him. The Kettering man won final-frame thrillers against Rory McLeod, Michael Holt and Ryan Day but lost to Belgium's Luca Brecel 6-3. "I was absolutely gutted with the way things ended in Berlin," said Wilson. "It will take a while to completely forget that one. I didn't play well and was just scrapping to get through. "But I wasn't going to mope about. There has to be positives from reaching the semi-finals of a ranking event when you are not playing well. I showed a lot of bottle, but it was probably one match too far in the end. It took a lot out of me. "I got back on the practice table as soon as I could. There's no way I want that to happen again." The Kettering potter's response on his return to competitive snooker was emphatic. He hit breaks of 103 and 108 to go 2-1 up in the best-of-nine meeting with Hamilton. The Nottingham man responded with a 137 and, after Wilson's 125, Hamilton made it 3-3 with a 123. But Wilson hit a 100 for his fourth ton of an astonishing match, before closing out the win with a 68. "I was actually gutted that I missed the last red in the final frame when I could have made it seven," he said.	Kyren Wilson says his record-breaking feat during the "best match of my career" in the China Open qualifiers was the ideal response to his "gutting" display in the German Open.
Management body NHS Employers has given the plan the green light after advisers said there were a range of extra tasks they could do with more training. A Nuffield Trust review found examples of nurses filling in for hospital doctors and pharmacists for GPs. But unions warned against using it as a quick fix for problems in the NHS. It has been well documented that there are gaps in junior doctor rotas, while GPs are struggling to cope with the rising number of patients coming through their doors. NHS Employers asked the Nuffield Trust to look at ways the 1.3 million-strong workforce could be reshaped to help. The think tank highlighted examples of areas that were already experimenting. These included: The report said as well as helping cover for doctor shortages, such moves made sense because of the changing nature of care, with much more stress on looking after people with long-term conditions such as diabetes and heart disease rather than curing them. It said that as doctors only made up about one in 10 of the workforce much more was needed from other health staff, but the Nuffield Trust admitted money would need to be set aside to ensure it happened. Are nurses the new doctors? NHS short of front-line staff, MPs say Report author Candace Imison said there were "huge opportunities" in reshaping the workforce, in both improving patient care and providing staff with more rewarding roles. And NHS Employers chief executive Danny Mortimer said: "Our challenge now is to take forward the learning and recommendations in the report." But British Medical Association leader Dr Mark Porter said while he supported increasing the skills of the workforce, this should not be done "at the expense of good quality training for doctors or indeed doctors themselves". "It takes doctors many years to learn how to provide the best care for their patients, and there is no substitute for this kind of expertise and experience," he said. "There should be more staff support for doctors to help them coordinate the best possible care for their patients." And Unison head of health Christina McAnea said the squeeze on funding in the health service meant there was "all too often" no funding for training courses. "Developing the NHS support workforce must not be seen as a quick and cheap fix for the chronic shortages of nurses and other health workers across the country," she added.

Dana was transported to the Al-Mawa reserve via Turkey along with four other lions, two bears and two tigers in a three-month operation organised by the animal welfare charity Four Paws. Staff found the cub, who they named Hajar, in her cage on Saturday. They are now waiting to see whether Dana will give birth to a second cub. Dr Amir Khalil, a vet who accompanied the animals, told the Associated Press on Sunday that an ultrasound performed in Turkey had shown she was carrying two. However, he warned that the second cub might already have been born dead and been eaten by Dana. Its fate will not be known until another ultrasound is carried out on Monday. Four Paws said its team had initially been very concerned about whether Dana would accept or kill Hajar because of the enormous stress she had endured. "But luckily that wasn't the case. She cleaned the cub and nursed it," the charity added. "This is a true sign that she feels safe at Al-Mawa." Hajar's gender is unknown because staff have not been able to examine the cub.	A lioness rescued from a zoo in the war-torn Syrian city of Aleppo has given birth just hours after arriving at a wildlife park in Jordan.
That was a 20% increase on the same period last year. The profit was achieved on turnover of £152m, up from £117m the previous year. First Derivatives makes financial analysis software used by investment banks all over the world and the firm now employs more than 1,750 people.

Messi, who had not scored in Barca's first two league games, started on the bench after missing training on Friday to be with his new baby boy Mateo. Atletico went ahead six minutes after the break when Fernando Torres rolled in a shot, but Neymar equalised. Messi then grabbed the winner after being set up by Luis Suarez. It was the Argentina international's 287th La Liga goal for Barcelona, extending his lead as the competition's all-time top scorer. His goal came on the day that Real Madrid forward Cristiano Ronaldo became his club's record league scorer - and moved up to fourth in the overall standings with 230 goals - by scoring five in a 6-0 win at Espanyol. Messi had scored in Argentina's 2-2 midweek draw with Mexico but was seeking his first La Liga goal of the season before Saturday's game. He saw Suarez hit the bar in a poor first half, before Atletico took the lead early in the second when Torres finished off a fine counter-attack. That lead lasted only four minutes, though, as Neymar curled in a stunning free-kick from 20 yards. Barcelona had a penalty appeal rejected when Atletico defender Diego Godin appeared to handle the ball, but Messi won the match with a stylish, low finish.	Lionel Messi celebrated the birth of his second son with a winning goal as Barcelona went top of La Liga with a 2-1 win at Atletico Madrid.
Anthony Storrie died on 30 June 2013 at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley after taking "N-bombs". The 26-year-old had been arrested the night before for an alleged police assault while under the influence of the drug, which is now illegal. A fatal accident inquiry heard he had suffered damage to his liver while "crashing about" in his flat. Sheriff Principal Duncan Murray ruled there was no evidence Storrie, of Paisley, had been assaulted by police officers or his friends. He said: "The N-bomb caused Mr Storrie to be in the agitated state. "The effects of the N-bomb then prevented him from being able to give any explanation of the injury which he had sustained. "Nonetheless, Mr Storrie's death would in all probability not have occurred had he not taken N-bomb. "Mr Storrie's death is a stark reminder of the risks posed by drug-taking. "It is clear from the evidence presented to this inquiry that N-bomb is a potent compound producing significant hallucinogenic effects. "It is also apparent from the evidence given by experienced consultants in emergency medicine of the significant risks posed to those taking cocktails of drugs in uncertain dosages and of uncertain chemical composition or purity." Drugs expert Dr Richard Stevenson had told the inquiry that the effects of the drug would have made it impossible for Storrie to properly describe his injuries. He said Storrie was in a state of "excited delirium" when he was admitted to hospital and was suffering from a range of physical phenomena which contributed to his death. The inquiry heard the cause of death was recorded as "blunt force trauma" stemming from a cut to the liver which was caused by an abdominal haemorrhage. The trauma and injuries including broken ribs were caused by a blow "the equivalent to being kicked by a horse or driving at speed in a car without a seatbelt, crashing and hitting the steering wheel". Dr Stevenson, an A&E doctor at Glasgow's Royal Infirmary, said Storrie's symptoms meant he was "about to die" when he was taken to hospital for treatment. He said that by taking the hallucinogenic drug, which is similar to LSD, he had "life-threateningly low" blood pressure, a racing heart, and an increased body temperature.	A man who died in police custody would still be alive if he hadn't taken a so-called legal high, a sheriff has ruled.
Media playback is not supported on this device The Frenchman, 25, died on Friday as a result of head injuries suffered in a crash at the 2014 Japanese Grand Prix. Chilton, who raced with Bianchi at Marussia in 2013 and 2014, dominated the race at Iowa Speedway to earn his first win in any series since 2012. "I probably thought of Bianchi every five or 10 laps," said Chilton, 24. "He was a driver destined to probably be a world champion," he added. The Briton said he had learned of Bianchi's death on Friday night US time before going on to take a victory which saw him lead for 87 of the 100 laps at the 0.894-mile oval. Chilton's win came as a surprise as he was sitting 10th out of 15 drivers in Indy Lights going into the weekend. This was Chilton's ninth race in Indy Lights, his previous best finish being third. Bianchi had been in a coma since crashing his Marussia into a recovery vehicle at October's rain-hit race in Suzuka. "It's been a difficult nine months, to be brutally honest with you,'' Chilton said. "I've learned a lot from him and he was part of that win.' As well as racing as Marussia team-mates for two years, the pair also competed in karting from the age of 10 before rising through the racing ranks together. The Briton tweeted yesterday: "No words can describe what his family & the sport have lost. All I can say is it was a pleasure knowing and racing you."	Ex-Marussia driver Max Chilton dedicated his victory in the Indy Lights race on Saturday to his friend and former team-mate Jules Bianchi.

No-one here is in any doubt that Boko Haram did it. It seems people do not know where to vent their anger now but hostility hangs in the air. Inside the mosque, the sight is shocking. Beyond the blood-soaked steps, the floor is strewn with debris: scattered prayer mats, beads, smashed spectacles and pages from the Koran. There are bullet marks on the pillars and the suicide bombers' blood can be seen splattered across the walls and right up inside the dome. "We heard a loud sound outside, but people said let's continue praying," said Adamu Magashi, who was inside facing the imam who had just finished his sermon at the time of the attack. "Then a bomb went off right inside the mosque and somebody started shooting. We tried to move towards the imam and there was another blast - we couldn't even see each other as we tried to escape," he told me after returning to the scene. Outside, a large crowd stands over the twisted remains of the motorbikes and bicycles that were engulfed in the flames when the first bomber struck, driving a car into the assembled worshippers. Policemen occasionally disperse the agitated throng. Another crowd stares at a collection of blackened shoes that has been gathered up in the large open sandy area in front of the green domed mosque. "This was the first time ever the five daily prayers were not observed in this mosque," one shocked man, who has often prayed here, told me, describing the attack as unimaginable. On Friday, the terror swiftly turned to fury when three of the gunmen were overpowered right outside the mosque. They were beaten and burnt to death. Had their lives been spared, they could have provided useful intelligence on the group behind the violence - not that the police have a good record of investigating and prosecuting. Boko Haram's former leader Mohammed Yusuf was killed when in police custody in 2009. At one of the hospitals, where the hundreds of injured are being treated, the police had to intervene to stop a mob lynching a man who had somehow caused fury by taking a photograph. By targeting such a prominent place of worship, the jihadists have sent shockwaves right across Nigeria. This was not just another attack - Boko Haram seemed to be stating it had no respect for the way Islam is practised here. The people of Kano have been shocked and traumatised before by bombers and gunmen working in tandem. This was by no means the first Boko Haram attack on a mosque. But it was possibly the most devastating. And whilst some have portrayed the Boko Haram insurgency as a war on Christianity, this attack is yet another stark reminder that the vast majority of victims in the conflict have been Muslims. Back in April 2007, a high-profile Muslim cleric was killed in Kano.  Sheikh Ja'afar Mahmoud Adam, was gunned down as he prayed at a mosque here after criticising the group's hardline ideology. Seven years on and the list of targets has grown to include policemen, soldiers, government workers, schoolchildren, teachers, vigilantes, entire barracks as well as towns and villages that have recently been captured by the Islamist insurgents. Anyone who does not subscribe to Boko Haram's own interpretation of Islam is a potential victim. The mosque is situated right next to the emir of Kano's palace and is where the outspoken Mohammed Sanusi II regularly preaches. Some people suggest it is no coincidence that the jihadists chose this mosque. Just last week, in the very same building, the emir warned people not to rely on protection by the military, urging them to defend themselves against attacks by the insurgents. "If people flee the villages, the terrorists slaughter our male children and abduct our girls to force them in to slavery," he said. He was out of the country when the gunmen and bombers struck, but he returned on Saturday, visited the mosque twice and sounded defiant. "We will never be intimidated into abandoning our religion, which is the intention of the attackers," he said. He later lead evening prayers at the bloody scene. As trucks take away the debris, people are now cleaning up the mosque ready to pray again. But the jihadist attacks are so relentless that no-one knows where they will strike next. In the 10 days prior to the Kano attack, 188 people were killed by Boko Haram in four separate attacks.  And those are just the incidents we heard about. The loss of life here is on a staggering scale, but the politicians hardly mention it.  There's a presidential vote in February, and election fever takes precedence.	The tension is palpable in Kano, after bombers and gunmen struck killing more than 100 people at the central mosque.
The France player's emoji was shown on advertising boards around the pitch in his side's 1-1 draw with Liverpool. Pogba, 23, missed a first-half chance and conceded a penalty at Old Trafford. "Social media is part of the game now," said forward Ibrahimovic, who scored the late equaliser on Sunday. Pogba, who re-signed for United for a world-record £89m in August, referred to his performance against the Reds with a Facebook post on Monday, saying: "I'd like to thank the supporters who are always there and keep believing in me. At least we did not lose." Former Sweden striker Ibrahimovic, 35, has 4.3m followers on Twitter, which is 1.24m more than Pogba. "I think Paul likes the pressure because without it, we would not be on our toes," said Ibrahimovic. "If you want to play at the top, the pressure is 24 hours and if you play well the pressure becomes even greater." Ibrahimovic said pressure from the press and fans has little impact on top players, adding that he personally puts more pressure on himself. "I want to be more than perfect, in every game and even in training," he added. Ibrahimovic's equaliser on Sunday was his 14th Premier League goal of the season. It puts the former Barcelona and Inter Milan forward level with Chelsea's Diego Costa and Alexis Sanchez of Arsenal at the top of the Premier League Golden Boot standings. "Me winning something and not my team-mates is not the way I want it," he added. "I'd prefer Manchester United to be first in the table and me to have five goals with the media saying 'He can't do it in the Premier League'. I am here to win."

Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba would not have felt any extra pressure on Sunday after launching his own Twitter emoji, according to team-mate Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
Tigers are fifth after a season of struggle which has seen them sack director of rugby Richard Cockerill. They are in danger of missing out on a top-four finish in the league for the first time since the 2003-04 season. "There's a lot more to come from this team," Murphy told BBC Leicester Sport. "Hopefully the Anglo-Welsh Cup can be the catalyst to kick on in the Premiership. There is a long way to go in the season. "I am confident we can make the top four and challenge when everyone is looking around and saying 'what are you doing here?' We can answer that emphatically." Tigers are a point behind fourth-placed Bath with five games remaining, but 11 adrift of Saracens who are third. They have lost seven of their 17 matches, but welcome respite has come in the Anglo-Welsh Cup where they beat Saracens 32-10 in Saturday's semi-final. Murphy, who is part of Aaron Mauger's backroom set-up and has been on the coaching team since retiring in 2013 after 16 seasons as a Tigers player, has taken on a leading role in this season's competition. The 38-year-old said the players fully deserved their place in the final at Twickenham Stoop. "A lot of people have been saying, 'Hold on a second. How did you guys get here? That wasn't in the script'," he said. "We have been really good so far in the competition. We have picked some young guys, some inexperienced guys and some players who haven't had a lot of field time. "We have developed a hell of a lot. We have had different styles of wins. Our opening win against Bath was really tenacious; we had to dig in and fight for everything and we won by a point. "We had a good win against Newport at home where we put some scores on and played more attractive rugby. And we had a tight win against Saints. "We went away to Saracens in the pool stages and lost, but the most impressive thing for me was that we learned the lessons from that game. We went back down there at the weekend and executed a game plan and got into the final. Our forwards had a great game. "The consistent thing from the players who have taken the field is they have been really passionate and have worked hard for each other. "One of the things we have asked of them is to be able look at each other at the end of the game and know they have given it absolutely everything. So far that has been the case."	Leicester Tigers assistant coach Geordan Murphy says victory in Sunday's Anglo-Welsh Cup final against Exeter would be a big boost for their Premiership play-off aspirations.
Liberal Democrat AM Eluned Parrott said the Welsh government had "wasted" more than £52,000 on them at railway stations in south Wales. She accused ministers of spending public money to "promote themselves before an election". The Welsh government said it was unapologetic about the campaign. A spokesman said: "We are not going to apologise for informing the Welsh public about one of the most important economic and social projects in Wales' history. "Are the Liberal Democrats really saying that we should not be providing people in Wales with this important information?" Ms Parrott said her party backed the project, but added: "To all intents and purposes, here we have Labour ministers spending over £50,000 of public money to promote themselves before an election. "This is money spent only on marketing the fact that one day, years in the future, there will be a Metro in south Wales. "This is a cynical way of spending public money. The minister is wasting tens of thousands of pounds on a useless poster campaign." Work on the Metro is set to start in 2017 and finish in 2020, a government spokesman said. Formal consultation for the £600m programme to develop an integrated network of rail, bus and light rail services begins in 2016.	An advertising campaign promoting the South Wales Metro has been criticised as "useless" and a "cynical way of spending public money".
The 79-year-old West Ham chairman was sent a tweet by a prankster, asking to spread awareness of a "missing" Hammers fan. Gold obliged, only for the fan to turn out to be West Ham winger Michail Antonio. Antonio, 25, cost the Hammers £7m when he arrived from Nottingham Forest on transfer deadline day - but he has made just one appearance for Slaven Bilic's team, coming on as a substitute in the 2-1 win at Manchester City on 19 September. Gold has since deleted the tweet, but the prankster has pinned a screen grab to the top of his Twitter timeline. The lesson - think before you retweet.	David Gold thought he was doing a good deed, but instead was found guilty of not recognising one of his own players.
The 35-year-old has been released by Brighton & Hove Albion after they fell short in their bid for promotion. "Maybe if I drop down a division, I'll not feature, but it's ifs, buts and maybes," the defender said of his international future. "It is up to me to keep fit and keep playing and see where it takes me." Greer, who won his 11th cap after starting in Saturday's 3-0 defeat by France in Metz, has no idea where he will be playing when Scotland start their World Cup qualifying campaign against Malta in September. "Hopefully I'll get something and I'll be fit and ready for the qualifiers," said the centre-half who did not win his first cap until he turned 32. "I am open to anything. I would like anything with a good opportunity where teams are pushing for something." Greer had spent six years at Brighton after leaving Swindon Town but found himself out of Chris Hughton's starting XI after January. Injuries led to a recall for their final game of the season against Middlesbrough, when a 1-1 draw denied Brighton automatic promotion, and he retained his place for the play-off semi-final defeat by Sheffield Wednesday. The lengthy inactivity meant he was thankful for more game time against France despite being on the receiving end of a heavy defeat. "It was very tough," said the former Clyde, Blackburn Rovers, Kilmarnock and Doncaster Rovers centre-half. "They are a very good team, got a lot of good players and we found it difficult at times. "But it was good to go out there and get 90 minutes against some of the top players in the world, so it was interesting." Scotland had lost 1-0 to Italy six days earlier and failed to fire a shot on target in either of the two friendlies against sides preparing for the Euro 2016 finals in France. Greer was not one of those questioning the decision to play two very strong teams at the end of a long domestic season. "Ultimately, as a footballer, you want to be playing out there against some of the best players in a great atmosphere because that's what you train for all season," he stressed. "We've got some talented players coming through and I think it was really worthwhile for them as well. "France are obviously at a different stage of their preparation going into the Euros and everybody's playing for places. "We went out there and gave it everything, but we just fell short against a fantastic team."	Gordon Greer has a double mission this summer - find a new club and one that is good enough to help him retain his place in the Scotland team.
Officers received a report of an attack on a woman, 19, at Gorsedd Gardens near Cardiff Civic Centre at 04:30 BST on Thursday. Police said the man, 23, from Cardiff, had been arrested on suspicion of sexual assault. He has been taken to Cardiff Bay police station.	A man has been arrested in connection with an alleged sex attack at gardens in Cardiff city centre.
The Northern Ireland international, 28, was charged on 29 July with breaching FA rule E8, which bars professional players from betting on football-related matters. The offence took place on 20 February. Lafferty made one league appearance for Norwich last season, and played six times for Birmingham City on loan. He was an unused substitute as Norwich started their Championship season with a 4-1 win over Blackburn on Saturday. Rule E8 prevents professional players not only from betting on matches in which they are involved or have an influence, but also on any other football-related matter anywhere in the world - including matches, the transfer of players, employment of managers, team selection or disciplinary matters.	Norwich City striker Kyle Lafferty has been fined £23,000 and warned as to his future conduct after accepting a Football Association betting charge.
The Reds looked in control when Roberto Firmino converted James Milner's pass and Daniel Sturridge backheeled to Sadio Mane to clip home a second. But Leicester were given hope when Lucas inexplicably passed the ball to Jamie Vardy to shoot into an empty net. However, Adam Lallana sealed the win by firing a shot into the top corner and Firmino got a second from Mane's pass. Jurgen Klopp's Reds are up to seven points from four games, having played their first three matches on the road because of the expansion of Anfield's Main Stand. Meanwhile, Leicester remain on four points as they prepare for their Champions League debut against Club Brugge on Wednesday. Liverpool keeper Simon Mignolet picked up blood injuries to his nose and then eye, but he lasted the 90 minutes with summer signing Loris Karius remaining on the bench. Liverpool, as has often been the case under Klopp, looked brilliant in stages, especially in the first 35 minutes when they could have been out of sight. Their opener was a good passing move, which ended in left-back Milner playing a great ball through to Firmino, who stepped inside Robert Huth to steer the ball into the bottom corner. The Foxes defence were again caught out by Jordan Henderson's ball forward for the second and Sturridge squared it with his heel for Mane to score on his home debut. But there will be cause for concern as Brazilian midfielder Lucas started at centre-back, with Mamadou Sakho not in the squad, and he let Leicester back into the game. He miscontrolled a simple pass from Mignolet and - under pressure and in a panic - played the ball across goal to Vardy, who just had to tap into an unguarded net. That gave Leicester hope and they could have had an equaliser when Robert Huth headed a Luis Hernandez long throw-in off the bar. Luckily for the Reds, they got their act together in the second half and Lallana scored his second goal in a week, after his England winner against Slovakia, to wrap up the win, from Georginio Wijnaldum's lay-off. And they added a late fourth when Kasper Schmeichel - who made seven saves in an otherwise good performance - came flying out of his goal with Mane rounding him and unselfishly passing to Firmino to steer the ball past several Leicester defenders. Media playback is not supported on this device Media playback is not supported on this device After record deadline day signing Islam Slimani only returned from Algeria duty on Friday night, Leicester boss Claudio Ranieri decided to wait before giving the striker his debut. Leicester lined up with 10 of their 11 regular starters from last season's title-winning team, with Daniel Amartey in for N'Golo Kante, who was sold to Chelsea earlier this summer. And they were outplayed throughout the game, with their only good spell inspired by Lucas' mistake. Ranieri's side only had three shots on target, including the goal, with Vardy also forcing a save from Mignolet from Riyad Mahrez's ball forward. Last season that combination ended so often in a goal - but this year they might need new ideas, so Ranieri will be eager for £29m Slimani to give them fresh impetus up front. Former Foxes captain Matt Elliott, in his role as BBC Radio Leicester summariser, said: "I didn't see anybody have a glaring howler of a game for Leicester, it was more of a general lack of quality. "At times last year maybe the intensity was a little bit more, and the opposition weren't as good as Liverpool, Manchester United, Manchester City are going to be this season." The game was played in front of Anfield's biggest crowd since 1977, with a 54,000 sell-out in the newly expanded stadium. Some 8,500 seats were added to the Main Stand this summer. Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp told BBC Sport: "It was a tough game against a really strong opponent. "This team is really capable of a lot of exciting things. We played quick but then we conceded and had to show we could fight and stay in the game. "I don't think about where we can reach. We have to be really strong in this league. We have had four away games to begin with, so let's go for it, enjoy it and today I saw some really wonderful things." Leicester boss Claudio Ranieri: "Liverpool played well and deserved to win. We started well, but after the first goal we lost our shape a little. "We tried in the second half, but everything Liverpool tried came good. We created chances, but were a little unlucky. "We have to clear our minds for the next match. When we have lost in the past, we have always had a good reaction." Leicester play their first ever Champions League match on Wednesday, when they go to Club Brugge in their Group G opener (19:45 BST kick-off). They host Burnley in the Premier League next Saturday (15:00). Liverpool do not have any European football this season, with their next match coming at Chelsea on Friday in the league (20:00).

Coffins representing two men and two women who resisted the Nazis in World War Two were carried through the French capital before being interred. The coffins contained only soil from the fighters' graves as their relatives did not want their bodies disturbed. French President Francois Hollande said the group "embodied the spirit of the Resistance". A ceremony was held at the Pantheon alongside the coffins of Germaine Tillion, Genevieve de Gaulle-Anthonioz, Pierre Brossolette and Jean Zay. Tillion, who died in 2008, and de Gaulle-Anthonioz, a niece of former French leader Charles de Gaulle who died in 2002, were caught and deported to the Ravensbruck concentration camp in Germany. Brossolette, a radio journalist who broadcast on the BBC during the war, committed suicide after being arrested and tortured in 1944. Zay, who was minister of education before the war, was killed in 1944, having tried to set up a government-in-exile in north Africa. "Faced with the occupation, with submission, they gave the same response," Mr Hollande said. "They said 'no', immediately, firmly, clearly." Mr Hollande drew parallels with those who marched in French cities on January 11 this year, days after terror attacks on the Charlie Hebdo newspaper and a kosher supermarket. The induction now sees three women interred at the Pantheon, after the scientist Marie Curie. There are now 74 men interred at the mausoleum, the first being the writer Victor Hugo.	France has honoured four members of the French Resistance with a ceremony at the Pantheon mausoleum in Paris.
Its shares slid 7.6% to their lowest level since March, and the company was the biggest faller on the FTSE 100, the UK's main share index. Operating profit before transformation costs for the six months to 25 September fell 5% to £320m from £342m. Royal Mail is now seeking cost savings of £600m a year, up from a previous target of £500m. Royal Mail reported a 1% rise in revenue to £4.6bn for the half year to 25 September, but analysts said this was lower than forecast. The trend of fewer letters being sent through the post continued, with total letter revenues falling by 3%, although parcel revenues grew by 3%. "The fall in the volume of letters and an 8% dip in marketing mail after the Brexit vote in June is causing concern about what can be assumed going forward," said David Kerstens, equity analyst at Jefferies. He added that pension costs were set to rise sharply and that cost savings would be very hard to achieve without sacrificing quality of service. Moya Greene, Royal Mail's chief executive. said the Christmas period would be crucial for the full-year results. "Extensive planning, which began in the spring, will help us to manage our busiest time," she said. "This includes the recruitment of over 19,000 temporary staff and opening nine temporary parcel sort centres." Also on Thursday, Royal Mail competitor UK Mail - which is being bought by Deutsche Post - said half-year revenues had fallen to £230m from £237m a year earlier, although pre-tax profits rose to £5.8m from £2.2m.	Royal Mail shares have fallen after the company reported lower profits and increased its target for cost savings.
Guinea finish bottom of Group A having needed a win against Argentina to have any chance of progressing. In the other Group A match England advanced to the last 16 with a 1-0 win over South Korea, who also go through. Guinea earned their only point of the tournament with a 1-1 draw with England on Tuesday. They began their campaign with a 3-0 loss to hosts South Korea. Marcelo Torres opened the scoring for Argentina after 33 minutes and Lautaro Martinez added a second just before half-time. Matias Zaracho and Marco Senesi scored one each in the second half before Martinez completed the scoring.	Argentina thrashed Guinea 5-0 on Friday at the Under-20 World Cup in South Korea to knock the African side out of the tournament.
Lord O'Donnell told the Times it would take Parliament "years and years and years" to separate fully from Brussels. "It very much depends what happens to public opinion and whether the EU changes before then," he said. He later told the BBC he did not think the EU would make the radical changes needed for the UK to remain a member. As Gus O'Donnell, he was cabinet secretary from 2005 to 2011 and is now a crossbencher in the House of Lords. Lord O'Donnell told the Times: "Lots of people will say 'we've had the referendum, we've decided to go out, so that's it, it's all over'. "It might be that the broader, more loosely aligned group is something that the UK is happy being a member of." Asked about these comments, he told BBC Radio 4 this was an example of a "low-probability event that might mean we don't leave". He also said his "central assumption" was that the EU would not radically change. "The probability of us not leaving is very, very low and we need to get on and implement the people's decision," he added. Lord O'Donnell said making Brexit happen would be difficult, partly because article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty - the step required to officially begin the process - was designed "in a way that is very strongly in favour of those who are staying, not the leaving party". He said he "wouldn't be in a rush" to trigger article 50, as the government must first work out a "strategic plan to say 'what kind of UK do we want, what's our place in the world, what are we trying to achieve in these negotiations'". Handling Brexit would be an "unprecedented challenge" for the government and the civil service, he added. In his interview in the Times, Lord O'Donnell said Theresa May - who replaced David Cameron as prime minister after the UK public voted by 52% to 48% to leave the EU - now faced a "really difficult job". "She's got to corral all these different individuals, come up with precisely what version of Brexit we want, what works best for the British people, and then go about implementing it," he said. He said he was "not a big fan of referenda", adding that there were "ridiculous claims" on both sides in the UK's debate on EU membership. Mrs May has said formal talks on Britain's "sensible and orderly departure" from the EU will not begin until next year - but she has been clear that "Brexit means Brexit". Gus O'Donnell served as a press secretary under John Major, and then as cabinet secretary - the UK's most senior civil servant - in the cabinets of Tony Blair, Gordon Brown and David Cameron.	A former head of the civil service has said the UK might remain in a "more loosely aligned" European Union, despite the referendum vote to leave.
Emergency services were called to the scene at Main Road, where the A78 Largs to Seamill road was closed to traffic. The woman's 60-year-old husband and the lorry driver, 54, were rescued and taken to hospital with minor injuries. The building is split into five homes and the couple had been watching television in their bottom-floor flat. One other man who was in the building at the time was evacuated unhurt. Another resident Callum Calvey had been out at work when the lorry struck the building at about 13:45. "My bathroom has been wiped out," said the 21-year-old tree surgeon, who lives directly upstairs from the the couple. "There are five flats and none of the other residents are about, but I believe the couple's dog got out as well." Photographer Arlene Foster, who works for Anna Conway Photography, was quickly at the scene from her local shop. "The lorry is literally in someone's front room," she told BBC Scotland. "The lorry seems to have been going towards Ardrossan but hit the building on the opposite side of the road. "Fortunately, it was quite quiet at the time - school kids could have been affected as well if it happened later." Police are urging drivers to stay away from the area, with southbound traffic being diverted at Largs onto the A760 at Hayley Brae and northbound traffic being diverted at the Hunterston Roundabout. The local community had been pressing for a widening of the main road to Hunterston power station and Clyde Port. Steve Graham, chairman of Fairlie Community Council, said: "This was an accident waiting to happen. "There have been a number of near misses, but nothing on this scale. It is a very narrow road with premises adjacent to the road. "We in the community council have been complaining about the weight of traffic coming through the A78, which it's not built for. It would not meet current standards for a trunk road." A Strathclyde Police spokesman added: "The ground floor of the building has been seriously damaged and has been deemed structurally unsound."	A 55-year-old woman has died after a couple became trapped under rubble when a coal lorry ploughed into a house in Fairlie, Ayrshire.
Every evening, at an air base in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, coalition spokesman Saudi Brig-Gen Ahmed al-Assiri delivers an upbeat assessment for the media. The narrative has changed little since the opening days of "Operation Decisive Storm". "We are achieving our aims," says the general. "We are systematically destroying the enemy's bases." But what exactly are those aims and are they being achieved? When the air strikes began on 25 March the war aims of the Saudis and their allies were simple: reverse the takeover of Yemen by rebels and restore the legitimate president, Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi, to power. Neither of those two aims has been achieved. Yet. Mr Hadi is stuck in a guest palace in Saudi Arabia, effectively in exile, while his remaining support base withers away in Yemen. The poorly-armed but determined southerners trying to defend the city of Aden from the Houthi northerners grumble that their president fled the country, leaving them to fend for themselves. The Houthis, who began their takeover of Yemen by overrunning the capital Sanaa in September, have certainly taken a battering from the air strikes. But on the ground they have remained largely in control of the whole of western Yemen where the population is concentrated. Their success is due, not so much to any alleged support from Iran, but to the help they are getting from renegade former President Ali Abdullah Saleh, who has backed them with Republican Guard and other military units still loyal to him. The rebels come from the far north of the country, and as Shia they share the same branch of Islam as only 30 percent of the population; the remainder are Sunnis. So they know they probably cannot hold onto the south indefinitely and will announce a strategic withdrawal once they feel they have made their point, namely that they have survived the onslaught of several air forces and their US-made precision guided missiles. The Saudis have a lot resting on this campaign. The new defence minister, Prince Mohammed bin Salman, is only 34 years old and relatively untested. If the campaign fails it will reflect badly on him but more importantly on his father, King Salman. So the Saudi leadership knows it cannot afford to fail in Yemen, not just for fear of instability spilling across their common border but also for what it means for their own credibility amongst the Saudi people. Periodically there are reports of Saudi armour moving closer to the Yemen border, prompting speculation about a ground offensive. But everyone knows Yemen can be a graveyard for invaders. Its rugged, mountainous terrain and fiercely territorial tribesmen make it an extremely difficult country to fight in. Ask the Egyptians, the British and even latterly the Saudis, who have all taken casualties there. So any ground incursion by the Saudi-led coalition is likely to be a temporary measure - such as, say, throwing a cordon sanitaire around Aden - to secure a better bargaining position when the political negotiations begin in earnest. Iran, whose exact role in Yemen is somewhat murky, has called several times for a ceasefire, accusing their regional rivals, the Saudis, of committing genocide there. On Monday, their foreign minister suggested it was time to choose a new government, with Iranian help. The Saudi reaction was apoplectic. "It's an absolute non-starter," a Saudi adviser told the BBC. "The new Saudi doctrine is to have an Arab world free of any Iranian role. It's typical delusional rhetoric coming out of Tehran." So how exactly will this war end? In fact, can it end? Probably messily is the answer. Three weeks in there are no clear winners or losers, unless you count al-Qaeda which is profiting from the turmoil in the east of the country. Ultimately, there will have to be a political settlement, a compromise deal that is just about acceptable to all parties, otherwise one side or the other will simply carry on fighting. "The Saudis always wanted a political settlement," says a retired Western diplomat. "I can understand why they wanted to do this [campaign] but they need to define victory and that has not been done. Right now the Houthi [rebels] are the ones controlling the narrative." However this ends, Saudi Arabia will be instrumental in Yemen's future. Up until now, it has been one of the country's principal benefactors. Along with other Gulf Arab states, Saudi Arabia has no wish to see Yemen collapse and has poured millions of dollars into the country. If the Houthis were to remain in power it is hard to see that financial tap being turned back on.	For almost three weeks the Saudi-led coalition of mostly Gulf Arab air forces has been pummelling Houthi rebel positions across Yemen.
Healy's tour may be over after he sustained suspected ankle ligament damage against Western Force. Team: London Irish Position: Prop Age: 24 Height: 1.86m Weight: 118kg England caps: 18 "Cian has had an X-ray and, while his left ankle is not broken, he will be assessed further," said Lions coach Warren Gatland. "In the meantime we need to get Alex over here as soon as possible." Healy, 25, twisted his left leg in the 37th minute of the Lions' 69-17 win on Wednesday and had to be taken off on a stretcher in Perth. The Ireland international has also been cited for allegedly biting Western Force scrum-half Brett Sheehan. Corbisiero, 24, was part of the England squad currently in Argentina for the two-Test tour, but has been released immediately to join Gatland's team. The Lions play Queensland Reds in the third match of their tour on Saturday. "We're delighted for Alex," said England head coach Stuart Lancaster. "It's very pleasing for him after he missed the Six Nations through injury and he goes with our full support and blessing." England have no plans to add a replacement to their squad in Argentina. The Red Rose face the Pumas on Saturday (20:10 BST) in the first Test, before the sides meet again in the second Test on 15 June.	England prop Alex Corbisiero has been called up to the British and Irish Lions squad to provide cover for the injured Cian Healy.

Media playback is not supported on this device The hosts won with a day to spare at Old Trafford to level the series. England made 589-8 declared and 173-1 declared to set up their second biggest win over Pakistan in terms of runs. "It's an absolute hammering. It's as good a four days of cricket that you could wish for from an England point of view," Vaughan told Test Match Special. England's Joe Root, promoted to number three for this series, was named man of the match after scoring 254 in the first innings and an unbeaten 71 off 48 balls in the second. He also took four catches in Pakistan's first-innings 198 and claimed a wicket in his only over as Pakistan were bowled out for 234 on Monday. "It's great to see him stepping up to number three and playing with the responsibility there," said captain Alastair Cook, who made 105 and 76 not out. "It's as good an innings as I've seen. He's an extraordinary player. He didn't put a foot wrong; he played beautifully." Root, who twice fell to poor strokes in England's 75-run defeat in the first Test, said: "It's a great feeling. "Those two occasions at Lord's were batsman error on my part. I tried to cut that out of my game. It's the most controlled I've played." Coach Trevor Bayliss said: "He went away and did a bit of soul-searching and hard work, came back and did exactly what he said he was going to do." Vaughan: added: "This was his best Test-match innings." Media playback is not supported on this device Pakistan batted for only 63 overs in the first innings and 70 in the second on a pitch that offered the bowlers little assistance. "Their spirit was broken," said former England batsman Geoffrey Boycott. "Full marks to England - they got it all together, the quality of the batting, the discipline, their good bowling. "England are in a good place and will win again. They will be too strong for Pakistan. I'll be surprised if they come back." Pakistan play a two-day tour game against Worcestershire at New Road starting on Friday before the third Test at Edgbaston gets under way on 3 August. Media playback is not supported on this device Vaughan said: "England should enjoy the win and have a good party, but I just have a feeling that this series is going to be very, very tight." Of the Pakistan players, only captain Misbah-ul-Haq and Asad Shafiq have passed 50 in the first two Tests of the four-match series. "This is a big disappointment for us," said Misbah. "We could have scored around 400 in the first innings - the ball wasn't doing anything much. "We are short of confidence and shot selection really cost us. "These guys are strong characters - mentally strong. I'm hopeful that everybody is hurt and they will really work hard." Media playback is not supported on this device	England produced a flawless performance to beat Pakistan by 330 runs in the second Test, says former captain Michael Vaughan.
The Local Government Information Unit said 94% of the 131 councils it spoke to were intending to put up bills, with their finances at "breaking point". A third of these, 34% in total, intend to hike bills by more than 2% in April. Councils, many of whom have frozen bills in recent years, say it will not be enough to plug the funding "gap" exacerbated by the cost of social care. But the government says council tax is expected to be lower in real terms at the end of this Parliament than it was in 2010. Although councils in Wales were included in the survey, the Welsh government has said it will not allow councils to raise bills to pay for social care. Ministers say they are bringing forward money to help councils pay for social care by increasing the "precept" - a supplement that councils are able to charge on bills - from 2% to 5% over the next two years. Years of cuts to central government funding since 2011 have put pressure on the budgets of the 375 councils in England and Wales, with many paring back core services. Financial pressures on county councils and unitary authorities that provide adult social care have become particularly acute in the past year. Surrey County Council abandoned controversial plans this week to hold a referendum on a 15% rise in council tax which it said was needed to pay for social care. It will now increase bills by 4.99% - the maximum it can do without holding a public vote. Labour have accused the government of doing a sweetheart deal with the Tory-controlled council to call off the referendum - claims it denies. Publishing its research, the Local Government Information Unit said five district councils which do not provide social care had wanted to hold local referendums to sanction council tax rises above 2% but had "thought better" of it in recent weeks. Inflation, as measured by the CPI index, currently stands at 1.6% but is projected to rise to 2.7% next year. The LGIU said there was growing concern in town halls that the current system of funding local authorities - through a mixture of government grants, council tax and other income streams such as business rates and parking charges - would become unsustainable in the near future. Of the 163 council chiefs - across 131 local authorities - which responded to its survey, 42% said future cuts would be "noticed" by residents while one in 10 feared the situation might become so serious that they would no longer be able to fulfil their councils' legal obligations to provide certain services. A number of county councils - including Newcastle, North Tyneside, South Tyneside and Sunderland - have already said they will add the full 3% "social care precept" to council tax bills next year and many others are expected to follow suit. Jonathan Carr-West, chief executive of the LGIU, said: "Local government finances are at breaking point." "We see councils around the country patching their budgets by raising council tax, drawing on their reserves and increasing charging. They have very little confidence in the sustainability of the system. "Councils are allowed to place a 3% precept on council tax to fund adult social care - nine out of 10 of them saying it is not enough money and won't meet the gap. Councils are going to retain 100% of the new business rates - half of councils tell us they think they will be worse off under that new system post-2020." He said councils were being frustrated in their efforts to address the problems themselves with revenue-raising measures such as greater scope for charging, local hotel taxes and a re-evaluation of council tax bands "off the government's agenda". "None of these are wild and wacky ideas. They are things that are done in other countries, in the US, France and Spain and they work. "Here they are not even part of the conversation. That needs to change." A spokesman for the Department of Communities and Local Government said: "Council tax is expected to be lower in real terms at the end of this Parliament than it was in 2010 and we've protected residents by allowing them to veto excessive rises at a local referendum. "Our historic four-year funding settlement gives local authorities the certainty they need to plan ahead, with almost £200bn available to provide the services that local people most value. "We've also announced an additional £900m for social care, meaning councils will have £7.6bn of dedicated funding to spend over the four years."	Scores of local authorities in England plan to increase council tax by up to 5% in 2017-8, according to research.
The Conservatives want a report into the spending on the 218 "procurement cards" used for government spending. A further £475,540 was spent in the first three months of 2015/16. A review was conducted in April 2014, but Welsh ministers said they do not publish the results of internal audits. However, all internal audits are shared with the public spending watchdog, the Wales Audit Office. Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies said: "Unfortunately, the minister [Finance Minister Jane Hutt] is refusing to publish that report, which leaves a number of questions unanswered: is the taxpayer getting value for money?" The Tories say they would encourage public bodies to publish all spending of more than £500. A Welsh government spokesman said: "During the audit process for the Welsh government annual accounts, the Wales Audit Office has the opportunity to review all of the Welsh government's financial transactions. "If Mr Davies is suggesting that civil servants are improperly using procurement cards then he should raise his concerns with the permanent secretary."	More than £3.8m has been spent in the last three years by civil servants using Welsh government-issued credit cards, prompting calls to reveal what the money has been spent on.
In there, they can read books, watch television and play computer games. They have a kettle, a sink, a safe and most have a toilet. The restriction of their liberty is the punishment for their crimes - not their lifestyle inside prison, according to residential officer Kerry Payne. "Prison isn't a place for punishment anymore," she says. "It's for somebody who's done something wrong to give them that time out to change their life because they don't get that stop-gap. "Everything just keeps going till it ends up a bigger and bigger problem." Here, some prisoners describe their life behind bars. James, 27, has been in and out of prison since he was 18 - he's served time in Polmont, Barlinnie and Kilmarnock, as well as Dumfries. Outside, he is a joiner. While he is inside, he is a "hall passman" - responsible for cleaning part of the prison and for which he is paid Â£10 a week. His cell is a cramped space with room for little more than a bed, a sink and a toilet. Prisoners are also provided with a safe with a lock that staff can override during inspections. James's room is decorated with posters; he has a stereo and he pays Â£1 a week for a television. "It's tiny, but it's mine," he says. Jason is just over half way through a 13-month sentence at HMP Dumfries. The 38-year-old has lost count of the number of times he has been locked up since he was remanded for a week when he was 14 years old. "It's become a bit of a revolving door for me," he says. Does prison help him? "No, no. I think you've got to help yourself. Prison doesn't help me, no. "I suppose over all the years, I've started to think a lot more. I'm getting older now so I'm starting to think a lot more about changing or certainly not doing the same things over and over again but that's taken a long time." So will this be his last prison sentence?  "That's my idea, yeah." He is taking art lessons in prison - he enjoys it but he is unlikely to continue his hobby on the outside. "There's a lot of things I need to address first," he says. Does he enjoy being in prison? "No, definitely not." He'd rather have his freedom? "Yeah, absolutely." Ryan, a former police officer, has 12 weeks left to serve of his sentence. He served the first three weeks of his sentence at HMP Addiewell in West Lothian - the local prison for the 29-year-old from Lanarkshire. "I was kept in isolation from the general population just because of the fact that everyone in the prison would have known me because I probably put a few of them in there," he says. He was "terrified" of moving to Dumfries, away from his family, but he says staff "couldn't have been more helpful". During his sentence he has trained as an industrial cleaner. "I really enjoy the cleaning, to be fair. You're always kept busy, there's always something to do. And I take pride in it. I like to make sure the place is clean and it is presentable." He added: "It's funny. I wouldn't say anyone enjoys being in here, that would be sort of masochistic. But I think having something to do, having a purpose, having something to work at does sort of make the days go quicker. "But to the same effect, getting my visits at the weekend, it makes it a lot better."	Prisoners spend up to 15 hours a day locked in their cells at HMP Dumfries.
He spoke at the inauguration of the Palestinian embassy to the Holy See, after meeting Pope Francis. The Vatican recognised Palestinian statehood a year and a half ago. The status of Jerusalem is one of the most sensitive and complex issues of the entire Middle East conflict. Palestinians view East Jerusalem as the capital of their future state but Israel proclaims the entire city as its capital. On Sunday, France is hosting an international conference in Paris to try to kick-start peace talks between the two sides. Can Paris summit save fading two-state solution? Can Jewish settlement issue be resolved? The Pope has repeatedly supported moves to restart the peace process. Relations between the Holy See and Palestinian territories were upgraded in 2015 with the signing of a treaty recognising Palestinian statehood - a move that angered Israel. The Palestinians - and the Israelis - are engaged in a constant search for allies. Official recognition from the Pope is a significant prize. Israel already has an embassy to the Holy See. Now the Palestinian leader, Mahmoud Abbas, has opened the new Palestinian embassy. Pope Francis himself has played a role in the conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians. In 2014, he visited Israel and the Palestinian West Bank. In the Palestinian town of Bethlehem he even stopped to pray in front of Israel's separation barrier. It's a symbol of protection for Israelis - but of occupation for Palestinians. Later that year, the Pope invited the Israeli and Palestinian presidents to come to Rome to pray for peace. Now each side has its own permanent official voice at the Vatican. Israeli relations with the Vatican were further strained after Pope Francis described President Abbas as "an angel of peace" during the canonisation ceremony of two Palestinian nuns at the Vatican in 2015. On Saturday, President Abbas reiterated his concern over President-elect Trump's plan to move the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and said he had written to Mr Trump to warn him of the risks of such a move. "If this is the decision, to transfer the embassy to Jerusalem, it will not help peace and we hope it doesn't happen," President Abbas told reporters outside the Vatican. Palestinian officials say the plan would undermine chances of a negotiated peace based on a two-state solution, in which Palestinian and Israeli states would live side-by-side. "Not only would this move deprive the United States of all legitimacy in playing a role in conflict resolution, it would also destroy the two-state solution," Mr Abbas was quoted earlier as saying in French paper Le Figaro. He also said Palestinians may consider "reversing recognition" of Israel if Mr Trump goes ahead with the move. Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) recognised each other under the 1993 Oslo agreements. Sunday's talks in Paris, involving some 70 countries, are to discuss peace in the region and reiterate support for the two-state solution. French President Francois Hollande has invited President Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to Paris to discuss the outcome of the conference. Mr Netanyahu, who is not planning to attend, said on Thursday: "It's a rigged conference, rigged by the Palestinians with French auspices to adopt additional anti-Israel stances. This pushes peace backwards." Tensions between Israel and the international community were heightened last month after the UN passed a resolution denouncing Israel's settlement activity on occupied land. About 500,000 Jews live in about 140 settlements built since Israel's 1967 occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem. The settlements are considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this.	Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas has warned that peace could suffer if President-elect Donald Trump carries out plans to move the US embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.
The prime minister stressed her belief he was committed to advancing the "special relationship" with the UK. But Mrs May told the Financial Times she expects "very frank" talks on areas where their opinions seem to differ such as the EU and Nato. The PM said she hoped for early progress on a US-UK trade agreement. Mrs May said she believed Mr Trump "recognises the importance and  significance of Nato", despite him being quoted earlier in the week as describing the military alliance as "obsolete". "I'm also confident the USA will recognise the importance of the co-operation we have in Europe to ensure our collective defence and collective security," she told the FT. Mr Trump also said recently he did not really care if the EU separated. Mrs May, who this week outlined for the first time her plan for Brexit, said: "The decision taken by the UK was not a decision about breaking up the EU. "I want the EU to continue to be strong and I want to continue to have a close and strategic partnership with the EU. It is important for security issues. With the threats we face it's not the time for less co-operation." Mr Trump was sworn-in as the 45th US president on Friday. In a statement issued after the inauguration, Mrs May said: "From our conversations to date, I know we are both committed to advancing the special relationship between our two countries and working together for the prosperity and security of people on both sides of the Atlantic. "I look forward to discussing these issues and more when we meet in Washington." In her FT interview, Mrs May said she was "confident we can look at areas even in advance of being able to sign a formal trade deal". But despite Mr Trump's indication he backed a quick post-Brexit trade deal, there was a heavily protectionist tone in the inauguration speech. Some Labour MPs questioned how the prime minister's aim of a free trade deal with the US would be possible given the "America first" strategy outlined by Mr Trump. David Lammy tweeted: "Every decision on trade will be made to benefit Americans. Hmm - looking forward to this trade deal, then." Chris Bryant said: "I'm not sure a UK trade deal with Trump will be very mutually beneficial." However, speaking to the BBC in Myanmar, also known as Burma, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said there was every reason to "be positive and optimistic" about a trade deal. "I think the new president has made it very clear that he wants to put Britain at the front of the line... and obviously that's extremely exciting and important". Earlier Mr Johnson offered his own "warmest congratulations" to Mr Trump. He said the UK would "work hand in glove for the stability, the prosperity and the security of the world". Meanwhile, Thousands of women are expected to join a march in London later as part of an international protest campaign on the first full day of Mr Trump's presidency. Mr Trump has appeared to make good on a pledge to return a bust of Sir Winston Churchill to the White House's Oval Office. The sculpture of the World War Two prime minister's face is said to be a replica of one given to President Lyndon B Johnson in the 1960s and first appeared in the Oval Office during George W Bush's administration in 2001. It was replaced by a bust of civil rights champion Martin Luther King Jr during Barack Obama's presidency. The presence of the Churchill bust was noticed as Mr Trump signed his first orders as president. A report that the bust of Dr King no longer remained in the Oval Office was later found to be discredited.	Theresa May has congratulated Donald Trump on taking office as US president - and says she looks forward to meeting him in Washington.
The Sunday Times says the missile veered off course during a test in June last year - weeks before the Commons voted to spend £40bn renewing Trident. Questioned by Andrew Marr, the PM refused to say four times if she had known about the test ahead of the vote. The SNP's Nicola Sturgeon called for a "full disclosure" of what happened. According to the Sunday Times, an unarmed Trident II D5 missile veered off in the wrong direction towards the US - instead of towards Africa - when it was launched from a British submarine off the coast of Florida. In July - days after Mrs May had become prime minister - MPs voted overwhelmingly in favour of replacing Trident. During the debate, Mrs May told MPs it would be "an act of gross irresponsibility" for the UK to abandon its nuclear weapons. MPs backed its renewal by 472 votes to 117. However, all 52 SNP MPs voted against it - as did Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. When asked on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show whether she had known then that a misfire had happened, Mrs May said: "I have absolute faith in our Trident missiles. "When I made that speech in the House of Commons, what we were talking about was whether or not we should renew our Trident." She was asked a further three times - but did not answer the questions. The Ministry of Defence did not give details of the test process but said it had been a success. Scottish First Minister, Mrs Sturgeon - a long-standing opponent of Trident, whose submarines are based at Faslane, on the River Clyde - said the apparent misfire was a "hugely serious issue". She tweeted: "There should be full disclosure of what happened, who knew what/when, and why the House of Commons wasn't told." Meanwhile, Mr Corbyn said the reports called for "a serious discussion". He told Sky News: "It's a pretty catastrophic error when a missile goes in the wrong direction, and while it wasn't armed, goodness knows what the consequences of that could have been." Nia Griffith, the shadow defence secretary, said it was "completely unacceptable" that Mrs May had "side-stepped" questions. She called for the prime minister to give "a full explanation" to Parliament on Monday. Admiral Lord West, the Labour peer and ex-Royal Navy officer, said it was "bizarre and stupid" to not tell anyone about the test. The Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) described reports of a misfire as a "very serious failure". "There's absolutely no doubt that this would have impacted on the debate in Parliament on Trident replacement," its general secretary Kate Hudson said. A statement issued by both Downing Street and the MoD said the capability and effectiveness of Trident was "unquestionable". "In June the Royal Navy conducted a routine, unarmed Trident missile test launch from HMS Vengeance, as part of an operation which is designed to certify the submarine and its crew. "Vengeance and her crew were successfully tested and certified, allowing Vengeance to return into service. We have absolute confidence in our independent nuclear deterrent." The Sunday Times says the test fire was launched from HMS Vengeance. It says the Trident II D5 missile was intended to be fired 5,600 miles (9,012 km) to a sea target off the west coast of Africa but veered towards the US. The cause remains top secret, the paper says, but it quotes a senior naval source as saying the missile suffered an in-flight malfunction after launching out of the water. HMS Vengeance, one of the UK's four Vanguard-class submarines, returned to sea for trials in December 2015 after a £350m refit, which included the installation of new missile launch equipment and upgraded computer systems. According to the Sunday Times, it is expected that Defence Secretary Michael Fallon will be called to the Commons to answer questions from MPs. BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Beale said while the MoD has described the test as a success for the crew and the boat, it has not denied the report that the missile itself might have veered off course. In the past the MoD has issued a press release and video of successful tests but its silence on this occasion has raised questions as to whether any fault was deliberately kept quiet ahead of the key vote, our correspondent added. The Trident system was acquired by the Thatcher government in the early 1980s as a replacement for the Polaris missile system, which the UK had possessed since the 1960s. Trident came into use in the 1990s. There are three parts to it - submarines, missiles and warheads. Although each component has years of use left, they cannot last indefinitely. The current generation of four submarines would begin to end their working lives some time in the late 2020s. A guide to the Trident debate	Theresa May is coming under pressure to say whether she knew about a reported misfire of the UK's nuclear weapons system before a crucial Commons vote.
The angry response came after secretary of state nominee Rex Tillerson said the US should deny Beijing access to new islands in the South China Sea. Two state-run papers carry editorials strongly criticising his comments. The hawkish Global Times tabloid warned that any such action would lead to "a large-scale war". Beijing has been building artificial islands on reefs in waters also claimed by other nations. Images published late last year show military defences on some islands, a think-tank says. Speaking at his confirmation hearing on Wednesday, Mr Tillerson likened China's island-building to Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. "We're going to have to send China a clear signal that first, the island-building stops and second, your access to those islands also is not going to be allowed." China's official response, from foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang, was muted. China had the right to conduct "normal activities" in its own territory, he said. Asked specifically about the remark on blocking access, he said he would not respond to hypothetical questions. But editorials in the China Daily and the Global Times were more direct in their comments. The China Daily suggested Mr Tillerson's remarks showed ignorance of Sino-US relations and diplomacy in general. "Such remarks are not worth taking seriously because they are a mish-mash of naivety, shortsightedness, worn-out prejudices and unrealistic political fantasies," it said. "Should he act on them in the real world, it would be disastrous. "As many have observed, it would set a course for devastating confrontation between China and the US. After all, how can the US deny China access to its own territories without inviting the latter's legitimate, defensive responses?" The Global Times, a nationalist daily, suggested that Mr Tillerson's "astonishing" comments came because "he merely wanted to curry favour from senators and increase his chances of being confirmed by intentionally showing a tough stance toward China". China would ensure his "rabble rousing" would not succeed, it went on. "Unless Washington plans to wage a large-scale war in the South China Sea, any other approaches to prevent Chinese access to the islands will be foolish." The Obama administration has spoken out strongly against the island-building, pledged to ensure freedom of navigation in the South China Sea and sending navy ships to sail in contested areas. But it has not threatened to block access to the islands, a step likely to enrage Beijing. Mr Tillerson did not explain how the US might block access to the islands, and both Chinese papers suggested a wait-and-see policy. "It remains to be seen to what extent his views against China will translate into US foreign policies," the China Daily said.	Blocking China from islands it has built in contested waters would lead to "devastating confrontation", Chinese state media have warned.

A recent programme in Algeria earned fierce criticism for fooling a renowned communist novelist into believing he had been arrested for "atheism and espionage". During the segment, 75-year-old Rachid Boudjedra was forced by fake police officers to repeat the Islamic proclamation "God is Greatest" and utter the two Islamic testimonies of faith. The programme, called We Got You was later suspended amid a wave of criticism from civil society. TV has become an important part of the Islamic holy month, and broadcasters will often commission special programmes to draw audiences in as they break their fast in the evening. Prank TV shows have risen in popularity, but have also earned criticism in recent years for taking things too far. Egyptian actor Ramez Galal has established himself as a major TV prankster, with a series of programmes featuring celebrities in increasingly extreme scenarios. In one edition, he fooled celebrities into believing they were on a sinking ship, surrounded by floating body parts and an approaching shark. In another, victims were locked inside a supposed ancient Egyptian tomb containing bats, insects and a mummy rising from the dead. In 2013 during a programme entitled Ramez, the Fox of the Desert, guest celebrities were fooled into believing the bus they were travelling on had been intercepted by militants. The mock militants pretended to shoot the driver dead and then blindfolded and handcuffed the guests. This was aired at a time when Egypt was witnessing a surge in terror attacks, particularly in the region of Sinai, where military convoys were often attacked by armed bandits in desolate areas. Galal revels in the controversy. In a trailer for his show, he admits to "torturing his friends and fellow actors because he loves them". And it may be that only the audience is being fooled. Sharp-eyed viewers often find clues signalling that the guests are in on the prank. Some celebrities have confirmed that this was the case. Tunisia's The Earthquake is another controversial programme which fools guests into believing they are experiencing a violent tremor. In one episode, an elderly religious leader insisted on continuing to pray despite the ongoing quake. The show was widely criticised on social media for disregarding the age and health conditions of the guests, who seemed genuinely scared. Similar charges were levelled at Algeria's We Got You. Following the episode featuring Mr Boudjedra, one Algerian novelist said it was "unbelievable that a famous writer was ridiculously pranked with no regards to his age or fame". Religious bodies in the region have recently issued fatwas (religious edicts) asserting that terrorising people for any purpose is religiously forbidden. The shows are also criticised, like the slew of entertainment programmes aired during Ramadan, for being a distraction from spiritual dedication during the holy month. Egyptian media expert Yasser Abd-al-Aziz told the BBC that the prevalence of TV pranks has forced production companies to push the boundaries of good taste in order to attract audience and advertising revenue. But one popular show entitled The Shock appears to buck this trend, with more traditional pranks, rather than terrifying ordeals. The show is filmed in a number of Arab countries, capturing reactions to staged situations such as a man violently scolding his wife, a student insulting his teacher or a child standing helpless in the cold weather asking passers-by for a coat. It has won over audiences across the the region by exploring how strangers interact in dramatic but everyday situations. As Twitter user @Nooruldeen89 put it: "Despite the acts being staged, The Shock awakens the human in you and makes you rethink your perspective." BBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world. You can follow BBC Monitoring on Twitter and Facebook.	From shipwrecks to terror attacks to an air disaster involving Paris Hilton, it seems that almost nothing is off-limits for the prank shows that have become a staple of North African TV during the Islamic fasting month of Ramadan.
The opposition Socialists struck a deal with two smaller far-left parties over the weekend, all but guaranteeing Prime Minister Pedro Passos Coelho will fall. Mr Passos Coelho's party emerged as the largest in October's election, but has no absolute majority. Government bond yields hit a five-month high, while shares fell 1.9%. "The scenario of a left-wing government and the ousting of the centre-right is about to become reality, which the markets obviously don't like," said Joao Lampreia, an analyst at Banco BiG. Portugal's benchmark 10-year bond yields jumped over 20 basis points to 2.87%, the highest since July, as investors anticipated higher borrowing costs. Socialist Party leader Antonio Costa sealed the so-called "Triple Left" pact with the Communist Party and Left Bloc over the weekend. Together they will have 122 seats, enough to out-vote the centre-right coalition government, which was left with only 107 after October's inconclusive elections. A vote on the government's programme is likely to take place on Tuesday, when the leftist parties are set to use their parliamentary advantage to topple the minority administration. Matt Cairns, a strategist at Rabobank, said there were fears a change in government "could end up in some wind-back of austerity measures". Another analyst, Rainer Guntermann at Commerzbank, warned "rating jitters are also on the rise for Portugal". Amid the political uncertainty, Portugal's only investment grade credit rating will be assessed on Friday by credit agency DBRS. The loss of that rating would bar Portugal from the European Central Bank's quantitative easing (QE) programme, Commerzbank warns.	Portuguese bonds and stocks were hit on Monday as a coalition of left-of-centre anti-austerity parties looked set to form the country's next government.
Peterborough restaurant owner Mohammed Khubaib, 43, was convicted of rape and grooming offences last month. During his trial at the Old Bailey, the jury was told he forced a 14-year-old girl to perform a sex act on him after getting her drunk. He had a "persistent and almost predatory interest" in girls, the court heard. Det Supt Gary Ridgway from Cambridgeshire Police said the sentence showed "just how serious this type of offence is". "This represents justice for young people who had the courage to stand up in court and relive some very difficult experiences," he said. Khubaib was the tenth person to be convicted under Operation Erle, which focussed on allegations of sex abuse by other groups of men and boys against young girls. Four previous cases led to nine male defendants being jailed for 59 offences against 15 girls from Peterborough and elsewhere in the East Midlands. "We are pleased with this sentence today as it represents justice for the girls and young women who suffered at the hands of this vicious criminal," said Wendi Ogle-Welbourn, from Peterborough City Council. She praised the "bravery" of the victims who had given evidence during the course of the trial. "Their courage in reliving some absolutely horrendous experiences at the hands of this criminal has enabled us to get the result we did today and means that other girls and young women are safer in our city," she said. Cambridgeshire's Police and Crime Commissioner Sir Graham Bright described Khubaib's actions as "crime of the worst kind".	A businessman who plied teenage girls with vodka before sexually abusing them has been sentenced to 13 years.
Both sides had chances before the Pars' Ryan Wallace drilled a low shot into the bottom corner with 15 minutes left. The lead last just two minutes as Ross Davidson got the last touch on a free-kick into the area. The home side dominated the closing stages but could could not deny Rovers, who remain in fifth place. Rovers remain level with Airdrieonians, who drew at home with Forfar Athletic.	Scottish League One leaders Dunfermline Athletic were held at home by Albion Rovers but still moved 11 points clear at the top of the table.
He has written to the parliamentary speaker criticising her for passing it in December without a quorum. Homosexuals were "abnormal" or were so for "mercenary reasons" and could be "rescued", a local paper quotes his letter as saying. The bill provides for life imprisonment for homosexual acts and also makes it a crime not to report gay people. The promotion of homosexuality - even talking about it without condemning the lifestyle - would also be punishable by a prison term. The BBC's Catherine Byaruhanga in the capital, Kampala, says the president is aware that if he signs the bill there will be an international outcry, which could see some countries suspend aid to the country. His spokesman told the AFP news agency that Mr Museveni believes that gay people are sick but this does not mean they should be killed or jailed for life. "What the president has being saying is that we shall not persecute these  homosexuals and lesbians. That is the point," said Tamale Mirudi. By Catherine ByaruhangaBBC, Uganda Uganda already has legislation banning gay sex, specifically between men, lesbianism wasn't considered under a provision of the 1950 Penal Code. The new law would add female-to-female sex to banned practices. The Penal Code also never made it an offence for someone to identify himself or herself as a homosexual. It was the act that was illegal. Gay activists have been able to state their sexuality in public and advocate for their rights without being prosecuted. This, legislators felt, endangered Uganda's culture and family structure, centred around marriage between a man and woman. There's been a battle here, well captured in the international media, between gay activists and Evangelical Christians over the rights and wrongs of homosexuality. So what MPs are trying to do is to create the "idea" of homosexuality in the law. Once you specify that homosexuality is wrong, you then ban its promotion. If the law is passed, standing up saying "I am gay" would become illegal. Citizens would also have to report anyone who they believe is gay to the police. And it would be illegal to provide advisory services to homosexuals. He denied that the president had changed his mind under pressure. "The president's position has been the same for a long time, nothing has changed,"  he added. Our reporter says Mr Museveni is trying to reach a compromise with MPs, because if he refuses to sign the bill, parliament can still force it through with a two-thirds vote. But in contrast to Nigeria, where earlier this month the president signed a bill banning same-sex marriages, gay groups and shows of same-sex public affection, Mr Museveni is politically strong and so more able to resist pressure from conservative groups, she says. Mr Museveni said the bill was forced through despite his advice to shelve it until the government had studied it in depth, Uganda's private Monitor newspaper reports. "Even with legislation, they will simply go underground and continue practicing [sic] homosexuality or lesbianism for mercenary reasons," he is quoted as saying. The president's eight-page letter to speaker Rebecca Kadaga said they could be "rescued" by improving the economy. He also disputed the view that homosexuality could be described as an "alternative sexual orientation". "You cannot call an abnormality an alternative orientation. It could be that the Western societies, on account of random breeding, have generated many abnormal people," he said. He said another reason women became lesbians was because of "sexual starvation" when they failed to marry, the Monitor reports. Ugandan gay rights activist Pepe Julian Onziema told the BBC's Focus on Africa programme he had mixed feelings about Mr Museveni's comments. "Him not assenting to the bill makes us happy but him calling us 'abnormal', 'nothing-doers', 'sexually starved', that is so derogatory," he said. "It encourages the community to attack people like me." There is meant to be a caucus meeting of ruling party MPs later this month to discuss the bill. The government will try to persuade them to reject it, but some have already said they would go against their government's wishes, our correspondent says. Human rights activists say the bill highlights the intolerance and discrimination the gay community faces in Uganda. One gay activist was killed in 2011, although the police denied he was targeted because of his sexuality. The bill has been condemned by world leaders since it was mooted in 2009 - US President Barack Obama called it "odious". The private member's bill originally proposed the death penalty for some offences, such as if a minor was involved or the perpetrator was HIV-positive, but this clause has been dropped. Correction 19 January: An earlier version of this story referred to Pepe Julian Onziema as a woman. The BBC is sorry for any offence caused.	Uganda's President Yoweri Museveni has refused to approve a controversial bill to toughen punishments for homosexuals.
The world number two is 18 years, four months and 20 days old. The previous record was held by American Morgan Pressel, who was 18 years, 10 months and nine days old when she won the Kraft Nabisco in 2007. Ko shot eight birdies in a final round of 63 to finish on 16 under par, with American Lexi Thompson on 10 under. In February, aged 17, Ko became the youngest player to reach the top of the rankings and she also holds the record as the youngest winner on the LPGA Tour after her Canadian Open victory as a 15-year-old amateur in 2012. It was Ko's last opportunity to beat the age record as she would have been too old by the next major, the ANA Inspiration, in April. "It has been such an unbelievable experience," Ko told Sky Sports. "Now everybody won't ask me when I will win my first major because it is done. "It is definitely one of the top rounds of my whole life." Ko had started the day in third place, two shots behind overnight leader Lee Mi-hyang of South Korea. Tournament organisers decide to use split tees, using the first and the 10th, due to the threat of thunderstorms on Sunday afternoon. Lee's challenge faded and she finished tied for fourth place, nine shots behind Ko, after carding a three over par 74. England's Charley Hull was six over for the day and finished tied for 38th place, while Republic of Ireland amateur Leona Maguire was tied for 34th.	New Zealand's Lydia Ko has become the youngest winner of a major with a six-stroke victory at the Evian Championship in France on Sunday.
Spain's Marta Corredera curled the hosts into an early lead before England striker Dan Carter doubled their lead moments later. Alex Scott made it 3-0 straight after half-time, before Kirsty Linnett pulled one back for the visitors. Three-times winners Arsenal will now face Notts County Ladies in the final at Rotherham on 1 November. In a repeat of the 2011 and 2012 finals, Arsenal made an energetic start and Carter struck the crossbar before Corredera's sweet strike from the edge of the area opened the scoring. Carter than raced clear, one-on-one with Sophie Baggeley, and calmly lobbed over the Birmingham goalkeeper. The Blues responded well to falling two-goals behind but Karen Carney's deflected shot was turned on to a post by Sari Van Veenendaal, and bounced back across the face of goal and clear. After the break, Arsenal made the win safe with Scott's powerful finish, before Linnett's well-struck consolation. In a bad-tempered second half, Carter drilled wide after a superb knock-down from Jordan Nobbs late on, but a two-goal cushion was sufficient to see Arsenal through. Arsenal manager Pedro Martinez Losa told BBC Sport: "We have been starting games well. I'm very happy with that. "The best feeling today is to offer the fans victories in the last three home games of the season. I'm proud of the players, the staff and the team. "This is the reward for everybody's efforts. We have to do everything possible between now and the final to prepare." Birmingham manager David Parker told BBC Sport: "Arsenal were the better side in the first half, that's won them the game. "Defensive errors and mistakes in that first 20 minutes were the difference. "Looking at the second half display, for long, long periods we were the better side and we really showed our quality."

It will be the first time that the tournament has been held in England since 1993, when the home side beat New Zealand in the final at Lord's. The tournament, which starts on 26 June next year, consists of 31 matches, with Lord's hosting the final on 23 July. It will feature eight teams and will be played in a round-robin format. Steve Elworthy, the ECB's director of events, said the tournament will help "drive interest and participation in women's cricket at every level". He added: "It's critical we use this event to reach out to young children in particular, so we've moved the tournament start date to earlier in the summer, a decision which will help our host venues encourage attendance by engaging with schools in the build-up to the event."	Derbyshire, Leicestershire, Somerset, Gloucestershire and Lord's have been named as venues for the ICC Women's World Cup in 2017.
The Niagara County Legislature voted in favour of asking New York's attorney general to investigate on Thursday. The local water authority said the colour was caused by residue from black carbon filters used to clean the water. The water authority says July's treatment process was necessary and the discharge within "permitted limits". An inky and foul-smelling cloud of water appeared at the base of Niagara Falls on 29 July 2017. Some initially suspected an oil spill, but the Niagara Falls Water Board (NFWB) said it was caused by a "routine" water treatment and apologised for causing alarm to residents and tourists. In a statement the board said the "inky water" was the result of a "necessary and short term change in the waste water treatment process" at its plant near the city of Buffalo. Officials say the plant had the correct paperwork to release the discharge - which came from one of its five sediment filtration basins and was being flushed out over the weekend in preparation for contractors to begin upgrade work.	The discharge of black smelly wastewater at the base of Niagara Falls has prompted calls for a criminal inquiry.
Felix Alexander, from Worcester, was 17 when he was hit by a train on 27 April last year. His mother Lucy Alexander has set up The Felix Project, launched at Pershore High School on Monday. The programme aims to help teachers spot the signs of a child being victimised and to train pupils to give peer support. See more stories from across Herefordshire and Worcestershire here It is being run by the children's charity Place2Be. Ms Alexander said: "I carry huge guilt that I did not say more when he was still alive and I feel compelled to give him a voice now." Advice she gave out to the Pershore pupils included some words on banter, saying it is only funny if people are secure in their friendships. Pershore High head teacher Clive Corbett backed the scheme, which Ms Alexander hopes will become embedded in the school curriculum. "We will train pupils to be what we call a peer mentor, and also staff from this school and other schools to make sure we are providing training for them," he said. "However well we feel we might do, we clearly can do things better." Speaking after the event, a couple of the pupils said Ms Alexander was "inspirational". She previously said her son was subjected to "cruel and overwhelming" taunts on social media, which eventually became unbearable. An inquest heard he made friends at Pershore High School, where the staff described him as bright and kind, after facing difficulties at his previous school.	The mother of a teenager who took his own life because of online bullying has set up a programme to tackle the issue.
"OK, folks, good morning and welcome, what have we got from the weekend?" On the 23rd floor of the Metropolitan Police's west London office, Detective Chief Superintendent Alaric Bonthron begins a morning briefing for one of the force's most secretive sections. Known as a "grip and pace" meeting, it's a regular catch-up for senior officers from the Department of Professional Standards, the 380-strong unit responsible for dealing with complaints against officers and staff, deaths in custody, police misconduct - and corruption. "We had a CAD (computer-aided dispatch) message from an anonymous female alleging that police were involved with the supply of drugs," says one of the dozen senior officers sitting around the table, in a room with panoramic views over London. Another policeman chips in with details of a separate allegation. "One officer... tried to persuade another officer to amend their notes whilst they were with a prisoner in a hospital, I understand," he says. Det Ch Supt Bonthron checks that the information is being dealt with appropriately and moves on down a list which also includes the latest court cases and misconduct hearings. These are busy times for the department, spread over four floors and with a budget of £24 million. Over the past two months it's carried out investigations into a Met policeman over allegations of voyeurism and inciting prostitution; a Heathrow community support officer who admitted stealing a wallet containing almost £2,500; and a police recruit, who's accused of publishing extreme pornography. This was also the unit which investigated the so-called "plebgate" affair, which led to one officer being jailed - and sacked, along with three others. Bonthron says he's sometimes shocked by what his colleagues have got up to. "There are things that make you look up and think 'has somebody actually really done that?'," he says, adding that "99.9 percent" do a good job when they come to work. "Unfortunately, we have a few people who either make mistakes or do stupid things and the rest of the organisation doesn't want those people in the job." The corruption arm of the unit has its origins in a drive against so-called "bent cops" initiated in the early 1990s by the then Met Commissioner Sir Paul - now Lord - Condon, who famously told the Home Affairs Committee that he had "a minority of officers who are corrupt, dishonest, unethical".  He suggested they numbered around 250. Investigations conducted by the shadowy Scotland Yard unit that became known as CIB3 found that officers were passing information to criminals - and journalists - in return for money; there were cases where evidence had been sabotaged; and police, it was discovered, had been complicit with informants in plotting crimes in order to share the spoils. In 2000, Neil Basu, who now heads Scotland Yard's organised crime and gangs command, was recruited into the unit that was once known as the "ghost squad" because it was so secretive. "We felt kind of excommunicated from the Met," he reveals. "I sort of joke about it now, but I can't remember being invited to a leaving do for the three years I was on professional standards." Basu, who was then a "green" detective inspector, says he was "wide-eyed" at the extent of corruption he came across. "My God, none of us realised it was at this level. What we were looking at here was people who were drug-dealers, conspiracy to commit kidnap, conspiracy to commit violence, serious assaults, perhaps even attempted murder". Investigating corrupt officers was even more challenging for Basu and his colleagues because the suspects were aware of police tactics, including surveillance. "Imagine how difficult it is to follow somebody who knows what cars the police use, who knows what techniques they use, who know exactly where to go, what to look for, where to park, how to conduct themselves in a busy environment," he says. It may be one of the reasons why cases in which police corruption is alleged to have played a part, such as the murder of the private investigator Daniel Morgan in 1987, can be so hard to solve. And it may explain why the Department of Professional Standards, though no longer a "ghost squad", is still sealed off from the rest of the Metropolitan Police. "We are a force within a force", says Alaric Bonthron. "Everything I could do if I was out on a borough... we can do exactly the same". The unit has its own intelligence hub and dedicated surveillance teams, so if it needs to move in on an officer or member of staff within the force no one else will find out. "The people who know are the people who need to know," says Det Ch Supt Bonthron. "The commissioner gets briefed on the high level jobs... but again you've got to be careful who you include in a lot of these jobs." The process of preventing corruption begins at the recruitment stage, when new joiners are vetted, drug tested and warned about the dangers of dodgy friendships and inappropriate social media postings that could leave them vulnerable. Fiona Taylor, a deputy assistant commissioner who's in overall charge of professional standards, says it's a "robust" process - but she acknowledges the need for continual vigilance as policemen and women forge their careers. "Policing is a very, very complicated job in the 21st century - we need to understand that if somebody makes a mistake and we can rehabilitate them, we can develop them, we can bring them back into the organisation, then we will do that,".  she explains. She adds that most officers go about their business "very bravely and very professionally". The number of dismissals for misconduct issues in the Met is fairly stable - 48 in 2013/14 and 64 the previous year. But the former Strathclyde Police assistant chief constable, who joined the Met in 2013, has a tough side too, as she makes clear she's not "in the business" of keeping corrupt or bad officers within the organisation. "We need to have the capacity to catch... potentially serious criminals who exist within our midst -- and you know we do that!"

Thomas Farr, 31, died from multiple injuries after he was hit by a car on the A22 Caterham bypass, at about 23:00 GMT on 26 March. Police said his death may be linked to an "altercation" at a flat in Croydon Road, when another man was stabbed. An inquest into Mr Farr's death has been opened and adjourned.	A pedestrian who was killed in a collision that police believe may be linked to an earlier disturbance at a flat in Surrey has been identified.
Lancashire, Manchester and North Merseyside Wildlife Trust said the skins of insects have been found on Winmarleigh Moss, near Garstang. The baculovirus drives caterpillars on a "death march" to the top of plants, then when it dies the bug bursts out to seek other victims. The trust's Dr Chris Miller said it was "gruesome - like a zombie horror film". Dr Miller was carrying out a butterfly survey on Winmarleigh Moss when he noticed a caterpillar hanging from the end of a branch of a small bush. He then saw another one hanging from a tall blade of grass. "Both were dead but otherwise intact," he said. Dr Miller also noticed "small scraps of caterpillar skin" on other branches he checked. He said research is showing that the baculovirus affects the way the "zombie" insects respond to light, "making them climb to higher and more dangerous places and when they get there they die". "It is really unusual seeing caterpillars high up as they can be eaten by birds. "This is a caterpillar of the oak eggar moth which eats heather and bilberry so it is normally hidden in the undergrowth, not at the top of plants." Source: Lancashire, Manchester and North Merseyside Wildlife Trust	Caterpillars are being killed by a bug which turns them into "exploding zombies", a wildlife expert has said.
Whilst on patrol over Winnipeg, the chopper's crew accidentally turned on its loudspeaker allowing members of the public below to hear them. Those listening say they heard pilots swearing and discussing oral sex. Winnipeg Police Service say some of the "conversation was inappropriate" and have promised an internal review. Brandi Armstrong told CBC news that she had been sitting in her garden on Monday evening as the helicopter flew over and was shocked by the exchange. "My jaw hit the ground; eyes bulged out," she said. She added that she would like to see the pilots punished. The police say that they are considering disciplinary measures. Another resident walking near the city's legislature building overhead a different, expletive-laden discussion about money. The officers were unaware that the loudspeaker was on due to the noise from the helicopter's engine. Residents listening below began to tweet to the city's police department as the pilots continued talking.	Canadian police have apologised after an explicit conversation was inadvertently broadcast from one of its helicopters.
The John Deere tractor was pulled over by officers in the village of Ripley and had two other males on board. The vehicle had been seen in nearby Harrogate at about 05:00 GMT with no headlights on. Police said the driver had no licence, was not insured and did not have permission from the tractor's owner. The vehicle was seized, with the three due to be interviewed by officers. Posting on Twitter, Insp Chris Galley said: "A strange end to a night shift. 15-year-old lad driving a tractor as a taxi for his drunk mates."	A tractor being driven by a 15-year-old boy "as a taxi for his drunk mates" has been stopped by police in North Yorkshire.
Frank MacDonald, 44, from the Brechin area, was between the B976 South Deeside Road at Strachan and the B974 Cairn o'Mount road at about 14:00 on Saturday when the crash happened. The vehicles involved were a blue Suzuki GSXR motorcycle and a grey Toyota Hilux. Relatives said the "much loved" father-of-three would be greatly missed. The unclassified road was closed for more than eight hours following the crash. Police have appealed for witnesses to come forward.	A man who died after his motorbike collided with a car in Aberdeenshire has been named.
Attention is focusing on how Khalid Masood was able to enter the Carriage Gates entrance of Parliament before he was confronted and subsequently shot. One security expert said the breach may have been a product of complacency. Ministers insist the police did their job and Parliament can't be sealed off - and a security review is under way. A Parliamentary spokesman said security was always under "constant review" but the building had to remain "open and accessible" for it to function. The review follows the fatal stabbing of PC Keith Palmer in the grounds of the Palace of Westminster. Ministers have declined to comment on unconfirmed reports that his alleged assailant was shot dead by a member of Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon's close protection team, who happened to be at the scene, rather than a uniformed officer stationed at the gate. Some MPs regard the carriage gates entrance, which is used by government cars to drop off and pick up ministers, as a weak point in the security perimeter. It is manned by two police officers but they are not always armed and the gate is often open, unlike other entrances to the Palace of Westminster. The Times reported that a 2005 review had found the entrance to be a weak point, primarily due to the number of delivery vans using it. The paper quoted parliamentary sources as saying any changes at the time had been regarded as "too cumbersome". The Met Police said the current security arrangements had been in place for many years and were "designed to provide access to the seat of our government balanced carefully with security that is proportionate but not overly intrusive". "Of course, after an incident like this, as would be expected, my team will work with parliamentary authorities to assess whether a different tone or a different balance is necessary," Assistant Deputy Commissioner Mark Rowley said on Friday. Parliament, which oversees its own security, said the arrangements should reflect the level of risk it faced. "As is good practice following any significant incident, the Houses in conjunction with the police and other bodies will also be carrying out a review of security around this specific incident," a spokesman said. Former Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers has said there is now a case for all police officers guarding Parliament and other "sensitive sites" to be routinely armed. There are two Metropolitan Police officers manning Carriage Gates at all times. Behind the gates there is a hut staffed by a third officer, whose job is to monitor pedestrians exiting the estate. All three officers are issued with stab vests. They check to ensure the driver of a vehicle or bicycle has the correct parliamentary pass. Cars are security vetted beyond the gates. They all have two way radios so can call for help in emergencies. Armed police are on patrol throughout the Parliamentary estate at all times but they are more visible at times of heightened security. Security expert Professor Anthony Glees said the attack had demonstrated a "lack of protection" within Parliament. "I am very disturbed by the complacent attitude," Prof Glees, who heads the Centre for Security and Intelligence Studies programme at the University of Buckingham told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme. "The fact is in immediate terms and wider terms, this was a failure of security policy. "This is someone who got within 100 metres of where the prime minister was. If he had an explosive vest, we would be having a very different conversation." Tony Long, a former armed police officer, said those stationed at College Gates were effectively "meeters and greeters and pass checkers" who were well known to MPs. He told Victoria Derbyshire there had been a huge reluctance within Parliament, which oversees its own security, to have armed officers on patrol. "There is a huge amount of tradition about that building," he said. "I guarantee if those gates were shut, the first person to complain about it would be an MP or a cabinet minister." Several MPs have warned Westminster should not be turned into a fortress. "The idea that arming all police will be a panacea and a solution to this problem may well be mistaken," said Conservative MP Dominic Grieve. "It is worth bearing in mind that in fact security wasn't breached. There was a tragic loss of life but in trying to breach security, he was stopped." Kim Howells, a former chair of the Intelligence and Security Committee, said one must remember Parliament is a "working building with people moving in and out". Asked why Masood had not been stopped from entering the parliamentary estate, he said: "This guy ran in through the gates. As a former rugby man, I know it is not easy to bring down a man in such a situation." There was a major review of security at the Palace of Westminster in 2014 which was supposed to "assess the strengths and weaknesses of the current arrangements and to make recommendations". Its findings have not been published.	Questions continue to be asked about whether Wednesday's fatal terror attack in Parliament could have been prevented if more officers had been armed.
Loren Davis was driving at 100km/h (62mph) on an expressway in Adelaide on Tuesday when she hit the koala as it was crossing the road. Ms Davis only discovered what had happened to the animal when she reached home and inspected her car. The koala only had minor abrasions and will be released into the wild soon. "We're calling him Bear Grylls," said Ms Davis, whose choice of nickname was inspired by the British survival expert and television presenter. Koalas, which are often mistaken for bears, are in fact marsupials. Ms Davis told reporters that she had been driving down a dark stretch on the expressway and only saw the koala when her headlights illuminated it. She said she could not change lanes nor brake because of traffic next to her and behind her, and had "no choice but to hit the koala". She later pulled to one side to check but could not see the koala anywhere. Ms Davis drove to her home about 10km away, "feeling upset that I'd killed a koala," she told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). "Once I got home and pulled into the garage I turned on the light to see the damage. I turned around, saw a koala and just screamed." The koala was still conscious and growled as Ms Davis approached. She and her fiance finally pushed a blanket underneath its dangling arm so that it could push itself up and out of the grill. Animal rescue volunteers later came by and took the animal for treatment. It is expected to be released soon. Fauna Rescue co-ordinator Merridy Montarello told The Advertiser newspaper in Adelaide that it was a "very, very lucky koala". "It's because of the particular size of it [that it survived]... It's just sat itself inside the car." "Bear Grylls" is not the only koala to have a lucky escape on Australia's roads. Another koala got stuck head-first in a car grill three weeks ago when it was hit on a road in another part of Adelaide, reported ABC.  In 2011, a koala named Kenny in Queensland also survived under similar circumstances. In 2014 a koala named Timberwolf survived a 54.5 mile (88km) ride clinging to the bottom of a car, also in Queensland. However, not all koalas are so lucky - according to some estimates, about 85% of koalas involved in road accidents may die from their injuries.	A koala in Australia has been dubbed "Bear Grylls" after it was hit by a fast-moving car and survived when it got wedged in the car's front grill.
It was the famous Fairfield yard which took the Upper Clyde to great heights and worldwide prominence. The yard was founded in 1864 by William Elder, a talented marine engineer who developed the compound engine which transformed shipbuilding by allowing vessels to use fuel more efficiently and travel further. Under William Pearce from 1888, the company flourished, building luxurious ocean liners, steamers and naval ships for the world. At its peak before World War 1, the Fairfield shipyard was part of a local industry which directly employed 70,000 workers in 19 yards. The largest crane in the world, with a maximum lift capacity of 250 tons, was built at the Govan yard in 1911 and in the following year Fairfield had 12 ships under construction at the same time. The inter-war years saw a gradual decline but Clydeside's largest shipyard still built many famous ships and during wartime it was a major builder for the Royal Navy. But after World War 2, the decline set in swiftly and despite a major modernisation programme in the 1950s the yards of the Clyde were unable to compete with new shipbuilding superpowers such as Japan. By 1967 the receivers were called in and it looked as if the end had come for Fairfield and for shipbuilding in Govan. Sean Connery, at the height of his James Bond fame, made a documentary about problems besetting the yard, entitled The Bowler and the Bunnet. Among the footage of a community on the edge of oblivion was Connery riding a bicycle around empty shipyard fabrication sheds. The UK government's response to the crisis was to create the Upper Clyde Shipbuilders (UCS) in 1968, which had about 8,500 workers in five yards - Fairfield's and Stephens on the south bank, Connel's and Yarrow's on the north bank, and John Brown's at Clydebank. In 1971 UCS went into receivership and was refused a government loan. This led to one of the most famous episodes in industrial history - the work-in. The unions, led by Jimmy Reid and Jimmy Airlie, occupied the yard and made a demand of the then Conservative prime minister Edward Heath for the "right to work". In February 1972, the government agreed to retain two yards, Yarrow at Scotstoun and Fairfield's at Govan. Fairfield's was formed into Govan Shipbuilders in 1972, which was itself later nationalised and subsumed into British Shipbuilders in 1977. The government of Margaret Thatcher broke up British Shipbuilders and denationalised it in 1988, when the former Fairfield yard was sold to the Norwegian Kvaerner group. Kvaerner took the yard through another modernisation programme to enable it to specialise in the construction of liquefied natural gas and chemical tankers. But in the late 1990s, the market became depressed and the yard had to find alternative contracts. The yard passed to BAE Systems in 1999 and has found work over the past decade making destroyers and aircraft carriers for the Royal Navy. BAE is a key partner in the construction of the two Queen Elizabeth class aircraft carriers being built at the Portsmouth yard and in Scotland. However, after their construction is complete, there is only expected to be the need for one centre for naval shipbuilding in the UK to build the next generation of Type 26 frigates. The Clyde aircraft carrier work is due to finish in 2015. It is still not clear where Type 26 frigates will be built. There are no other orders on books. Could the sun be setting on a long tradition of Govan shipbuilding?	Scotland was once the shipbuilder to the world and the heart of its industry was sited on the south bank of the River Clyde in the Glasgow district of Govan.
John Terry's measured side-foot shot gave the Blues the lead after the hosts failed to clear their lines when Mata's free-kick hit the outside of the post. Daniel Sturridge's sublime backheel finish when running through one on one with keeper Simon Mignolet made it 2-0. Ji Dong-Won slotted home in injury time to give the Black Cats a glimmer of hope but Chelsea held on. It was a nervy final few seconds but even the most diehard Sunderland supporter would have struggled to argue a draw would have been a fair result. Media playback is not supported on this device Sturridge's outrageous effort when confronted by the onrushing Mignolet was the stand-out moment in an impressive Blues performance, but Mata's influence was the key to their victory. The Spaniard was the creative hub of everything the Blues did, demanding the ball at every opportunity and giving a dazzling display, full of one-touch football, neat passes and crucially, a telling final ball. Blues boss Andre Villas-Boas has openly talked of the need to inject more pace and creativity and Mata granted his wish, playing with urgency and sparking off all that was good about the visitors as they secured a third win in four league games. Deadline-day signing Raul Meireles was as influential as his fellow midfielder, setting up Sturridge's goal with a fine long pass, but it was Mata who caught the eye. Chelsea and Mata started brightly but Sunderland striker Nicklas Bendtner had the first chance of the game only to glance his header wide from a teasing Sebastian Larsson free-kick. Chelsea have for so many years been Drogba and Lampard-based and there is a subtle style change going on behind the scenes. They weren't at their best but it was the best they have played this season and they didn't need to get out of third gear because Sunderland were poor Apart from that effort - and a Stephane Sessegnon strike that was beaten away by the returning Petr Cech late in the half - Chelsea dominated the first period. Nicholas Anelka smashed a shot wide after a swift break and also tested Mignolet with a fierce shot, while Ramires curled a shot wide after a powerful surge. But it was defender Terry who opened the scoring, coolly finishing at the second attempt from Sturridge's excellent cross as Chelsea kept the pressure on after Mata's strike hit the woodwork. Any hopes of a Sunderland revival seemed over as Sturridge, preferred up front to £50m man Fernando Torres, made it 2-0 six minutes after break. The game petered out somewhat after that, although substitute Florent Malouda and Anelka both had chances to extend the lead. Sunderland lacked pace up front and could have done with a nippy forward like the departing Asamoah Gyan to partner Bendtner. Media playback is not supported on this device The Dane typified the home side, showing plenty of endeavour but they looked powerless to prevent a second consecutive home defeat as Chelsea went on to record their 13th win in 14 games against the Black Cats despite Dong-Won's last-gasp effort. Sunderland manager Steve Bruce: "It was very difficult against a very good Chelsea team. They had terrific possession of the ball and we spent that much energy trying to get it back. They were excellent in possession of the ball. We will play against lesser teams than that thankfully. "When we had it, we gave it away too cheaply and that made for a very difficult afternoon. "But for all their possession both their goals were poor from our point of view." Chelsea manager Andre-Villas Boas: "It went very well for us in terms of what we want to achieve, not that we haven't tried to do it before, but it just didn't happen in the other three games. Media playback is not supported on this device "Fortunately, we were able to play the passing game that relates more to how we train, and the team played very, very well. I am very happy with the display. "The 2-1, of course, is avoidable and that brought an edge to the last three minutes, but we can only say that Chelsea deserved to win and we were very consistent in the first and second halves.

Parents of brides cannot invite more than 500 guests, and the number has been limited to 400 for grooms. The government also said that no more than seven main dishes can be served to "ensure that there is no wastage of any food items". An MP has also proposed a bill to impose a similar ban on expensive weddings across India. Weddings are expensive in Kashmir, and the traditional feast, locally called Wazwan, includes a range of vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes. The state government said the order, which comes into effect from 1 April, was issued in response to public complaints about extravagance, waste and intrusive noise. The state had imposed a similar ban in 1984, but it was revoked after protests. Marriages are costly in other parts of India as well, and many people spend lavishly on food, clothes and entertainment. In November, the five-day wedding of businessman and former Karnataka state minister G Janardhana Reddy's daughter, Brahmani, with an estimated cost of about 5bn rupees ($74m; £59m), prompted outrage as millions of Indians struggled with a cash flow crisis. Among the extravagances were gold-plated invitation cards fitted with LCD screens, costing 10m rupees. Here are a few of the world's most expensive weddings:	The government in Indian-administered Kashmir has put curbs on excessively lavish weddings.
Media playback is not supported on this device Meg Lanning hit a composed 55 and Alyssa Healy a rapid 25 as Australia compiled 132-6 amid a mixed England fielding performance. In reply, Charlotte Edwards (31) and Tammy Beaumont (32) added 67 for the first wicket inside 10 overs. But, from there, England lost regular wickets to slump to 127-7. Australia - seeking a fourth straight title - will play New Zealand or West Indies in the final in Kolkata on Sunday. England, meanwhile, miss out on the final for the first time since 2010. Although they arrived at this semi-final having won all four of their group matches, England had already shown plenty of fragility with the bat, collapsing from 59-0 to 109-9 against West Indies and from 42-1 to 92-8 against India. This time, their middle-order woes finally cost them as they squandered the perfect platform laid by Edwards and Beaumont. With seven overs remaining, England needed 45 more with nine wickets in hand, but they succumbed to panic. First Beaumont played an unnecessary slog and was caught at cover, then Natalie Sciver was bowled third ball attempting an overambitious scoop, before Heather Knight smacked Erin Osborne to long-on. From there, England's hopes rested with the out-of-form Sarah Taylor, but her dismissal - caught behind tamely trying a reverse sweep - summed up England's muddled thinking and sealed their demise. After Healy and Elyse Villani got Australia off to a superb start with a partnership of 41 from 27 balls, the Southern Stars were in danger of faltering when both openers were dismissed in quick succession. Lanning came to the crease having passed 30 only once in four innings in the tournament, but the world's top-ranked T20 batter quickly set about demonstrating her class. Scoring heavily behind square on the off side, Lanning hit six fours, adding 36 with Ellyse Perry. As England came back into the game with late wickets, the Australia captain remained a serene presence at the other end - but she could not find any boundaries in the final four overs of the innings as Australia lost momentum. Media playback is not supported on this device It was a mixed performance in the field by England, containing both moments of magic and costly instances of ineptitude. In the closing overs, Sciver brilliantly ran out Alex Blackwell with a direct hit from deep midwicket, and Anya Shrubsole then accounted for Lanning with another superb piece of fielding, shattering the stumps from long-on. However, earlier Edwards' side had fluffed two straightforward run-out chances, with Lanning reprieved by a poor Danielle Wyatt throw and Blackwell surviving after a Shrubsole fumble. Media playback is not supported on this device Crucial runs were also conceded by poor ground fielding, with the whole haphazard display summed up by the comical moment when an inattentive Sciver was hit on the head by Katharine Brunt's throw as she walked back to her bowling mark. England captain Charlotte Edwards: "I think we know a lot about each other and there are no secrets but Australia held their nerve and we didn't, and that is probably the difference. "We didn't start particularly well with the ball but dragged it back and then started brilliantly with the bat and then lost our way. We showed glimpses towards the end of getting it back, but it wasn't quite meant to be." Australia captain Meg Lanning: "We knew the powerplay would be crucial and with the start we got, we got ahead of the game. We knew it would be more difficult when the ball was softer so it was crucial we built on that momentum. "We didn't start as well as we would like with the ball but we began to hit our lengths and the stumps." England coach Mark Robinson: "It is a cruel game, another five runs then we were in a super over. Well done to Australia on the day "There is a little stage fright and we were a little guilty of that in field, but we are not fit enough. Athleticism is a gift, so there is not much we can do about that, but anaerobic fitness we can do something about and we will."	England were knocked out of the Women's World Twenty20 by Australia for the third tournament running with a five-run semi-final defeat in Delhi.
Cryptography was once controlled by the state and deployed only for military and diplomatic ends. But in the 1970s, cryptographer Whitfield Diffie devised a system which took encryption keys away from the state and marked the start of the so-called "Crypto Wars". Whitfield Diffie and three other experts spoke to the BBC World Service Inquiry programme about the tensions at the heart of the spat between Apple and the FBI. In 1975, cryptographer Whitfield Diffie devised "public key cryptography", which revolutionised encryption. "The basic techniques we used until public key cryptography come from around 1500 in the western world, and were known from about 800 in the Middle East. "They are basically arithmetic. Not ordinary integer arithmetic, but something like clock arithmetic - it's 11 o'clock and you wait three hours and you get 2 o'clock - and table lookups. What's the 5th element in the table? What's the 20th element? "The trouble is you can't do them very well without some kind of mechanical computation. A human being can't do enough of those calculations to produce a secure system without making too many mistakes. "Before what we did, you could not have supported cryptography outside a fairly integrated organisation. If you look at the US Department of Defense, it's very large, but very centralised; everybody knows the chain of command. "They can have a trusted entity run by the National Security Agency (NSA) to manage the keys [used by the military and government]. If you were in the military, and it was part of your assignment to talk to somebody securely in another part of the military, they would supply you with a key, and every morning you come out and put one in your teletype machine or phone or whatever. "But the internet is not just meant for friends to talk to friends, it's for everybody to talk to everybody. Until you have public key cryptography you have no way of arranging the keys on demand at a moment's notice for these secure communications. "That's what browsers do with websites all the time. Amazon, eBay, all of the merchants on the internet encrypt at least some of the traffic you have with them, at the very least the payment portion of it. "[At the time] the NSA reacted like any other enterprise that has had a monopoly in a market for a long period of time. Suddenly somebody was treading on its turf, and it made several attempts to recapture its market." Susan Landau is professor of Cyber Security Policy at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. "Public-key cryptography was mathematically elegant and also quite elementary. That's what made it so powerful and so wonderful. "The NSA said 'Wait a minute: this work should be classified.' They had been accustomed to being the only place that cryptography was done. They didn't want a competitor developing algorithms that maybe they would have trouble breaking into. They wanted to hold the keys to the kingdom. "There was a big fight between the academic and industry research community and the NSA. But it was settled fairly amicably, fairly quickly. The next problem was who would control the development of cryptography standards for the US government. "The NSA does this for military and diplomatic communications, but there's a vast need for cryptography for civilian agencies such as health and human services, education, agriculture. The National Bureau of Standards had been doing this in the 1970s but in the 1980s the NSA began pushing in this direction. "Congress, who had always looked more favourably on the civilian side, put the National Institute of Standards and Technology in charge. "But the law also included this little thing about three people from NSA approving certain things. They exercised tremendous control, and kept blocking standards that were more friendly to the commercial sector. That battle went on between 1987 until the mid 1990s. It was quite ugly. "Another battle was over the clipper chip. Clipper was a very hard algorithm with a secure key, but the key was split and was to be shared with agencies of the federal government. The idea was [that] a business person travelling overseas would be able to use a clipper-enabled phone and talk securely with the office back at home. "But if you're doing something illegal the US government will be able to decrypt easily, because the keys are held by its agencies. "It was a complete flop. Outside the US, no one wanted it. Inside the US, no one bought it. It was a total failure. "The controls on cryptography in the 1990s were very odd because they were controls on an export. If you wanted to export a computer or communications device with cryptography, you needed an export licence from the US government. "Much of the time you would get 'We're looking at it, we'll get back to you.' Of course, when you're selling high tech, you don't need a delay of two months, [so] you decide not to have strong encryption within the device - you put in something very weak that the US government will allow to go without a licence. The effect was to not have strong encryption domestically as well as abroad. "In 2000, the US government loosened the controls on export of devices with strong encryption; it looked as if the private sector won the battle." Alan Woodward is an expert in signals intelligence, intelligence gathered from communications, who has worked for the UK government in various roles. "Suppose you got intelligence that people appeared to be mobilising their military forces. You'd need to know whether that was a prelude to war, or just an exercise. One of the ways to do that was by analysing the signals and communications traffic going around on the other side. "In the early 2000s, it got harder. Previously they'd had the ability to decrypt things that were weakly encrypted. You could throw a super computer at the problem and try all the possible keys until you unlock the message. "You just physically couldn't do that for the number of encrypted messages that were starting to pile up. But also, the forms of encryption were becoming stronger. The encryption that was being used by governments themselves back in the 1970s was called the Data Encryption Standard. With a modern PC, you can break that in a matter of seconds. That kind of evolution in encryption and decryption has been going on ever since. "It got worse because there were various other forms of technology that were based on encryption, where you were able to remain anonymous, completely hidden. There's a thing called the Tor network which causes security agencies a great deal of trouble, because you don't even know where that person is based, never mind who they're communicating with. "Governments recognised that there wasn't a lot you could do about this technically or from a policy perspective. It's out there. So what you have to do is  be able to get at it before it is encrypted or after it's decrypted. "They recognised that they needed to work more closely with the technology providers because they were the ones that owned the infrastructure that was being used.  They were the ones running it; it was no longer governments and state telecommunications companies. "They had very good relationships. Microsoft produced a suite of software called Cofee (Computer Online Forensic Evidence Extractor), which is only given to government and Law Enforcement Agencies. It's a forensic tool that allows you to analyse Windows systems. "You used to be able to go along to Apple and they could unlock the phone. With messaging services it was possible for governments with the right authorisation to go along and sit in the middle of the conversation and look at the messages in a non-encrypted form. "All of that changed when Edward Snowden got his leaks out." Jeff Larson is a reporter at New York investigative newsroom ProPublica. It worked with the Guardian newspaper on the sensitive material leaked by Edward Snowden from the US National Security Agency in 2013. "I had seen something in the Snowden tranche of documents that made me suspicious that the NSA and GCHQ had been working behind the scenes to crack encryption that powers internet technologies. "When you log into your bank or Twitter or Facebook, your web browser talks to those servers over what's known as TLS, which is an encryption layer that protects the confidentiality of that traffic. "The intelligence agencies - not only NSA and GCHQ, but Canada and Australia and New Zealand- had spent 10 years and untold billions of dollars trying to break these fundamental encryption technologies. "They honed things, like their power with super computers, but they were also able to mount a programme of inserting back doors into cryptographic software, and - perhaps a bit more troubling - the NSA launched a covert campaign to influence the very standards that programmers rely on to create encryption. "So standards bodies write up 'here's how encryption works, here's how you implement it in your software', and the NSA was actually working against that effort. "Ever since [the Snowden revelations were published in] 2013, there's been quite a movement to further encrypt the internet. "I think there's been an awakening on the part of private companies that it is important to their users to keep [their data] confidential and secret. "Apple saw these revelations about the overreach of intelligence services and law enforcement services, and created a phone that was harder to crack because they wanted to increase the security of their users. I do believe that. "The Apple case is very hard. I see the arguments on both sides. I see the fact that the FBI wants access to this information, and I also see Apple's need to protect its customers' privacy. "I hope that we come to a conclusion that is more open and transparent. What I would say is I like that this fight is happening in public so that we can have debates like this." The Inquiry is broadcast on the BBC World Service on Tuesdays from 12:05 GMT.

The clash between Apple and the FBI over whether the company should provide access to encrypted data on a locked iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino attackers highlights debates about privacy and data security which have raged for decades.
An emotional Murray, 29, secured a thrilling 7-5 4-6 6-2 7-5 victory to make it GB's most successful day at an overseas Games with five gold medals. The see-saw match featured 14 breaks of serve in front of a raucous crowd. Murray's win comes five weeks after he claimed his second Wimbledon title and four years after London 2012 success. Both men looked exhausted in the fourth set of a gruelling four-hour contest, with Murray breaking down in tears after finishing off his gritty opponent. Find out how to get into tennis in our special guide. The crowd on Centre Court were boisterous throughout, with plenty of Argentine support for 27-year-old Del Potro, although emotions did spill over near the climax when two fans were ejected. Murray said the final was one of the toughest he had played in and cast doubt on the chances of winning a third gold in Tokyo in 2020. "Four years is a long time and so many things can change," he said. "Who knows about Tokyo? At 33, I'm not sure I'll be at the same level." Del Potro's silver medal signifies his continued return to form, with his past three seasons disrupted by a wrist injury. "Mentally I can only imagine how frustrating that must have been to keep going through the same problem and having to try and come back," said Murray. "He deserves a lot of credit and he should be very proud." Del Potro beat world number one Novak Djokovic in the first round despite being stuck in a lift for 40 minutes before the match. The 2009 US Open champion and London 2012 bronze medallist then defeated 2008 champion Rafael Nadal in an epic three-hour semi-final a day before facing Murray. "I left the last of my toenails on the court," said Del Potro. "I was tremendously tired. It was the crowd that made me keep running." He added: "When I look at my medal I'm so happy for that, but I've just lost a great final against Andy and I was close to the gold medal. "He played better in the important moments and is a great champion." In Murray, Del Potro came up against a player on a career-defining run in the final. After inspiring Britain to a first Davis Cup win in 79 years in November, Murray was voted the BBC's Sports Personality of the Year, before reaching the Australian and French Open finals and winning Wimbledon for the second time. He also became a father earlier this year and led GB out at the opening ceremony of Rio 2016 as his country's flag bearer. On the court, he has lost just one of his past 30 matches, a run stretching back six months, and has been world number two since November, barring a one-week drop to third in May. BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller Murray looked all along as if he would be too good and just too strong, but he had to play a quite brilliant game to prevent the match going to a deciding set. Some exceptional defence and some awesome returns allowed him to break back for five-all - and two games later he was a double Olympic champion. He may look back on this achievement as the greatest of his career. It will mean even more to him that he shared it with Max Whitlock, Justin Rose and Jason Kenny on such a special day for Team GB. Earlier, Japan's Kei Nishikori claimed his first Olympic medal by beating Spain's 14-time Grand Slam winner Nadal for men's singles bronze. Nadal, 30, who had already won men's doubles gold, recovered from 5-2 down in the second set to level the match, but lost 6-2 6-7 (1-7) 6-3. Nishikori, 26, had never been past the quarter-finals at a Games.	Britain's Andy Murray became the first male tennis player to win two Olympic singles titles by beating Argentina's Juan Martin del Potro in Rio.
The pop singer from Ely, Cardiff, topped the list following an online vote from a shortlist of 30 greats. In second place was Blackwood-born James Dean Bradfield of Manic Street Preachers, with musical theatre performer John Owen Jones coming in third. Sir Tom Jones and Dame Shirley Bassey, finished fourth and fifth respectively. Picking up his award, Mr Stevens said: "The fact that it's a public vote means a lot to me, so a big thank you to the people who voted." Twelve judges from a range of musical disciplines selected a shortlist of 30 for the listeners' poll. Radio Wales editor Steve Austins said: "While I'm a little surprised at the outcome, the people of Wales have spoken and there is no doubting Shaky's contribution to British music history. "In fact his was the very first record I bought. "Any winner from such a formidable shortlist is bound to create heated debate but the poll reminds us just how blessed with talent we are here in Wales." Shakin' Stevens shot to fame in 1981 with the number one hit single This Ole House. His platinum-selling career spans more than four decades and he is still recording and touring across the world. Wynne Evans' countdown show on Radio Wales can be heard here.	Shakin' Stevens has been voted Wales' Greatest Living Voice by listeners of BBC Radio Wales.
After an impressive year on loan at Torquay in the National League last season, the 20-year-old has now quickly established himself in the Vale first team under new boss Bruno Ribeiro. "He's being scouted by Championship clubs," Smurthwaite told BBC Stoke. "You could see he's come back a man from being at Torquay for a year." Smurthwaite says that Vale youth product Smith will be offered a new deal by the League One club in the next few weeks, in preparation for what he expects to be firmed-up interest when the transfer window reopens on 1 January. "I anticipate there'll be some interest in the window, not just at the end of the season," added Smurthwaite. "But it's a long time between now and January. "There will be a new contract offered to him, as he's on a boy's wage compared to the rest of the squad. "He's obviously making himself known. And we've been having dialogue with his agent ever since he came in and played his first game in the first team." Vale stand ninth in League One, on the back of their run of three clean sheets with which they started the new campaign. Smith has also weighed in with three goals - two in the league and the other in the 1-0 EFL Trophy win over Derby County Under-23s.	Port Vale chairman Norman Smurthwaite is anticipating "interest" in young defender Nathan Smith following his outstanding start to the season.
The A547 at Meliden, between Rhuddlan and Prestatyn, was closed after 14:00 BST on Saturday after the collision. The child was taken to hospital, with the extent of his injuries not yet known. Police confirmed traffic had resumed on the road after 16:00 BST.	A Denbighshire road has been reopened after a boy was hit by a car, North Wales Police says.
About 2,000 pieces dating back more than 1,000 years were spotted on the seabed by members of a diving club, the Israeli Antiquities Authority said. At first the group thought the coins were toys, but quickly realised the significance of their discovery. The Antiquities Authority said the find was "so valuable that it's priceless". Divers were exploring an ancient harbour in Caesarea when they came across the gold. They collected several coins and quickly returned to the shore to inform the director of the club. Experts from the authority called to the site uncovered "almost 2,000 gold coins in different denominations" circulated by the Fatimid Caliphate, which ruled much of the Middle East and North Africa from 909 to 1171. Kobi Sharvit, director of the marine archaeology unit at the Israel Antiquities Authority, said excavations would be carried out in the hope of shedding more light on the origin of the treasure. He added: "There is probably a shipwreck there of an official treasury boat which was on its way to the central government in Egypt with taxes that had been collected. "Perhaps the treasure of coins was meant to pay the salaries of the Fatimid military garrison which was stationed in Caesarea and protected the city." He said another theory was that the treasure belonged to a large merchant ship that traded with the coastal cities and the port on the Mediterranean Sea. The haul, which weighs 9kg (20lb), is believed to have been exposed as a result of winter storms. It is now the property of the state and there was no finders' fee.	Scuba divers have inadvertently discovered the largest trove of gold coins ever found off Israel's Mediterranean coast.
Lawyer Amanda Telfer, 43, died when three frames fell on her as she walked past a building site in London. The frames had been left unprotected and unrestrained against a wall, in Hanover Square, Mayfair, in 2012. Kelvin Adsett, 64, from Slough, was found guilty of manslaughter by gross negligence, following a six-week trial at the Old Bailey. Adsett, a supervisor for Slough-based IS Europe Limited, was also convicted of failure to take reasonable care for safety whilst at work. Damian Lakin-Hall, 50, from Cobham, Surrey, was found also guilty of the same charge but acquitted of Ms Telfer's manslaughter. Prosecutor Duncan Atkinson QC told the jury it was "obvious to anyone" the heavy frames, which together weighed 1,444lb (655kg), carried a "clear and serious risk of death", to anyone nearby. "There were a series of obvious and, in many cases, straightforward steps that could have been taken to avoid that risk, ranging from cancellation, delay, refusal of delivery on the one hand, to the storage, the use of straps and barriers," he said. "None were taken by any of the defendants and Amanda Telfer died as a result." IS Europe Limited was also found guilty of failure to ensure the health, safety and welfare of employees at work and exposing another to a risk to health and safety. Steven Rogers, 62, from Sawbridgeworth, Hertfordshire, was cleared of a single charge of failure to take reasonable care for safety while at work as an employee of Westgreen Construction. Charges against Westgreen Construction, Claire Gordon, Drawn Metal Ltd and Stephen Rogers were all discharged. Judge Peter Rook described it as a "tragic case" and scheduled sentencing to take place on 5 May.	A man has been convicted over the death of a woman who was crushed by window frames weighing more than half a tonne.
There are pubs where they play music and then there are pubs where music takes a more prominent role. Sometimes, however, there are pubs where drinking seems almost a sideline to the main business of musical appreciation. Walking into Sandy Bell's in Edinburgh, you feel it sits very firmly in the latter category. Long a focus for the Scottish traditional music scene, recent years have seen more performances, bigger audiences and some very talented players. And as far as many are concerned, that tells you something about Scotland today. "There's more pride in Scotland generally," says Archie, a smiling accordion player from Skye. "You'll get pubs that used to be trendy pubs, with CDs playing, and now they have folk music sessions." For Sam, who plays violin, it's a particular source of pride that so many visitors from abroad now seem captivated by the melodies of her native land. "You've got tourists from Canada, Australia, America, Japan, China. I've always liked this sort of music. It does make me feel like I'm celebrating being Scottish." In a week when Scotland's First Minister unveiled plans for a possible second referendum on independence, the strength of nationalist sentiment has usually been gauged by polls. And much to the frustration of Ms Sturgeon's Scottish National Party, support for independence has barely budged from the 45% who voted for it in the previous referendum of 2014. Yet many believe that Scots now have a far stronger sense of their country's distinct identity, a sentiment that polls seem to miss. Among them is Henry McLeish, the Labour First Minister of Scotland from 2001-02, who extols what he believes are Scotland's particular qualities. "We're more internationalist, we're more open to immigration," he says. It is the Brexit vote and its aftermath that has done more than anything else to shift his opinion. The majority of Scots voted to remain in the European Union, in contrast to the UK vote to leave. "I was a diehard unionist. Politics has changed, I've had my Britishness squeezed out of me. It's more in sorrow than in anger that I am ready to say that I could support an independent Scotland." Michelle Ferguson is not sorry about her increasingly strong sense of being Scottish, but it has come as something of a surprise. Once an employee of a large multinational, she used to live in London and described herself as British. But Michelle has now become managing director of a social enterprise, St Andrews First Aid Supplies and Training, which ploughs all its profits back into the local community. The experience seems to have changed her sense of identity, as much as her attitude to business. "Here in Scotland, people really want to make a difference, it's not all about the big bucks," she says. "I now feel that if I had to fill in a form… I would have to say I am Scottish." Michelle does not want to say whether she voted for Scottish independence, nor whether she would do so in the event of another referendum. And the fact is that whatever resurgence of Scottish pride there may be, the Scottish National Party has so far failed to capitalise on it. But then the Party has always been keen to emphasise the alleged economic benefits of independence, rather than playing the identity game and appealing to voters' "tartan blood". "A vote for independence should not just be about how we feel, although that is important," says Ben Macpherson, an SNP Member of the Scottish Parliament, representing Edinburgh North and Leith. Yet pushed on the issue, Macpherson agrees with the suggestion of growing national self-awareness, and hints that it might help his cause. "Scotland is an increasingly more confident country than when I was a child. More and more, Scotland is starting to understand that Scotland is ready to govern itself."	The Scottish Government has published a bill outlining provisional plans for another referendum on Scottish independence, plans which some believe coincide with a renewed sense of Scotland's separate identity.
Detentions by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency jumped to 41,318 between January 22 of this year and the end of April. That was up from 30,028 arrests in about the same period last year. The dragnet follows presidential orders widening the scope of who can be targeted for immigration violations. Almost two-thirds of those arrested this year had criminal convictions, said ICE. But more than half the increase in arrests was of immigrants who had committed no crime other than being in the US without permission. President Donald Trump has stepped up immigration enforcement to target such undocumented immigrants. Acting director of ICE Thomas Homan said on a call on Wednesday with reporters that immigrants who pose a threat to national security or have criminal records are still a priority for his agency. But he added: "There is no category of aliens off the table." ICE will continue to target people who have been issued a final order of removal by an immigration judge, even if they have not committed another crime, he vowed. "Those that enter the country illegally, they do violate the law, that is a criminal act," acting director of ICE Thomas Homan said on the call. "When a federal judge makes a decision and issues an order that order needs to mean something," Mr Homan said. President Barack Obama was also criticised for deporting a large number of immigrants, but most of them were recent illegal border crossers. President Trump's signature campaign pledge to build an expanded wall on the US-Mexico border is in limbo after Congress denied funding for it in a recent budget deal. But his tough rhetoric on border security appears to be having an impact on immigration enforcement. The number of people caught crossing the border with Mexico is down significantly since the beginning of the year, according US Customs and Border Protection data. Immigration advocates have raised concerns about the stepped up enforcement in the interior of the country.	US arrests of suspected illegal immigrants rose by 38% in the first 100 days of Donald Trump's presidency, according to government data.
Several species' vision was studied by an international team to identify this ultra-violet (UV) sensitivity. The findings, published in the journal Conservation Biology, claimed habitats and migration could be disrupted. The flashes, or corona, occur when charge builds up in a cable and is released into the air. The international team, including scientists from University College London and the Arctic University of Norway, measured the spectrum of light emitted by these bursts of charge. They worked out that although the light was invisible to us, it contained wavelengths seen by many other mammals. "Most mammals will let some [UV light] into their eye," explained UCL vision expert Prof Glen Jeffery, one of the lead researchers in this project. "We're weird - us and monkeys - because we don't see UV. Most animals do." The first animal to reveal its UV sensitivity was the reindeer. And, as the researchers explained, reindeers' avoidance of the power lines running across the Arctic tundra was part of the inspiration for this project. Dr Nicholas Tyler, the other lead author, said it had been assumed that rather than avoiding the power cables themselves, animals steered clear of passages cut in forested areas before pylons were installed. "Forest animals will not cross clear-cuts," he said. "But for us in the Arctic, avoidance of power lines is difficult to explain - there are no trees, yet the reindeer still avoid the power lines." The animals keep as much as 5km (3 miles) from either side of the cables. "This has been a mystery," Dr Tyler added. "We have now come up with a mechanism [to explain it]." This research required a detailed understanding of animal vision, which was where Prof Jeffery came in. Having discovered in 2011 that reindeer eyes were sensitive to UV light, Prof Jeffery went on to study the eyes of almost 40 mammal species, revealing all were UV-sensitive. Since, as the researchers added, coronas "happen on all power lines everywhere", the avoidance of the flashes could be having a global impact on wildlife. "It has always been assumed that power lines - masts and the cables strung between them - were passive structures standing immobile in the terrain, and therefore inoffensive for animals," said Dr Tyler. "As a result of this work, we now consider them as chains of flashing light stretching across the tundra in the winter darkness, and that's why the animals find them so offensive." The random and unpredictable nature of these flashes were particularly problematic, he added, as the animals could not easily adapt to them. Prof Jeffery said he hoped power companies would now consider ways to address the issue.	Animals around the world could be scared away from power cables because these give off UV flashes invisible to humans, scientists have said.
The yellow warning will remain in force until 11:00 on Sunday. Forecasters said showers accompanied by widespread sub-zero temperatures would see ice form on many untreated roads. Some snow is expected even at low levels in northern Scotland and other areas could see 2-3cm fall on higher ground. A Met office forecaster said: "Over northern Scotland showers will fall as snow to low levels. "Elsewhere within the warning area these showers will be turning increasingly wintry, with the main snow level down to between 100 and 200m by the end of the night. "Locally 2 or 3cm of snow is possible above 200m."	A  weather warning has been issued for most parts of Scotland, with drivers urged to be aware of a risk of ice and snow.
The 25-year-old moved to the Red Rose from Somerset in 2013 and his new deal ties him to the club until 2019. Short-format specialist Buttler has scored England's three fastest ODI centuries, including a 46-ball ton against Pakistan last year. "Jos is one of the most talented cricketers in the game," said cricket director and head coach Ashley Giles. "His presence in last year's T20 Blast final at Edgbaston was a factor in us winning the competition. "Jos is a great guy to have in the dressing room too and his experience at international level really benefits the squad." Buttler, who has been playing in the Indian Premier League with Mumbai Indians, will return to Lancashire for Friday's T20 Blast home game against Durham.	England wicketkeeper Jos Buttler has signed a new three-year contract with Lancashire.
Kevin Patrick Dawes, 33, was abducted in 2012 as he entered Syria. US officials told the Washington Post that the Syrian government never acknowledged detaining Mr Dawes, but they believe the government or an affiliated group was holding him. The State Department said Mr Dawes was turned over to Russian authorities. The Russia government has been backing the government of President Bashar al-Assad amid a civil war, which is now in its sixth year. The Czech government, which represents US diplomatic interests in Syria, helped secure his release. State Department spokesman John Kirby said the US is working with the Czech officials to free Austin Tice and other missing or detained Americans in Syria. Mr Tice, a journalist, disappeared in August 2012 while working in Syria. He appeared blindfolded in a video a month after his abduction but has not been heard from since.	A US freelance photographer who has been held in Syria for almost four years has been released, the State Department said.
Retailers must now ensure the products are covered up and no longer in public view unless a customer asks for them. Shop managers and assistants who break the law could face fines of up to Â£5,000 and six months in prison. The move follows similar restrictions introduced for larger stores and supermarkets in 2012. Other outlets such as pubs and clubs also have to keep cigarettes out of sight. Cardiff retailer Bobby Singh called the ban "pathetic" and said he did not believe it would stop people smoking. Public Health Wales backed the new law and said the restrictions were a "very important development in improving health in Wales". A spokesman added: "They will play an important role in reducing the appeal of smoking."	Display restrictions on cigarettes and tobacco products sold by small traders in Wales have come into force.
NHS England guidelines say that 85% of patients should wait a maximum of 62 days to begin their first treatment following referral from their GP. But figures show this slipped to 84.4% from January to March this year. Charities Cancer Research UK and Macmillan Cancer Support both said it was a worrying sign. The target for treating people diagnosed with cancer within 62 days fell from 85.8% during the previous quarter to 84.4% in the first three months of 2014. Mike Hobday, director of policy and research at Macmillan Cancer Support, said the number of trusts missing this target had doubled over the last year. "This is a clear warning sign that the NHS is under huge strain. "The UK already has some of the worst cancer survival rates in Europe. "More patients are now facing delays, which means more patients are facing anxiety for longer and more lives are being put at risk. "We're very worried that the coordination of cancer care is getting worse and that cancer is being overlooked in the new NHS." He said cancer patients were set to increase from two million to three million by 2020. Sarah Woolnough, executive director of policy and information at Cancer Research UK, said some patients were being failed. "The breach of the '62 day target' is very concerning, particularly as four in 10 of those who aren't treated within two months are having to wait three months or more. "These targets exist to encourage swift diagnosis of cancer and access to treatment, which is vital to improve survival rates. "Patients want confidence that suspected cancer is taken seriously and prioritised by the NHS. We hope urgent action will be taken to ensure this breach is a one off." Sean Duffy, national clinical director for cancer for NHS England, said work must be done to make sure standards are met. "It is vital cancer patients are diagnosed and treated quickly so they have the best possible chance of recovery," he said. "Latest figures show nationally the NHS has met and exceeded seven out of eight cancer waiting time standards. But there is variation in meeting the challenging standards, and national performance against one of the targets has dipped." He said clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) were working with local providers in areas where the standard is not being met to ensure patients are treated quickly. Other figures released by NHS England on cancer waiting times showed the number of people seen by a specialist within two weeks of an urgent GP referral for suspected cancer also dropped from 95.6% to 95%. For people urgently referred for breast symptoms, where cancer is not suspected, 93.9% are being seen within two weeks, compared to 95.5% previously. The target is 93%. In total, 60,425 patients with breast symptoms where cancer was not initially suspected were seen in the first three months of this year after being urgently referred.	A key government target for treating people diagnosed with suspected cancer has been breached for the first time since it was introduced in 2009.
A spokesman for the zoo said it was hard to predict a specific date for any cub being born, and that the breeding season can last until late September. Tian Tian, who arrived at the zoo as part of a breeding pair with Yang Guang in 2011, was artificially inseminated earlier this year. The zoo said she was being closely monitored. This is the fifth time Tian Tian has been artificially inseminated. She had previously given birth to twins in China but all attempts to produce a cub at Edinburgh Zoo have failed. A spokesman for RZSS Edinburgh Zoo said: "Giant panda breeding is a very complicated process but we believe that Tian Tian is pregnant. "Although a specific date was suggested, like all babies it's hard to predict precisely and the panda breeding season can last until late September. "Tian Tian is being closely monitored by our expert team and we will be the first to share any news as soon as we can." A spokesman for animal rights campaigners OneKind said: "This poor panda cub will never be introduced to the wild and will only ever know a life in captivity. "To make matters worse, to produce a cub, Tian Tian has been subjected to repeated invasive procedures since coming to Edinburgh. "This has not been in the interest of pandas or conservation, and appears instead to be driven by the pursuit of PR and gate fees. "If you want to help pandas, you don't need to go and see one at a zoo. Just make a donation to conservation charities conserving pandas in their natural habit instead." News of the pregnancy came to light after documents were released to the Edinburgh Evening News under the Freedom of Information Act. If a cub was born, it would be returned to China at the age of two - mimicking natural dispersal age in the wild. Panda reproduction is a notoriously difficult process, with females only ovulating once a year. Tian Tian (Sweetie) and Yang Guang (Sunshine) are the only giant pandas living in the UK. They arrived on loan from China in December 2011 and are due to remain at Edinburgh Zoo for a decade. The zoo first announced it was in negotiations to bring a pair of giant pandas to Scotland in 2008. The pair were brought to the UK under a historic agreement between the UK and Chinese governments. Described as a gift from China, they were the first giant pandas to live in the UK for 17 years.	The UK's only female panda, Tian Tian, is believed to be pregnant, according to Edinburgh Zoo.
"There's a lot going on right now,"  the singer tells us. And she's not wrong. The follow-up to her Mercury Prize-nominated debut, 2013's Sing To The Moon, is imminent. Second album The Dreaming Room is due in June and her newest track Phenomenal Woman has just debuted as Annie Mac's hottest record on BBC Radio 1. "And then we have probably the most important live moment on TV in this country today," she adds. "It's all potentially extremely exciting - and that just means that I'm naturally terrified." The singer's struggles with stage fright and anxiety are well-documented and live TV is a particular fear. Describing the concept as "just hellish", she tells us: "I'd rather die. That's how I feel sometimes - I think, 'if I dropped dead I wouldn't have to do it!'." So, it's perhaps surprising that the singer let us tag along as she kicked off the new series of Later... with Jools Holland. But it seems BBC Two's esteemed music show has a special place in her heart. "In the musician's world, you say 'Jools Holland' and all of a sudden you've got massive respect - it's like saying you got Glastonbury." Her third time on Later... she calls respected musician and presenter Holland a "genuine champion". "He called me this afternoon just to say that he'd been listening to my new record and he wanted to tell me specifically what song and what parts and why. "I tell you, in the TV world, it's not the kind of place where there's room for those kind of genuine interactions, just because there's so much pressure on everyone. It's very special." Here the diary of Laura's day. Tour manager Paul picks us up in sunny east London. Laura's assistant Mariama is laden with popcorn and snacks as we pile into the silver Mercedes van bound for the studios in Kent. The singer takes some me-time behind her shades, safe in the knowledge it's going to be a long day. "I'm such a weird person to be around before anything big," she admits. "I can't normally talk, so my team tend to just leave me to it, but I'll pick up. "Right now I want to be jumping up, but you don't want to celebrate before the main event, so I'm just trying to be as relaxed as I can." We arrive to the sounds of Kano and his brass section sound-checking. He's on the bill along with Paul Simon, The Coral, Jason Isbell and Lake Street Dive. Laura has the honour of opening and closing both the live and pre-recorded shows, something she says she's "glad you only find out on the day". "I'm doing Phenomenal Woman, Kiss My Feet - which the Jools team requested - and Overcome, the first single, which featured Nile Rogers. "I wanted to explode back onto the scene with something that was captivating in a much rawer and darker way. That's why there's dance and so much movement this time around, and why it's such a visual album." Backstage the band are split across two dressing rooms - one for the boys and one for the girls, where we're quickly made welcome as they debate which of the many black items of clothing they've brought will get worn. "There's nine of us - it's huge by pop terms, but I refused to compromise," says Laura. "With Sing To The Moon, six of us were trying to sound like an orchestra and a choir. It was a stress. "My sister Dionne went from violin to guitar - literally learnt the guitar [and] is killing it - my brother's playing cello. It feels much more like a band than me trying to do the solo artist thing. We feel like a really solid family." Still in her fur-lined boots and denim dress from the journey, Laura and the band head to the camera rehearsal. Jools arrives and gives Laura a hug, waving hello to the production team. Giant white cue cards are being written to help him introduce the acts. Running through each of their tracks twice, Laura sports her new keytar in place of her trademark piano. "Lady Mariama was up until 4am trying to make my keytar white. I mean what the hell is that about?" she laughs. "Initially it was a joke idea, I was just messing about jamming with it, but it made so much sense. I'm not stuck behind anything in a static way anymore, I can move and I can see people. If I want to turn and feel the band I can do that. We have such a good time now." Time for some nourishment. The team ("there's like millions of them... making it work") are handed pocket money for the canteen, while Laura retreats to her dressing room. As well as make-up, wardrobe and calming those nerves, she also has a TV interview to fit in. "I used to not eat, I couldn't eat. But I've learned to, so you don't drop off after one song. I have meatballs and sweet potato fries. And a balance of water and red wine." "[Designer] Alex Noble has done a lot of my clothes recently," says Laura. "He is just on another planet. He text me yesterday and I was just weeping emojis because the clothes are just... I mean you'll see with the outfit tonight. "I made a visual essay for the album, this massive book [filled with] images, as stimulus for new music but also to help anybody I might be collaborating with. Stylists or people in the label, anyone could take the book and go 'oh yeah, I'm listening and I'm looking'. "It means I get to talk less. That's probably surprising to some people because I do love to natter! But it helps." Minutes before show time, Laura's designer and assistant are still huddled together in one of the dressing rooms with a needle and thread and the singer's fabulous outfit in their hands. She's set to do an interview at Jools's famous piano, but the purple corset she'll be wearing (with matching super-flared trousers) will be too tight to sit down in. Cue furious unpicking and re-stitching. Eventually it's decided she'll do the interview standing up. Problem solved. With the audience in place and schooled on how to cheer and clap in the correct manner, Laura's up first - opening the pre-recorded show with Maya Angelou-inspired anthem Phenomenal Woman. "If you're first out of the blocks - you're the thing in the room that makes the first sound. I've been second and third before and everybody breathes when the sound's been made," says Laura. There's mild panic when the lighting desk freezes after The Coral perform, but after a few minutes of confusion they're rolling again. Later, a respectful hush descends as Paul Simon performs Sounds Of Silence in the centre of the studio. "He made me cry so much," says Laura. "I kept thinking, 'why didn't I bring Mum to this gig?'. She was raised on Simon and Garfunkel. "I ended up thinking about my whole life, my creative life... what is this all about? Here I am literally stood in front of Mr Paul Simon." With all the stars limbered up (and the shortest of toilet breaks), the second show goes live on BBC Two. "It's an amazing feeling because you know that it's happening now and everybody's tuned in, but at the same time - the fear and the dread. You can't correct anything, so whatever comes out is it. " Laura ends the live show on a high with Phenomenal Woman. "That for me was surprisingly wonderful, because live television literally - there's nothing that I'm more terrified of! And the live performance was better than the pre-record - what?!" It's all over. The audience files out and the set's dismantled as artists and their teams pack up their gear and rush to congratulate each other. US outfit Lake Street Dive collar Laura for a picture, while she and sister Dionne seek out Kano for a snap ("Because he's fine. And obviously amazing"). "I always forget how emotionally exhausting it is," says Laura. "The amount I invest into any performance is always bucket loads of sweat or tension that doesn't get released until I'm in that moment. "That's the uniqueness of a show like Jools's - you are getting that concentrated performance." So what now? "Everybody laughs at me because I literally make a beeline for my bed after. I'll probably eat again later because I always get a major appetite, which is why I have this thing [grabs belly area] that will never go away. "But yeah, I just conk out. If I think about stuff I'll go nuts, because you've just put something out. "I mean I haven't had a child, but I imagine - like when you have a baby - it's out there. I can't push it back in!" You can catch the extended edition of Later... with Jools Holland on BBC Two on Friday 22 April at 23:15 BST or watch Tuesday night's live episode on the iPlayer now.	We go behind the scenes with singer Laura Mvula as she prepares to debut her new material and kick off the 48th series of Later... with Jools Holland.
The sign outside Chimes cafe in Machynlleth, Powys, says: "The more you weigh, the harder you are to kidnap! Stay safe. Eat cake!!" April, five, went missing on 1 October 2012 near her home, sparking the biggest search in UK history. The cafe's owner said the sign was not meant to be distasteful or offensive. She added the sign had been on "display for many weeks" and she had "only received one comment". "April Jones's family have been in here recently, when the sign was up, and have not said anything," she said. However, she admitted she could "appreciate how others would interpret the message", but believes those who have complained "have taken it the wrong way". Machynlleth resident, Angharad Penrhyn Jones, took to Twitter to say: "A sign outside a cafe in #Machynlleth: "The more you weigh, the harder it is to get kidnapped. Eat cake!" In view of #AprilJones, shocking. "I went to talk to cafe owner and apparently the sign is 'humorous' and the kidnapping happened 'years ago', and I am being 'hypersensitive.' Author and former parliamentary candidate, Mike Parker, said: "I think the sign is totally inappropriate and my first thought was how distasteful it was considering what had happened previously in the town". The cafe is situated behind the landmark clock tower in Machynlleth, which played a prominent visual role during the search for April when a large pink ribbon was placed on the railings outside. Mark Bridger, 47, of Ceinws, Powys, was found guilty of abducting and murdering April in a sexually motivated attack and must spend the rest of his life behind bars. Her remains have never been found.	A cafe owner has defended a sign urging people to eat cake to avoid being kidnapped in the town where April Jones was abducted and murdered in 2012.
The site - which is owned by Google - is launching a competition for teenagers to create an experiment that could be carried out in space. Two winning ideas will be tested by the crew of the International Space Station. Google chairman Eric Schmidt recently criticised science and technology education in the UK. Delivering the annual McTaggart lecture in Edinburgh, Mr Schmidt said the country needed to reignite children's passion for subjects such as engineering and maths. In addition to having their experiment run in space, the winners will get to experience weightlessness on a zero-g airplane flight, and have the option to either undergo astronaut training in Russia, or to watch the rocket launch in Japan which takes their idea into space. When the experiments are eventually run, the results will be streamed live on YouTube. The competition is divided into two age groups. 14-16 years, and 17-18 years. Alongside Prof Hawking, the judging panel consists of former Astronauts Leland Melvin, Frank De Winne, Akihiko Hoshide and noted "space tourist" Guy LalibertÃ©.	YouTube has enlisted the help of Prof Stephen Hawking in the hunt for budding young scientists.
The stand-in captain faced 535 balls across two innings, moving from 174 not out overnight to end 219 not out in Surrey's first-innings score of 483. Following on, he then made 68 in Surrey's 166-3 to keep Hampshire at bay and prompt handshakes at 16:50 BST. The draw sees third-placed Hampshire claim 12 points, while Surrey take 10 points and stay sixth in Division One. Burns' epic effort saw him stay in the field for all but 10 overs of the entire match, as he defied Hampshire's bowling efforts on a flat Oval pitch. The left-hander was dropped twice in the slip cordon in his career-best 219, but was the only one to resist as Ian Holland (3-37) dismissed Tom Curran (53), Amar Virdi and Mark Footitt to force the follow-on after Surrey began the day on 410-7. Mark Stoneman (47) and Burns then put on an opening stand of 109 before Holland's medium pace had Stoneman lbw and Scott Borthwick bowled in a single over. Sean Ervine became the only man to dismiss Burns in 756 minutes of play when he missed a ball down the leg side, but Jason Roy and Dominic Sibley continued on until the conclusion. Surrey captain Rory Burns told BBC Radio London: "I'm really pleased that we've fought that hard to get the draw and the extra five points, and obviously pretty happy with how I've played. "We had to bat seven sessions to get us to safety and that's all I was thinking. "There were some jitters in the nineties and I got a lifeline, which was quite nice. When I was getting close to 200, I was more thinking about the situation of getting to the follow-on mark. "They're a good side and they played really well. We managed to hold on and get ourselves to safety, so it was honours even on a flat wicket."	Rory Burns scored 287 runs in more than 12 hours at the crease to earn Surrey a draw with Hampshire at The Oval.
Media playback is not supported on this device The takeover, which would include the Rodney Parade ground, has already been approved by the WRU and Dragons boards. It needs to be ratified by 75 per cent of Newport RFC shareholders next month. Dragons chief executive Stuart Davies agreed the decision was pivotal, adding: "It is a hugely important moment in the history of Newport RFC, the Dragons and Rodney Parade." He warned that holding company Rodney Parade Ltd faced going into liquidation of a deal was not agreed. The shareholders have been issued with a document providing information on the central issues. It also includes an open letter from Tony Brown, one of the two main financial backers, advocating the deal. Rugby union has been played at Rodney Parade since 1877, and the ground is used by the Dragons regional side, Newport RFC and League Two football club Newport County. The venue is in need of updating, with the pitch suffering from water-logging problems that have led to football and rugby matches being abandoned or postponed. The deal on offer would see: Davies described the Dragons current financial position - set out in the documents sent to shareholders - as "not healthy" and suggested a refusal to go ahead with the takeover could lead to the end of rugby at Rodney Parade. "It all points to one thing. Rugby stops and the ground stops." "It's an historic venue known the world over and the protection of the venue has been at the heart of this," he said. "It's an incredibly important evening and we have done everything we can to ensure everything is understood and more importantly the implications of it not being supported. "When you read through the circular and see the accounts you realise what our trading position is. "Our financial situation is not healthy so the circular clearly sets out in the event a "no vote" the directors are likely to call in an administrator or receiver and that leads to events where the ground has to be sold for best price to secured creditors. "It all points to one thing. Rugby stops and the ground stops." Newport RFC chairman Will Godfrey said the WRU's offer of £3.75m for the ground reflected its value as a sports ground. "The problem you have got is that you either treat it as a development site or a sporting venue," he said. "There is limited demand for a sporting venue so when we established the value we consider that to be a fair price for a sporting venue. "Some of the facilities here are pretty old and people coming are going to look at them and say is a further investment going to bring back a return?" Major benefactor Brown said in his letter to shareholders he had initially invested £4m into Newport Rugby Club after his association started in 1997 which was turned into shares and written off when he initially left the board. After returning to the board, Brown claims he and Martyn Hazell put in an extra £5.5m to 'keep the Newport Gwent Dragons and Newport afloat.' He said the deal on offer was "the product of two years of many challenging board meetings and difficult decisions being taken to evolve it to this point, once we accepted that the current business model was not working and would ultimately fail. "Both Martyn and myself are over 80 and anxious to cut back on our responsibilities. "Before doing so, we have explored multiple options while trying to ensure a successful Dragons, a secure Newport RFC, protection of the venue and the continuation of professional rugby in Gwent at Rodney Parade. "The WRU became our preferred option rather than a choice of last resort, and I believe they are doing this with the best of intentions. "They are best placed to make a success of the Dragons, and ensure rugby for all continues at Rodney Parade."	The Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) takeover of Newport Gwent Dragons will be put to the vote on Tuesday, 9 May.
The former Oceana nightclub building will be demolished in October and replaced with a new office block. It forms part of the council's plans to transform the Kingsway into a business district. The authority is moving from its seafront location as part of a wider regeneration of the city centre. Work is due to start in 2017. The current civic centre site is likely to be replaced with public spaces, tourist attractions and homes. Swansea council bought the Oceana building - which was once at the heart of the city's nightlife - in May and it is understood it has been earmarked as the potential new home for the civic centre and central library. Demolition is due to take until March. "Once we have control of that site we will look at the development and possibly start construction in 2016 to build offices which could be home for the council offices and Swansea library," said Swansea council leader Rob Stewart. The building, originally constructed by the Rank Organisation in 1967 for a cinema, has accommodated a number of nightclubs over the years, including Ritzy and Icon, Time and Envy, and most recently, Oceana. It also previously housed an Odeon cinema and Tesco before they were turned into a different club and bar respectively. But it is no longer fit for purpose and a council move is one of a number of options being considered for the site.	The site which used to house Swansea's biggest nightclub could become the new home for Swansea council and library.
Laurence Shahlaei, originally from Cheltenham, took the title in Leeds from two-time title holder Hafthor Bjornsson who is also famed for his role in the popular television series. Mr Shahlaei, nicknamed "Big Loz", said: "He's a great strongman but it was my day and it felt really good to win." The 32-year-old is the first Englishman to win the title in 27 years. Standing at 6ft 2in (1.9m) and weighing 22 stone (145 kg), the Wiltshire-based athlete had to overcome injury last weekend to take the crown. "I've had a rough few years with injuries and to come back and win Europe's Strongest man has just meant the world to me," he said. "There's five different events that you have to do. I did a 420 kilo dead lift, which was good enough for joint second and then we did a frame carry - it's a race and you're running a 20-metre course while carrying 450 kilos, which is close to 90 stone, and I won that event." Competitors also had to lift a 177kg (28 stone) block above their heads "as many times as possible" as well as tackling the infamous Atlas stones - an event synonymous with strongman competitions. But it was running 20m (65ft) with a Volkswagen Beetle on his shoulders in around 11 seconds that clinched the title from Iceland's Hafthor Bjornsson. "My favourite of the competition was the car walk.  Imagine Fred Flintstone running in his car - that was basically me," he said. "I actually broke the world record on that event.  They made the car even heavier this year and I managed over a second off my world record - which was really, really good."

The union is supporting a campaign to stop Bangor University student Shiromini Satkunarajah being deported to Sri Lanka. The 20-year-old has been taken to a detention centre after being refused asylum. The Home Office said it considers each case carefully. Miss Satkunarajah, who was born in Sri Lanka but has lived in the UK for eight years, is due to finish her electrical engineering degree this summer. She was arrested on Tuesday and taken to a detention centre to await deportation on 28 February. Thousands of people have signed a petition to stop her deportation. NUS Wales deputy president Carmen Smith told BBC Wales: "We want the home secretary to stop the callous and inhumane deportation of Shiromini. "She doesn't have any family or friends in Sri Lanka. Wales is her home. "She has three months left of her degree. It's a brutal thing to do at such a time in her educational experience." Arfon MP Hywel Williams said the UK government should use "common sense" in dealing with Miss Satkunarajah's case. "She has three months to go before she graduates in a field where we really do need people and she's an excellent student," he said. "There is a certain amount of discretion they can operate and I really wish they would." A Home Office spokeswoman said: "We do not routinely comment on individual cases. "The UK has a proud history of granting asylum to those who genuinely need it and every case is carefully considered on its individual merits."	Any student seeking asylum should be able to finish their education here, the National Union of Students (NUS) Wales has said.
The Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) said he had been told not to report for training with the rest of the players on Monday. It is seeking clarification about an incident outside a fast food restaurant in the early hours of Tuesday. Police attended and said a man was taken away by officers but no arrests were made. The WRU said while the player, aged 28, was on an agreed holiday period from pre-Rugby World Cup training it operated a strict code of conduct covering behaviour both on and off the field. WRU group chief executive Roger Lewis said: "The player has been suspended due to a clear breach of the standards which we expect to be maintained by someone involved in one of our national squads. "Discipline and acceptable behaviour are issues which run to the core values of the Welsh Rugby Union and we cannot tolerate any compromise of those standards. "Mike Phillips is an exceptional player, but there is irrefutable evidence ... that he was engaged in behaviour which falls below the standards we set. "It is vitally important that we send out a clear and unambiguous message to one and all concerning our views on matters of this sort. "That message must be heard clearly by all players, coaches, administrators, volunteers, supporters and, of course, the parents and guardians of any child attracted to take part in the national sport of Wales. "Our senior national squad players are highly visible because of the profile which accompanies the success of our national sport and it is made clear to them that they are the ambassadors we rely on to foster and sustain our image." The incident occurred outside a McDonald's restaurant in Queen Street. Footage taken by bystanders shows Phillips being restrained by police before being led away in handcuffs to a police van. South Wales Police say he was not arrested. The player was recently released by the Ospreys regional rugby team after securing a move to French club Bayonne. The WRU said the suspension has been approved by Wales head coach Warren Gatland and agreed by the senior squad management team. Wales team manager Alan Phillips said: "We have suspended Mike Phillips on the clear evidence of a level of behaviour we regard as unacceptable. "It is clear there has been a breach of our disciplinary standards." Cardiff Blues scrum-half Lloyd Williams has been called into the Wales Rugby World Cup training squad as a replacement and will report for duty on Monday.	Scrum-half Mike Phillips has been suspended indefinitely from Wales squad duties after a late night incident in Cardiff.
The authorities say they want to check whether the organisations are operating legally - particularly whether they comply with a controversial law requiring all NGOs receiving overseas funding to register as "foreign agents". But human rights watchdog Agora says at least 90 NGOs have used its hotline since last week to complain about visits by officials from the prosecutor-general's office, the justice ministry and the tax authorities. Foreign NGOs - such as Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and Transparency International - have been among those targeted. Marina Gridneva, from the prosecutor-general's office, said the checks were being conducted "in strict compliance with the current legislation". Russian officials typically arrive unannounced, or at short notice, and request groups to hand over legal and financial documents, eyewitnesses say. Yelena Panfilova, who heads Transparency International's office in Moscow, said she was surprised that it was being checked again - just a month after a similar inspection. Law enforcement agents visited her office on Wednesday and gave her 24 hours to hand over paperwork. Ms Panfilova's links the checks with the new NGO legislation. "We are on the list of NGOs that are visible and presumably receive foreign funding. As far as I understand, there is a big search for 'foreign agents' among the NGOs," she told the BBC. When the controversial law on NGOs was approved in November, a number of prominent Russian groups said they would not comply - even if that risked closure. They regard the term "foreign agents" as insulting, saying it harks back to Stalin-era purges. Memorial, an NGO gathering information about victims of Communism, reiterated this position earlier this week when law enforcement agents turned up at its office. "Memorialâ€¦ has carried out a research of people who 70 years ago were called agents by the authorities and then shot. For us, taking on the label of a foreign agent is unacceptable", Memorial's Alexander Cherkasov told Reuters news agency. The "foreign agent" bill was one of several controversial laws adopted in the aftermath of last year's pro-democracy protests in Moscow. Other measures introduced tougher internet restrictions, outlawed "gay propaganda" and banned adoptions of Russian orphans by US parents. "The scale of these inspections serves to reinforce the menacing atmosphere for civil society created by the adoption of last year's laws," Human Rights Watch's Rachel Denber told Reuters. The group's Moscow bureau was inspected last Thursday. Several NGOs, including Transparency International, reported that the visiting officials were also looking into the organisations' compliance with anti-extremist legislation. Russia's law gives an extremely vague definition of extremism, allowing officials much leeway in choosing their targets.	Russian officials speak of "unplanned inspections" - but human rights advocates call the recent raids on dozens of NGOs a campaign of intimidation.
It condemned "the misogynist, hateful comments" it said had been made by Mr Trump about women and minorities. It follows the release of a 2005 video last week in which Mr Trump makes remarks about groping women. Mr Trump has apologised for remarks, which he described as as "locker-room talk". He has also denied touching women inappropriately. The motion was filed by Greens party MP Jeremy Buckingham to the Upper House of the NSW parliament. It said: "This house... agrees with those who have described Mr Trump as a 'revolting slug'." "It's clear that all reasonable and decent people find Donald Trump's behaviour obnoxious and that the world is hoping American voters reject his politics of hate," Mr Buckingham said in a statement. Because there was no objection, the motion was recorded as having been agreed to by all of the lawmakers. It was allowed only after the president of the legislative council determined that "revolting slug" did not amount to unparliamentary language. Parliamentary procedure prevents MPs from using "extremely distasteful" words. Who is ahead in the polls? 48% Hillary Clinton 44% Donald Trump Last updated October 10, 2016 Australians on social media were critical of the politicians with James Elliot Watson saying on Facebook: "I don't think it's wise for governments to condemn a bloke who they might have to work with as a world leader in future." "What a spectacular waste of time. Glad to see the House discussing the real hot button issues as they relate to NSW," said David Kelley. Others pointed out that Australian politics had its own share of problems. "Why bother for a revolting slug overseas, try looking at our own backyard. Plenty of slugs in Australia," said Bradley Patterson. "Australian politicians need to keep their mouth shut. They are no better because really that is all they are. And slugs is quite generous to describe them," said Katherine Fav. Mr Buckingham has developed a reputation for publicity stunts both inside and outside parliament. He previously 'vaped' an e-cigarette in parliament and set a river in Queensland on fire. Many top Republicans, including House Speaker Paul Ryan, have distanced themselves in recent days from the businessman-turned-politician Mr Trump. How does the US election work?

Riham Dawabsha suffered severe burns to 90% of her body in the July attack, blamed on Israeli settlers. Ali, her 18-month-old son, died during the attack while her husband, Saad, succumbed to his injuries a week later. The deaths provoked international condemnation. So far no suspects have been arrested. The Dawabsha family's home was one of two houses in the village of Duma set on fire and daubed with slogans in Hebrew, including the word "revenge". Another son remains in hospital. Riham's body is expected to be returned from the Israeli hospital where she was being treated to the Palestinian authorities in the occupied West Bank. Palestinians have accused Jewish settlers of carrying out the attack; Israel has not said whether it holds settlers responsible, and an investigation is ongoing. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has called the attack an act of terrorism and has said every effort will be made to catch the culprits After the attack, the Israeli government announced new measures to combat vigilante Jewish groups who attack Palestinians and their property, including administrative detention for extremists. A number of detentions have been made but none in direct connection with the firebombing in Duma.	A Palestinian woman has died of injuries she sustained during an arson attack on her home in the West Bank that killed her husband and infant son.
Well perhaps it is. It certainly took the commodities markets (and me) rather by surprise when it agreed to cut production at a meeting in Algiers. In fact the group has a lot of work to do before it has a real and sustained impact on the price. But that decision was not what the market expected. Traders thought the result would be more disarray, as there was at a meeting of Opec and some other oil exporters in Doha back in April. This time they did manage to make progress. The context for the Algiers decision - and the unsuccessful attempts to agree action before - is crude oil prices are less than half what they were in June 2014. That hurts Opec member countries. Government finances and economic performance have taken a substantial hit. In Saudi Arabia for example, the government's finances were in surplus to the tune of 12% of annual income (GDP) in 2012. Last year there was a deficit of 16%. Angola's economy grew 7% in 2013. Last year it was 3%. Venezuela's figures are much worse, though it's far from being entirely due to the lower price of oil. That has however severely aggravated the economic damage done by the country's political crisis. Opec member countries have felt this financial pain with increasing intensity for almost two years now. Opec doesn't account for the whole market by a long way. There are very large oil producers that are not members, notably the United States, Russia, China and Canada.  But the group, which currently has about 40% of the global market can move it by cutting production - and it does have a history of responding to low oil prices, by cutting production. In the past Saudi Arabia, the group's biggest player, has often led the effort. This time the situation was complicated by Iran's emergence earlier this year from international sanctions over its nuclear programme. Tehran was determined to take advantage and sought to recover its share of the market. For Opec, the trouble was that Saudi Arabia was unwilling to curb production without Iran doing likewise, a position also underpinned by the longstanding geopolitical tension between the two countries which are the leading powers in the Gulf. That tension was the reason for the failure in Doha in April. Things seem to have changed. Iran has boosted oil production already. It could go higher, but not as easily as was the case in the immediate aftermath of the lifting of sanctions.  Saudi Arabia has softened its position. The oil minister Khalid al-Falih, who was appointed after the Doha meeting, is reported to have said in Algiers that Iran, as well Nigeria and Libya would be allowed to produce "at maximum levels that make sense". The secretary general of the group, Mohammad Sanusi Barkindo, told the BBC that those three countries "have lost a considerable volume of their production due to unfortunate circumstances". He said "they will be treated differently." It also appeared to be the case for some time after the price fall began in 2014 that Saudi Arabia was willing to tolerate the situation because of the pressure it put on competitors, especially shale oil producers in the United States. The rise of this sector over the last decade or so is seen as a key factor behind the plentiful supply of oil that partly drove the price fall. Some shale operators have cut back, but overall oil production in the US in 2015 was higher despite the lower prices.  If the Saudi aim was to squeeze the American industry, they have not had anything like the success they hoped for. It does look as though the Saudis have decided they need a new strategy. So Opec agrees they want to take action to push prices up. The detail will be difficult to negotiate. How will they allocate the production cuts between members? How differently will Iran, Nigeria and Libya be treated? And what baseline level of production will they use in calculating new production ceilings? It's also likely they will want some non-members to co-operate. The US and Canada won't. They don't believe in the kind of market management that Opec is trying to achieve and in any case oil production is done in those countries by private businesses which will not take orders from energy ministers. Russia, however, might be willing to come on board and did discuss the possibility at the Doha meeting. And then with Opec there is always the question of whether member countries will comply with any agreed limits on their own production. The reaction of the oil market to the Algiers agreement is telling. The price of crude oil rose and then fell back. It remains very much within the range that it has been trading in for the last six months.  In short it looks like the market view is that something has changed at Opec, but traders will need to see Opec filling in all the details of an agreement before they are convinced that prices really are heading upwards.	Opec, the oil producers' group is back in the driving seat.
Transport Minister Humza Yousaf said a  new charter arrangement would end the long-running row over seafarers' pay. The RMT union had claimed some workers on board two freight boats were paid less than Â£4 an hour. The charter change will see contracted out services return to operator Serco Northlink from next month. The freight vessels Hellier and Hildasay have been operated by Seatruck, which is contracted to run the service by Serco Northlink. Seatruck argued the national minimum wage was not applicable to the crew, many of whom are non-UK residents. Serco Northlink said it had repeatedly offered to bridge the pay gap and backdate it, but Seatruck declined to accept. Mr Yousaf said the new arrangements would come into force early next month subject to some financial and regulatory details being finalised. He said: "I'm very pleased to see an agreement in principle now in place to end this long running issue around the freight vessels serving the Northern Isles. "The new charter basis will allow the wage issue to be resolved. Going forward, I can confirm that all crew members will be paid at least the minimum wage." Serco Northlink was awarded the six-year Â£243m Northern Isles contract in 2012. It operates three ferries and two cargo boats to the Northern Isles on a route which is heavily subsidised by the Scottish government.	An agreement has been reached to ensure foreign workers on freight boats serving Orkney and Shetland are paid at least the minimum wage.
It is one of a number of measures being considered by the government in its consultation on curbing corporate pay. Other proposals include improving the effectiveness of remuneration committees and votes on pay packages. It comes after Theresa May appeared to row back from plans to force companies to appoint employees to their boards. The government's green paper, published this week, aims to increase public trust in business in the face of the rise in anti-globalisation and anti-business sentiment. Its proposals will include: As part of the plan to reform remuneration committees, the government is considering whether employees' representatives should be given an advisory role. Officials believe their input would spell out to the committee the impact on the wider workforce of high levels of remuneration for top executives. In September trade union body the TUC said its research showed the average FTSE 100 boss was paid 123 times the average full-time salary, and that the median pay award of major FTSE 100 directors had risen by 47% in five years to 2015 to Â£3.4m. As part of the proposed shake-up, civil servants have looked at measures being taken in other countries including the US, France and Australia. A government source said: "Businesses are a pillar of our society, creating employment opportunities and contributing significantly to funding our country's public services. "The UK has led the world in corporate governance, but our strong reputation can only be maintained if government and business regularly reviews and upgrades our governance. "Good governance helps companies take better decisions, for their own long-term benefit and the economy overall - ensuring public trust in British business and making sure the UK is the best place in the world to do business." The publication of the green paper comes after Mrs May was forced to reject claims she had watered down plans for workers to have a say in how their companies are run. She ruled out imposing the appointment of employees to company boards when she gave a talk to the CBI this week. Days later the the Bank of England's chief economist, Andy Haldane, joined company chiefs to reject proposals for annual binding votes on pay and the publication of pay ratios. The two ideas were among the prime minister's suggestions to address public unease about executive pay. A report by the Big Innovation Centre think tank argued that a binding vote would mean Britain's top firms losing out on top talent. It also said that pay ratios do not "lend themselves to valid comparisons between companies" and would likely add to misunderstanding over executive pay as well as potentially creating "perverse incentives". Instead, the report argued for less complex pay structures, a "Fair Pay Charter" and giving shareholders more say on executive pay.	Britain's largest companies will have to reveal the pay gap between their CEOs and average workers, under new government proposals.
He also said the summer transfer window would have been "significantly important for many reasons". The Spaniard was sacked on Thursday with Everton 12th in the Premier League following a 3-0 defeat by Sunderland. He added: "It has been an honour to be the manager of Everton Football Club for the past three seasons." Everton reached the semi-final of both the FA Cup and League Cup this season but have only won five home league games and will finish with their lowest points tally at Goodison Park since the introduction of three points for a win in 1981. Martinez, 42, took over at Everton in 2013, finishing fifth in his first season but slipping to 11th last term. He added: "I will treasure this period as Everton manager forever - the memories of reaching a club record 72 points tally in the Premier League, reaching the final 16 of the Europa League and the excitement of reaching the semi-finals of both domestic cups this season. "I express my gratitude to chairman Bill Kenwright, who understood and supported my vision and who gave me the privilege of becoming an Evertonian." Martinez offered his "sincere thanks" to the players and staff at the club. He added: "I appreciate that over the last eight weeks our league results haven't been up to the levels that we would expect. However, over the past three years the support the fans have given to me and the team has been inspiring. "I know that the team and the fans will react well against Norwich today and I wish everyone the best of luck for three points which would match last season's league points tally." Everton host Norwich in their final Premier League of the season on Sunday with current under-21s coach David Unsworth and former manager Joe Royle taking charge. Martinez also praised American keeper Tim Howard, who is making his final appearance for the club before heading to Major League Soccer's Colorado Rapids, for his "outstanding contribution" to the club.	Roberto Martinez said he is "disappointed" Everton were not able to "finish what we started" following his sacking as manager this week.
The French manager has yet to say whether he will sign a new contract to stay beyond this season, but believes the spirit he has created in 20 years at the club can live on without him. "It's more natural for local players because they have been educated in Arsenal - players like Ramsey, Chamberlain," Wenger said. "They have to take charge." He added: "They should lead and take responsibility to say 'yes, that is how we want to behave, this is how we want to play, let's go together'. "If they didn't want it, that would be a huge disappointment." Sunday's FA Cup semi-final against Manchester City (kick-off 15:00 BST), which could be Wenger's last trip to Wembley Stadium, is also his 11th semi-final as Arsenal manager. It is the Gunners' last chance of a trophy this season. Wenger could field as many as five British players - Aaron Ramsey, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Theo Walcott, Kieran Gibbs and Rob Holding - but he says a player's nationality is less important to him than "players who integrate the values of the club" and are "ready to defend these values". "A lot is said about my future but my future is more important in the value and spirit of what we have built in 20 years than my own person," added the 67-year-old Frenchman. In the opposite dugout, Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola has happy memories of Wembley as both a player and a manager with Barcelona. The Spaniard was a member of the Barca side who won the European Cup at the ground in 1992 and he was manager when the side beat Manchester United 3-1 in the Champions League final in 2011. Guardiola said: "Wembley in my life has been so important in terms of football. We were able to win the first Champions League when Ronald Koeman made a fantastic goal against the Sampdoria of Roberto Mancini. "The second one, we beat one of the best teams in the world in Manchester United at Wembley and, especially the way we played, always I will remember in my heart. "Wembley is an important part of my life. Going back there will always be special."	Arsene Wenger has challenged Arsenal's British players to take responsibility for the club's future.

Donald Trump, Jeb Bush and Scott Walker will take the stage in Cleveland on Thursday night with seven rivals. Fox News selected the 10 most popular Republicans based on five national polls, excluding Mr Perry and South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham. Those two and five other candidates will take part in an earlier debate. Former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum reacted angrily to his omission. "The idea that they have left out the runner-up for the 2012 nomination [Santorum], the former four-term governor of Texas [Perry], the governor of Louisiana [Bobby Jindal], the first female Fortune 50 CEO [Carly Fiorina], and the 3-term Senator from South Carolina [Graham] due to polling seven months before a single vote is cast is preposterous," his spokesman said. In contrast, Mr Perry tweeted that he was looking forward to being on Fox at 5pm for "a serious exchange of ideas and positive solutions to get America back on track". The main debate takes place four hours later at 9pm local time (01:00 GMT). All eyes will be on hotel tycoon Mr Trump, who leads the polls and has made headlines with outspoken remarks about many of his rivals.

Thomas Sargent was on his Yamaha Fazer motorbike on Bolton Road, Withnell, on Sunday afternoon when he was involved in a collision with a Volvo car. He was airlifted to the Royal Preston Hospital, where he later died. His family described him as a "quiet, enthusiastic, caring and loving man" with a "real passion for motorcycles". Paying tribute, they said: "He had just celebrated his 21st birthday by touring Europe on his Yamaha motorbike. "He died doing something he loved and is now at peace and resting with his Grandma. He will be dearly missed by everybody that knew him and will never be forgotten." Police are urging witnesses of the collision to get in touch.	A man killed in a crash in Chorley had recently returned from a motorbike tour of Europe as part of his 21st birthday celebrations.
Chris Packham, who is in Malta, said rare species were being targeted, and hunters were even shooting Montagu's harrier birds on the ground at night. "It's a desperate situation," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. A Maltese wildlife official insisted that patrols to stop illegal hunting had been stepped up. Malta has an exemption from the EU Birds Directive, allowing its hunters to shoot turtle doves and quail during the spring migration, a crucial stage in the birds' life cycle. But according to Mr Packham, turtle doves were vulnerable, with their numbers down by 95% in the UK. Malta is the only EU country to have a recreational spring hunting season allowing birds to be shot. Mr Packham, a presenter of TV documentaries on wildlife, said Maltese hunters were ignoring restrictions under the exemption, or "derogation" in EU jargon. He said they were killing many other birds which are supposed to be protected. He is in Malta with the conservation group Birdlife Malta to draw attention to the annual spring shoot, which has been criticised by environmentalists for years. "Yesterday I'm afraid to say I had a dead swift in my hand that had been illegally shot and also a dead little bittern," Mr Packham told Today. Sergei Golovkin, head of Malta's Wild Birds Regulation Unit, insisted that the authorities were controlling the hunters. He said enforcement of the restrictions had "improved dramatically in the last few years". Malta has "the highest ratio in Europe" of enforcement staff deployed against illegal hunting, he told Today. Thirty-three MEPs have jointly lobbied the European Commission to put pressure on Malta over the hunting exemption. A British Liberal Democrat MEP, Catherine Bearder, says the EU must "stop Malta from breaking EU rules, by systematically failing to apply the derogation correctly".	A leading British naturalist has accused the Maltese authorities of failing to prevent large-scale illegal shooting of migratory birds by hunters.
Details of the amount paid by the consortium and the total stake acquired have not been disclosed. The takeover ends Italian businessman Francesco Becchetti's troubled three-year stay as O's owner. The club recently staved off a winding-up petition at the High Court, having paid off debts to four creditors. Following the dismissal of the winding-up petition, representatives of the Leyton Orient Fans' Trust (LOFT) had urged Becchetti to sell the club "urgently to any new responsible owner". In a statement on the Orient website, Becchetti said the club had been sold without any "debts to the bank" and "without arrears for taxes". "Over the last two years, I have, unfortunately, not been able to dedicate myself to following the club as closely as I would have wanted," he continued. "This is clearly the moment to leave the club to others and I know that in doing so I am leaving it in good hands with Nigel Travis." Travis, who describes himself as a "lifelong" O's fan, has been appointed as chairman of the club. A second investor, Kent Teague, has been named as a director, while a fan representative will also be appointed to the board. Local businessman Marshall Taylor has been appointed interim chief executive, while former Orient owner Barry Hearn will retain ownership of the club's stadium at Brisbane Road. "Barry and I actually went to school together," Travis told BBC Radio London. "Barry did a great job previously [as owner]. We're going to take some lessons from what he did and bring in some new stuff, but he remains the owner of the stadium and that's the way it's going to stay." Travis has taken over the club in a personal capacity, with Dunkin' Brands, the parent company of Dunkin' Donuts and Baskin Robbins, not involved in the deal. Leyton Orient had been beaten in the League One play-off final less than two months before Becchetti purchased the club in July 2015, but last season their 112-year stay in the English Football League came to an end with relegation from League Two. The club had 11 managers or head coaches under Becchetti's ownership, including five different bosses last season alone. They have been reported to have only 15 senior players under contract for next season, with the oldest of those players being 20-year-old Charlie Grainger. Manager Omer Riza is only under contract until 30 June, with the club's first pre-season game scheduled for 12 July. "We're going to make an announcement on the football side tomorrow [Friday]," said Travis. "They will be the two key appointments. The idea is the board doesn't get involved in the day-to-day things."	A consortium led by Baskin Robbins and Dunkin' Donuts chief executive Nigel Travis has completed its takeover of Leyton Orient.
Highways England plans to "increase capacity and reduce congestion" between Worthing and Lancing. But Adur and Worthing councils say the Â£69m proposal is not fit for purpose and the government body should launch a fresh consultation with updated plans. Highways England project manager Tom Beasley said the improvements were the "best achievable option". Large-scale options were considered by Highways England, including dual carriageway schemes with flyovers. But the consultation focuses a mix of new traffic signalling and road widening on six junctions between Durrington Hill and the Lancing Manor roundabout. In a joint statement, the leader of Adur District Council, Neil Parkin, and the leader of Worthing Borough Council, Dan Humphreys, said the "modest" plans are not good enough. Mr Parkin said: "Highways England say they want to consult with us but we say this is a sham. By not allowing the public to weigh up options and see full costings how are we to make any kind of decision? "All I do know is the current scheme on the table is barely worth the disruption and certainly not worth spending Â£69m on." Mr Humphreys added: "Highways England do not seem to be taking us seriously. Our questions were met with an 'experts know best' response." But Mr Beasley said Highways England think that the proposal "would make a worthwhile improvement to people's journeys and is the best achievable option within the scope and budget available for the project". "We welcome all views and promise that we will take all responses to the consultation fully into account." Consultation into the proposal ends on 12 September.	A consultation into improvements on the A27 has been dubbed "a sham" by council leaders.
Workie, as the animal is called, will star in a TV advertising campaign that starts on Wednesday evening. Since 2012, 5.4 million workers have been signed up to a workplace pension, under the auto-enrolment programme. But millions more people who work for small businesses, or individuals, have yet to be offered a pension plan. All employers are being warned that they need to offer pensions to anyone who is over the age of 22 and who earns more than Â£10,000 a year. That includes, for example, nannies, care workers, plumbers and bar staff. The pensions minister, Baroness Altmann, was said to be "personally involved" in designing Workie. A spokesperson for The Pensions Regulator said Workie was the embodiment of something you cannot ignore.	A ten foot tall hairy monster - reminiscent of Sweetums in The Muppets - is to be used to persuade more employers to set up a pension scheme.
Michelle Davies from law firm Eversheds echoed concerns of employers' group, the CBI that the UK government decision to cut subsidies for renewables will damage investment and jobs. She said the Welsh government missed the boat by not doing enough when subsidies were in place. Both government rejected the criticism. The UK government cut subsidies because it is already meeting its renewable energy targets, but Ms Davies told BBC Radio Wales that was "not a sensible decision" because it made the UK a less attractive place to invest. Ms Davies said Wales was not near where it should be on renewables, particularly when compared to Scotland's "strong leadership position". "We didn't create that environment initially and we're paying the price for it now," she told the Wales at Work programme. "Unfortunately there isn't a huge amount we can do about that now because the [UK] government sets the level of support that is provided," she said. A Welsh government spokesman said it did not have the same energy powers as Scotland, and defended its green energy record. The UK government said its priority was to move towards a low-carbon economy and ensure subsidies were used where they were needed most.	One of the leading lawyers in the renewable power sector has criticised the UK and Welsh governments for their approaches to green energy.
The Vikings led the table after winning six of their first seven games but slipped from the top after losing to Warrington on 25 March. Betts' side currently lie in fifth place in the table and face league leaders Warrington again on Friday. "I don't see our form being that bad, we've just lost some games," Betts told BBC Radio Merseyside. "We've lost some momentum to look at the table, but internally we're still doing some good things." After conceding 108 points in their opening seven matches, Widnes' fortunes have changed of late, with the Vikings conceding 103 points in their last four games. "It's about doing the little things well, keeping the confidence high and doing the things we did at the beginning of the year with the same kind of determination," he added. "We know we've got to get moving back in the league but Warrington are saying the same thing and there are guys who are fighting to get some momentum in their league positions."	Head coach Denis Betts is not worried about Widnes' recent form despite four consecutive Super League defeats.
German state prosecutors said they had found the man's number on the phone of Anis Amri, who killed 12 people by ramming a lorry into market shoppers. Amri was shot dead by police in Milan early last Friday, four days on from the attack. The 24-year-old Tunisian had opened fire, wounding one. Amri had links to known Islamists. German prosecutors say a video in which Amri pledges allegiance to so-called Islamic State (IS) is genuine. Government officials have said the lorry's automatic braking system may have prevented the loss of more lives on 19 December. The system kicks in when it senses an impact and this may have cut the hijacker's rampage short. Frauke Koehler, spokesperson for the federal prosecutor's office, said "further investigations revealed that the detained man was not a contact person of Anis Amri's, therefore he had to be released". She said the pistol found on Amri when he was shot dead by Italian police last week had the same calibre as the one that killed the Polish driver whose truck Amri hijacked. Lukasz Urban, 37, was killed by a gunshot to the head - apparently before the lorry was driven into the Christmas crowd at Breitscheidplatz, in central Berlin. His body was found in the cabin, after Amri had fled. Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni told a news conference there was no evidence that Amri had any "particular networks" in Italy. He was probably radicalised after arriving in Italy in 2011, Mr Gentiloni said. Investigators are trying to piece together Amri's movements after the Berlin attack, when he was subject to a European arrest warrant. There are indications that he travelled to Nijmegen in the Netherlands on 21 December and then took an overnight bus from Amsterdam to Lyon in France. Then he took a train to Chambery in the French Alps, changed trains, and reached Milan. He was stopped by police in the early hours of 23 December near Milan's Sesto San Giovanni station.	German police have released a 40-year-old Tunisian man who had been a suspected accomplice of the Berlin Christmas market assailant.
Toulon's Halfpenny, 26, ruptured anterior cruciate knee ligaments during Wales' 23-19 win over Italy at the Millennium Stadium on Saturday. Scrum-half Rhys Webb, also 26, suffered an ankle injury in the match, but there is no news yet on the extent of the damage. Halfpenny's likely replacement at full-back, Liam Williams, has not played since having foot surgery in June. The other two full-backs in Wales' 31-man squad - Bristol's Matthew Morgan and Dragons' Hallam Amos - have six caps between them. Halfpenny has scored 508 points in 62 appearances for Wales. The Welsh Rugby Union has not said who will replace Halfpenny. Wales start their World Cup campaign against Uruguay in Cardiff on 20 September, before playing co-hosts England, Fiji and Australia their remaining Pool A matches. Former Wales Shane Williams has questioned coach Warren Gatland's decision to select Halfpenny against Italy. Halfpenny started the game with strapping on his right leg, suggesting he was already carrying an injury. Record Wales try-scorer Williams said the victory over Italy was "just horrendous for Wales". "Webb has been the form player for Wales and to lose Halfpenny as well, it's just a massive blow," he said. "You kind of thought 'do we need Halfpenny on the field? Let's wrap him up in cotton wool and roll him out when we really need him'. "Wales is in mourning already. Especially with Halfpenny, he was strapped up on his leg anyway."

Norwegian researchers report that the sea ice is becoming significantly thinner and more vulnerable. Last month, the annual thaw of the region's floating ice reached the lowest level since satellite monitoring began, more than 30 years ago. It is thought the scale of the decline may even affect Europe's weather. The melt is set to continue for at least another week - the peak is usually reached in mid-September - while temperatures here remain above freezing. The Norwegian Polar Institute (NPI) is at the forefront of Arctic research and its international director, Kim Holmen, told the BBC that the speed of the melting was faster than expected. "It is a greater change than we could even imagine 20 years ago, even 10 years ago," Dr Holmen said. "And it has taken us by surprise and we must adjust our understanding of the system and we must adjust our science and we must adjust our feelings for the nature around us." The institute has been deploying its icebreaker, Lance, to research conditions between Svalbard and Greenland - the main route through which ice flows out of the Arctic Ocean. During a visit to the port, one of the scientists involved, Dr Edmond Hansen, told me he was "amazed" at the size and speed of this year's melt. "As a scientist, I know that this is unprecedented in at least as much as 1,500 years. It is truly amazing - it is a huge dramatic change in the system," Dr Hansen said. "This is not some short-lived phenomenon - this is an ongoing trend. You lose more and more ice and it is accelerating - you can just look at the graphs, the observations, and you can see what's happening." I interviewed Dr Hansen while the Lance was docked at Norway's Arctic research station at Ny-Alesund on Svalbard. Key data on the ice comes from satellites but also from measurements made by a range of different techniques - a mix of old and new technology harnessed to help answer the key environmental questions of our age. The Norwegians send teams out on to the floating ice to drill holes into it and extract cores to determine the ice's origin. And since the early 90s they have installed specialist buoys, tethered to the seabed, which use sonar to provide a near-constant stream of data about the ice above. An electro-magnetic device known as an EM-Bird has also been flown, suspended beneath a helicopter, in long sweeps over the ice. The torpedo-shaped instrument gathers data about the difference between the level of the seawater beneath the ice and the surface of the ice itself. By flying transects over the ice, a picture of its thickness emerges. The latest data is still being processed but one of the institute's sea ice specialists, Dr Sebastian Gerland, said that though conditions vary year by year a pattern is clear. "In the region where we work we can see a general trend to thinner ice - in the Fram Strait and at some coastal stations." Where the ice vanishes entirely, the surface loses its usual highly reflective whiteness - which sends most solar radiation back into space - and is replaced by darker waters instead which absorb more heat. According to Dr Gerland, additional warming can take place even if ice remains in a far thinner state. "It means there is more light penetrating through the ice - that depends to a high degree on the snow cover but once it has melted the light can get through," Dr Gerland said. "If the ice is thinner there is more light penetrating and that light can heat the water." The most cautious forecasts say that the Arctic might become ice-free in the summer by the 2080s or 2090s. But recently many estimates for that scenario have been brought forward. Early research investigating the implications suggests that a massive reduction in sea ice is likely to have an impact on the path of the jet stream, the high-altitude wind that guides weather systems, including storms. The course and speed of the jet stream is governed by the difference in temperature between the Tropics and the Arctic, so a change on the scale being observed now could be felt across Europe and beyond. Kim Holmen of the NPI explained how the connection might work. "When the Arctic is ice free, it is not white any more and it will absorb more sunlight and that change will influence wind systems and where the precipitation comes. "For northern Europe it could mean much more precipitation, while southern Europe will become drier so there are large scale shifts across the entire continent." That assessment is mirrored by work at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasting, based in the British town of Reading. The centre's director-general, Alan Thorpe, said the link between the Arctic melt and European weather was complicated but it is now the subject of research. "Where Arctic sea ice is reducing in summer - and if we have warmer than average sea surface temperatures in the north-west Atlantic - these twin factors together lead to storms being steered over the UK in summer which is not the normal situation and leads to our poorer summers." But the research is in its earliest stages. For science, the Arctic itself is hard to decipher. The effects of its rapid melt are even tougher. You can see David's coverage from the Arctic on BBC News on Friday - on television, on radio and online.  Photographs by Mark Georgiou	Scientists in the Arctic are warning that this summer's record-breaking melt is part of an accelerating trend with profound implications.
North Wales Police added that from those tests, 60 arrests were made. It follows a report earlier in December which said motorists are more likely to be tested for drink driving in north Wales than anywhere else in the UK. Det Ch Con Gareth Pritchard warned motorists not to be tempted to drink and drive. He said: "Officers will continue to carry out breath tests across north Wales as part of our campaign to reduce deaths on the roads."	More than 13,000 people have been tested for drink and drug driving in north Wales the run up to Christmas, police said.
Media playback is not supported on this device The wing, 34, scored in the last move of Wales' 24-18 defeat by Australia in Cardiff and was later in tears during a televised interview. Gatland said that the last-gasp try "was fantastic for him [Williams]". The New Zealander also says Wales' fans can look forward with excitement to the 2012 Six Nations and beyond. "You've got to be excited about the Six Nations. I thought it was a really good game of rugby," said Gatland. "And I thought we played some great rugby in that first half against one of the best defences in world rugby. Media playback is not supported on this device "They had the best defence at the World Cup - they were hard to break down. "We scored a couple of cracking tries and you've got to be excited about the youth in this team. "Jamie Roberts, now that Shane Williams is gone, is the oldest in that backline at 25 years of age. "There's a good young loose-forward trio, some second-rows are still very young so we've got to be really excited about not just the up-coming Six Nations, but the next cycle and looking forward to building up to 2015." Gatland felt that Leigh Halfpenny's 50th-minute sin-binning was "unlucky" and that Australia fully exploited Wales' disadvantage while the full-back was absent. "I felt sorry for Leigh because with the angle he came from and the way the ball bounced he thought it had gone in to [Australia fly-half James] O'Connor's hands and he has not been able to see the ball, but he thought he had the ball at the time," Gatland said. "The referee has a different angle and we accept that decision, but unfortunately we conceded 21 points in that period and that's the game. "We got ourselves back into the game, but that 10 minutes has been very costly for us." However, Gatland felt Osprey Williams can look back on a memorable send-off to an outstanding career. He [Shane Williams] is a once-in-a-generation player Gatland said: "The game didn't go fantastic for him outside of that [try], but it was a fitting end for someone who's had a fantastic career. "He's won a lot of games from his individual exploits for Wales over the years so to score in the final minute of his final game was a fitting end, I think." Australia coach Robbie Deans also paid tribute to Williams. "He is a once-in-a-generation player," said former All Black Deans, echoing the thoughts of rugby figures such as Barry John, Graham Henry and Bryan Habana. "What he has achieved in the game no one does really. He deserves every acknowledgement going. "It was a nice way to finish, although I probably wasn't excited at the time until I saw who it was. "He is a quality player and we wish him well. He has contributed to the game of rugby. "He leaves a legacy a lot of players in Welsh rugby will want to follow. It's good for the game."

The BBC revealed in January it understood Adidas would terminate the deal as a direct result of the doping scandal sweeping the sport. An IAAF statement on Friday said: "Our commercial relationship concludes at the end of 2016." The original 11-year agreement started in 2008. Sources told the BBC earlier this year it was worth, in terms of cash and product, as much as about $8m (£6.3m) per year. Adidas said the decision was mutual and added "we would like to thank the IAAF for a successful and professional co-operation".	Adidas, the IAAF's biggest sponsor, has announced it is ending its sponsorship deal with athletics' world governing body three years early.
The 27-year-old Frenchman played 29 times for Leyton Orient in 2016-17, as they were relegated from League Two. He was out of contract, having joined the O's from Portsmouth on an 18-month deal in January 2016. Atangana made his name in England with Havant and Waterlooville, winning their player of the year in his solitary season at Westleigh Park before joining Pompey in 2014. He is the third close-season signing made by Cheltenham boss Gary Johnson - who himself signed a new contract on Friday - after Yeovil midfielder Kevin Dawson and Dover defender Jamie Grimes.

The 27-year-old was caught on camera apparently swearing at Murray's semi-final opponent Tomas Berdych's team. Murray had defended Sears, saying: "In the heat of the moment, you can say stuff that you regret." But Sears made light of the issue for the final against Novak Djokovic.	Andy Murray's fiancee Kim Sears laughed off the controversy over her colourful language in Melbourne by wearing a 'Parental Advisory: Explicit Content' T-shirt to the Australian Open final.
Exports of the fish jumped more than 53% by value to £408m, the Food and Drink Federation (FDF) said. UK food and drink exports rose 8.5% to £10.2bn, helped by the fall in the pound after last year's Brexit vote. But the FDF warned that without a favourable Brexit trade deal, British exports could become less competitive. Whisky remained the top export, while salmon was second, and beer rose to third, overtaking chocolate. But while the volume of salmon exports rose by 24%, whisky exports actually fell 1% by volume, and beer exports fell 2.2%. The pound has fallen sharply against the dollar and euro since the UK voted to leave the EU in June last year, giving a boost to UK exports, as they have become relatively cheaper. However, the weaker pound has also pushed up costs for British businesses that bring in food and raw materials from abroad, the FDF said. It said the UK's food and drink trade deficit - the difference between how much the UK imports and exports - widened 16% to £12.4bn over the period. British salmon is becoming more popular globally, according to Andy Bing, sales director of Loch Duart Salmon in North West Scotland. "This half we've sold more than we ever have," he said, adding that the firm's main export markets were France, the US, Italy, and Switzerland. UK salmon exports have grown after Chilean producers suffered problems in 2015 with algal blooms that killed a large amount of their fish, he said. Looking ahead, the firm is optimistic about the eventual post-Brexit trade deals that can be struck with EU countries. "Europe needs lovely Scottish salmon just as we need lovely French wine and wonderful German cars," he said. However, he added that Loch Duart was "finding it difficult to plan without better guidance" from the government about Brexit. The two biggest importers of UK food and drink are Ireland and France. If there is no deal and World Trade Organization (WTO) tariffs with the EU are brought in, "food and drink would face significantly higher tariffs than most other products," an FDF spokesman said. For example, some fruit and vegetables would face tariffs of 157%, and for some drinks products, importers would have to pay 152% tariffs. Goods "could face lengthy delays at border for checks and inspections that would add delays and cost to products, particularly those with short shelf lives," the spokesman added. However, the free market think tank, the Institute for Economic Affairs, said it would not be a "disaster" if the UK failed to strike a deal with the EU. Jamie Whyte, IEA research director, said: "In fact, we could unilaterally eliminate all import tariffs, which would give us most of the benefits of trade and export to the EU under the umbrella of the WTO rules." A UK government spokesman said it wanted to reach a deal with the EU "allowing for the most frictionless trade including in food and drink as possible". Source HM Customs and Excise In the first half of the year, UK food and drink exports rose faster to EU countries, up 9%, than to countries outside the EU, with growth of 7.6%. But the market which saw the most growth in the first half was South Korea, up 77%, in the main due to beer exports. Food Minister George Eustice said: "We have ambitious plans to produce and export more of our fabulous foods around the world and more businesses are trying exporting for the first time. "Last week we announced further market access to China for pork producers and UK beef will soon be heading to the Philippines. We will continue to work with industry to open new opportunities."	Sales of British salmon helped the UK to export a record value of food and drink in the first half of the year, according to industry figures.
Opener Stuart Thompson hit 56 while Gary Wilson (41 no) and captain William Porterfield (39) added valuable runs as Ireland made 165-5 in Greater Noida. It was not enough with Samiullah Shenwari (56) and Mohammad Shahzad (47) helping the Afghans to 171-4 with two overs to spare. The sides meet again in the second T20 at the same venue on Friday. Ireland suffered an early blow when opener Paul Stirling was dismissed for a duck and with just one run on the board. Thompson and Porterfield steadied the innings before Wilson helped the Irish to a competitive total. Shahzad and Najeeb Tarakai (27) put on an opening stand of 51 as Afghanistan cruised to their victory target. Afghan spinner Amir Hamza (2-23) was the only bowler to take more than one wicket on a day when the bat dominated. "We fell a little bit short of potentially a very big score. We could have added another 15 and gotten up to the 180 we were looking for," said Porterfield. "As well as we played I thought we just came up short with the ball. We didn't quite execute things as well as we would have liked." The loss of paceman Boyd Rankin for the T20s, because of a back problem, was another setback for the Irish on Wednesday. Rankin is expected to return for the five ODIs against Afghanistan, starting on 15 March.	Ireland started the three-match T20 series against Afghanistan with a six-wicket defeat in India on Wednesday.
The 30-year-old defender has made 200 appearances for the Rams since joining from Coventry City in 2012. A Republic of Ireland international, Keogh made two appearances at Euro 2016 as Ireland reached the knockout stages. "He's an important player, on and off the pitch, so it's great news that he has committed his future for the next three years." boss Nigel Pearson said.	Derby County captain Richard Keogh has signed a new three-year deal, keeping him with the club until summer 2019.
Revenues rose 18% to £1.55bn last year, with underlying operating profit jumping 44% to £330m. But after the costs of last year's merger between Paddy Power and Betfair were taken into account the company reported a loss of £5.7m. Analysts at Liberum said the company's performance in the final quarter of 2016 had been "disappointing". "It seems likely that operational challenges will continue around the performance of cross-sell to sports customers and the investment required to stimulate growth," Liberum said in a research note. Overall, the FTSE 100 closed lower, having traded higher for much of the sessions, losing 10.75 points, or 0.15% at 7,339.37. "Markets remain becalmed for yet another day, hampered by a lack of data and a general wariness ahead of the ECB [European Central Bank] on Thursday, NFPs [US employment figures] on Friday and a Fed meeting next week," said Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG. Shares in Direct Line fell 2.9% after the insurer reported a fall in full-year profits due to changes in the way that compensation payments are to be calculated. Pre-tax profits fell 30% to £353m, with changes to the payment formula cutting profits by £217m. In the FTSE 250, shares in Aggreko sank 11% after the temporary power provider said it expected profits to fall this year. On the currency markets, the pound fell 0.29% against the US dollar to $1.2203 and was also 0.27% lower  against the euro at 1.1535 euros.

"I can't wait to play this week," he enthused to the assembled journalists. "I've been looking forward to this for a long time, probably four or five years to be honest." So have we Russell. It's exciting, even for battle weary Scottish journalists, to see someone performing at the top of their game on a world stage with the potential to go further. That's not beyond Knox and the next two weeks provide the perfect platform for him to deliver further on his potential and achieve many of his dreams. Victory at the this week's Scottish Open in his home town of Inverness would certainly be one. That would push him right up the list for Ryder Cup qualification. Then there's the matter of next week's Open at Troon. Currently 27th in the world rankings, 131 places above the nearest Scot, Richie Ramsay, Knox is Scotland's best hope to at least fight for these trophies. He is a contender in most tournaments these days, primarily on the PGA Tour, and for a place in Darren Clarke's Ryder Cup team. As his star rises, Knox remains adamant that playing in front of an expectant home crowd over the next two weeks won't be a hindrance, despite heightened expectation. His demeanour backs that up. He seems philosophical - what will be, will be. "It adds a little bit of pressure," he said. "We're used to it, every week you've got pressure. I put a lot of pressure on myself every time I play so I don't really feel added pressure. "I've been wanting to do this my whole life. I've been wanting to play on the PGA tour, European Tour, all the majors and hey, it's starting to happen. "I've been wanting to win tournaments, be in the top 20, 10 in the world, see how high I can get. "This is what I've been dreaming my whole life. I'm not sure if you're ever really ready for it but you've just got to do your best and go for it." There's a wider goal for Knox than doing well in his home country, or even achieving a dream Ryder Cup place. Getting into the top 20 or 30 players in the world is tremendously hard. Staying there is just as difficult, if not more challenging, and plenty of players have been there and fallen away. "Of course the goal is to stay inside the top 50 but you have to play well to do that," said Knox. "It's so hard to stay there. To be honest I don't know how I'm going to do. I could quite easily move forward or quite easily move back. "That's the hard thing about golf. It's such a hard game. One week you feel like you can hit any shot, then up comes a week like last week when you're like 'Am I even good enough to play golf?' I feel like I can keep improving." Luke Donald addressed us shortly before Knox's arrival. He won this tournament at Castle Stuart in a rain-shortened Scottish Open in 2011, when he was the top-ranked golfer on the planet. He is now 83rd in the world and struggles to get anywhere near the form he showed so consistently. "Luke is a great player, and he's just one example of someone who has been at the top and slipped down," said Knox. "He's still a great player. "It's so hard to stay there and this is really my first go at trying to stay there and trying to move up." Such awareness can only be a positive for Knox and perhaps helps to keep his head on the ground despite his success. "The whole journey's been crazy the last couple of years. I just hope I never wake up and it keeps going." Victory here at home could be the launchpad for his life to get even crazier.	Russell Knox has every right to beam from ear to ear, as he did for the majority of his 15-minute media gathering, after flying in from his base in the United States to a sodden Castle Stuart.
They show Balachandran Prabhakaran, son of rebel leader Velupillai Prabhakaran, eating chocolate on a bench. Campaigning group Journalists for Democracy in Sri Lanka says they are proof the boy was summarily executed. A military spokesman denied the allegations. He said they were based on "lies, half-truths and rumours". JDS says analysis of the photographs' metadata shows they were taken by the same camera at 10:14 and 12:01 on 19 May 2009 - on the final day of Sri Lankan forces' bitter 26-year war against the Tigers. Velupillai Prabhakaran died at around the same time in a stretch of land between the Nanthikadal lagoon and the sea, where hundreds of thousands of civilians were trapped in the last bloody months of the conflict. The army said he was killed in battle but human rights groups said he might have been killed after surrendering. British film-maker Callum Macrae says the photographs of Balachandran Prabhakaran - which show the young boy first alert and unharmed and in the custody of soldiers but then dead, shot five times in the chest - rules out the government's assertion that Balachandran was killed in crossfire. "His death was deliberate and calculated. This is a proof, beyond reasonable doubt, of the execution of a child - not a battlefield death," said Mr Macrae. "The pictures fill in chilling details on the circumstances of his murder - and leave the Sri Lankan government with yet more questions to answer." But army spokesman Ruwan Wanigasuriya said the photos showed "no substantive evidence", and were being released in Mr Macrae's latest documentary, No Fire Zone (NFZ), that is timed to coincide with a session of the UN Human Rights Council next month. In the past two years, Mr Macrae has made films for the British TV station, Channel 4, using video evidence to allege that the government side committed serious war crimes as it defeated the Tamil Tiger militants in 2009 - allegations always denied by Colombo. The new film is set to be screened at the Geneva Human Rights Film Festival during a UN Human Rights Council meeting next month. Meanwhile 133 Sri Lankan Christian clergy, mostly from the former war zone, have signed a letter urging the UN Human Rights Council to pass a strong resolution that is critical of Colombo and will set up an international inquiry into all alleged war crimes. The mainly Tamil churchmen and women say that today the ethnic minority's culture, religions, language and land are being suppressed with what they say is "an intent to destroy us in whole or part".	Photographs have emerged which are said to show the 12-year-old son of a Tamil rebel leader alive and well in custody less than two hours before he was shot dead.
AB InBev on Wednesday raised its offer for SAB to £42.15 a share, having previously bid £38 and £40. SABMiller closed up 2.4% at £37.08, having risen sharply since InBev first made its move last month. Any deal between the two would create the world's biggest brewer, worth more than £180bn. SABMiller said its board had formally considered the new offer, and had "unanimously rejected the proposal as it still very substantially undervalues SABMiller, its unique and unmatched footprint, and its standalone prospects". AB InBev brews Budweiser, Stella Artois and Corona, while SAB brews Peroni and Grolsch, among others. If a deal does go through, the merged company would produce one-third of the world's beer. On Tuesday, SAB reported a 9% fall in revenues for the three months to September, which it blamed on weakening emerging market currencies. Sales volumes were up 2%. Shares in AB InBev closed up 0.6% in Brussels at €98.65.	SABMiller has rejected an improved offer from Anheuser-Busch InBev that it says "very substantially undervalues" the company.
The cels, from the 1937 release Snow White and the Seven Dwarves, were brought along to a valuation day in Leicestershire. One image depicts the moment the Wicked Queen hands Snow White the poisoned apple. Auctioneer Charles Hanson said that one alone sold for £10,500. The other, depicting Snow White with animals, was sold for £5,600 when it went under the hammer in Etwall, Derbyshire. Mr Hanson said the cels were sold on the internet to the same buyer. "We had bids from all over the world: America, Italy... the theatre and drama in the saleroom felt like a magical movie moment," he said. Snow White was released in 1937 and was briefly the highest grossing film of all time, before being overtaken by Gone with the Wind.

Charles Hanson, from Hansons Auctioneers and Valuers, said: "Snow White and the Seven Dwarves by Walt Disney is a film that has provided so much joy to so many people over the generations. "Such familiar and famous characters are right here at the very beginning of this success. "Of all the scenes that could be captured on a cel the famous poisoned apple takes some beating - it's the very heartbeat of the film."	A pair of original pieces of cine reel from Walt Disney's first animated feature-length film has sold for more than £16,000 at auction.
Many more found their lives were transformed forever by the natural disaster. Here, some share their stories. Louis Cryer was 18 and in Sri Lanka with his mother Zoe and brother Felix We were staying in an idyllic beach village called Unawatuna in Galle district. It took a matter of seconds for a wall of water of about 5ft (1.52m) in height to start coming in. It was a kind of surge which reached the first floor of our hotel. Zoe Cryer, Louis' mother, Sri Lanka Survival instincts totally kick in. I thought our balcony might collapse. My main worry was for my 13-year-old who wasn't such a strong swimmer. We grabbed what we could and got out as quickly as possible. My youngest son, Felix, had been studying tsunamis in geography. He was the first one to realise what had happened. He saw the islands disappearing. When we returned, all the buildings in front of the guest house had been pulled away. A crowd gathered around a woman who had collapsed. I'm qualified in first aid so went to help. We tried to give mouth to mouth, but she died. I'd never seen a dead body before. Many tourists had the opportunity to fly out immediately but I felt strongly that we needed to make our peace with what had happened - with the country and with the people. We were supposed to travel to southern India but went home instead. I didn't think it was right to be there. It was a while before I could look at the sea and feel comfortable. It flattened walls, trees, and the buildings around us, before rising higher and higher. We tried to get people out. Miraculously, guests who had been in the room underneath us started popping up from the water. One woman was trapped in her locked room because she couldn't find her key. She said the room filled up quickly with water and she took what she thought would be her last breath. Luckily she found the key and opened the door which then burst into pieces under the pressure. Buildings were collapsing around us. We tried to pull out passing people trapped in the currents. When the water finally subsided we made a run for higher ground and a temple that had become a make-shift safe refugee area. We set up camp in a hotel up on a hill and when it was safe to do so, we went back down to salvage anything we could. I remember seeing rooms full of mud and fish. People came up to the temple with dead bodies. We carried one Italian woman with a suspected broken back through the debris to another hotel to get medical help. I met one guy who had been out surfing and was swept a few miles up the coast. He had to walk through all the death and destruction to find his family. Luckily he found them all. One of the only positives to come out of it all was the humanity of it. It didn't matter about your nationality or religion. Everyone was checking on each other. A few days later, once the road was clear, the High Commission sent coaches to take us back to a refugee centre in Colombo. We were fed, watered, offered clothes and flights home but we chose not go straight away. We wanted to stay to try and comprehend the reality of what had happened. The main thing we felt was guilt. After seeing the devastation, we were lucky enough leave, but many were left with nothing. Once in the UK, I put on an exhibition of photos I'd taken, spoke about it at our school and raised Â£3500 to send back to the village. I gained a new-found respect for the sea. I never realised its power. It hasn't put me off going in the water, but I'm a lot more aware of what it can do. We were having breakfast at the hotel on a terrace, overlooking the pool, the beach and the Andaman Sea. My husband Tom noticed the waiters were all pointing at the sea which was receding rapidly. It was a fascinating sight. People got their cameras out and walked towards the dry seabed. The beach was full of sunbathing tourists. Tom had an uncomfortable feeling though. He lived for two years on the beach in California and had never seen a sea behave like this. Then it clicked: the trembling he heard earlier was an earthquake. The receding water was the prelude to a tidal wave. Tom grabbed my hand and screamed, "Run!". At that same moment, he saw a high wall of water come crashing over the reef towards us at a speed of 40-50mph. We ran uphill fast. The water was right behind us. The noise was deafening. Tom looked behind and saw the beach and pool area were a boiling mass of water. Palm trees, beach chairs and parts of bungalows were twirling around and people were frantically trying to hold on to something. We kept going for higher ground, up the steep hill into the jungle beyond it. We waited for two hours, knowing only few people would have survived the onslaught below. When the sea looked calm again we descended to the hotel, and found many badly wounded people. We helped to get them onto the back of trucks taking people to hospital. Then we were warned another tsunami was on its way so we climbed up into the jungle again, where we waited three more hours. We then came down to the road there were cars and trucks loaded with the wounded. No one knew what to do or where to go. We did not want to go down to the lower level and see all the corpses that littered the beach. There was no electricity, no cell-phone network nor radio, so we spent the night at a small restaurant stand. The next day the road was clear, and we could start the long trip home. The floor of the bus station was covered with wounded people, all waiting for the bus to Bangkok. People nearly cried at the opportunity to use our cell phone and reach their families to tell them they were alive. The guilt was hard to bear. I will never forgive myself for not going to the hospital with the wounded but mainly for coming back unscratched. Ten years on and we are still looking at life with a lot of more appreciation. We feel connected with Thailand so that is why we continue with a Thai animal charity. My partner and I had won a snorkling trip at a raffle on Christmas Eve at our hotel, Phi Phi Charlie on Koh Phi Phi. That raffle saved our lives. We had been snorkelling in the water when the Thai guides started to call everyone back onto the boats. The water had receded rapidly from the shoreline and nobody knew what was happening. We were lucky that we managed to get back onto the boat as the waves came in, and the boat swiftly repositioned itself some few hundred metres away from the coast. However, as strange currents began to develop and the waves started to impact upon the bay, we saw people being swept away. Longtail boats that had been closer to the shoreline snapped and sank like twigs. We can't believe how lucky we were to get back onto the boat as we don't know what happened to the people we had been snorkelling with and who had been swept away. We just thought some localised freak incident had taken place but 30 minutes later the boat guides had a phone call from friends who told them Phuket and Phi Phi Don had been hit badly by a tsunami. It became clear that Koh Phi Phi, where we had been staying, was devastated by the waves. Our hotel was destroyed, and it was only recently we found out that over half the people staying there were killed. We stayed in open water for the rest of the day waiting for more advice about what to do. It wasn't until late afternoon that the boat took us back to Koh Phi Phi Don. It was then that the tragedy became apparent. We were sailing in a soup of debris from the island which included TVs, fridges, holiday books and worse. It was just awful. We could see that the island was devastated and the infrastructure was shattered. One man on board had a mobile phone. We all took it in turns to try to call home. Eventually I got through to my brother-in-law. I have never heard anyone speak with such worry and relief. He told me that everyone was so worried and had feared the worst. We all decided to stay on the boat that night, moored out at sea. The boat was too small to have taken us all the way to Phuket. The only option we had was to wait for help to arrive in the morning. It was the longest night of my life and were it not for the camaraderie of those passengers on board and the wonderful generosity of the Thai people who owned and manned the boat, it would have been unbearable. As the sun rose, we took the boat in to the harbour once again and waited for the larger boats to arrive. It was just awful. From our position on the water we saw hundreds of people all desperate to get off the island. They were huddled together on the pier in the harbour. We eventually got the ferry boat to Phuket that morning and after a long wait we boarded an army plane back to Bangkok and a flight home. We had lost all of our possessions but didn't care, we were so grateful to be alive. It was such an awful situation and such a random tragedy. Why did we take that boat trip that day? What if we had overslept? Why should we be the ones to survive and not so many others like us who didn't. It is senseless and random and just so utterly sad. Every 26 December since the tsunami my partner and I take a walk on a beach and reflect on that devastating day. We will remember those who died again this year. Produced by Sherie Ryder and Helen Dafedjaiye	On 26 December 2004, a 9.1-magnitude earthquake off the coast of Banda Aceh, Indonesia, triggered a deadly tsunami that killed more than 230,000 people and rendered millions homeless.
They will be able to end tenancies, sometimes without a court order, when asylum requests fail, ministers say. Landlords will also be required to check a migrant's status in advance of agreeing a lease. Repeat offenders could face up to five years in prison. But critics have said it may lead to UK citizens being refused accommodation. The proposals - to be included in the upcoming Immigration Bill - come as the British and French governments struggle to deal with a migrant crisis in Calais, where large numbers of people are making nightly bids to cross the Channel to reach the UK. Under the proposals for landlords in England, the Home Office would issue a notice when an asylum application fails that confirms the tenant no longer has the right to rent property. Analysis by legal correspondent Clive Coleman It is currently a criminal offence to remove tenants without a court order. Obtaining that order enables bailiffs to evict tenants. That all takes time. The new measure may cut out court orders, but it is unclear: This will trigger a power for landlords to end the tenancy, without a court order in some circumstances. Landlords will also be required to carry out "right to rent" checks on each tenant's immigration status before allowing them to move in, expanding a pilot that has been running for a year in the west Midlands. Repeatedly failing to do either would be a new offence carrying maximum penalties of five years' imprisonment or a fine. A blacklist of "rogue" landlords and letting agents will allow councils to keep track of those who have been convicted of housing offences and ban them from renting out properties if they are repeat offenders. Communities Secretary Greg Clark acknowledged that cases in which tenants refused to move out would still end up in court but that the process would be quicker because landlords would have official "evidence" to present to the courts of their tenant's status. "You have saved the landlord having to spend money establishing something that is clear and that the Home Office can provide - which is a clear statement of whether they should be there or not," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Asked whether evicting migrants simply increased the risk of people disappearing altogether, unless immediately detained by the police, Mr Clark said the initiative was part of a "joined-up system to send people home". Analysis, by Alicia McCarthy The streets of the UK are not paved with gold. That's the clear message the government wants to send to those tempted to come to Britain illegally. Ministers say the tightening of the demands on private landlords in England is simply the enactment of a manifesto promise to make them carry out the same checks as employers and that migrants need to know there is no right to work or rent a home if you are in the UK illegally. It's not clear yet how the scheme will work or what impact it will have other than moving illegal immigrants from where they are living. And some may suspect the timing of the announcement is a response to the nightly television news pictures showing scores of desperate migrants trying to cross the channel - and to criticism from some that ministers have failed to get a grip on the situation swiftly enough. For Labour, shadow immigration minister David Hanson said he backed tougher checks but said ministers appeared to be "offloading" the problem on to landlords and it was up to the authorities to decide whether people should be allowed to remain or deported. Since August 2014, private landlords in five councils - Dudley, Sandwell, Wolverhampton, Walsall and Birmingham - have been required to conduct checks to establish new tenants have the right to rent in the UK or face face a penalty of up to £3,000. Mr Clark said the pilot - introduced as part of the 2014 Immigration Act - had been a success and would be extended across more of the UK, although he could not say how many people had been deported as a direct result. But the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants said the pilot - which has yet to be officially evaluated - had serious shortcomings. "We have heard that British people with foreign accents are finding it difficult to get tenancies from some of the, you might say, unscrupulous landlords," its chief executive Habib Rahman told Radio 4's World at One. And David Smith, from the Residential Landlords Association, said there was evidence of "document discrimination" with some landlords reluctant to rent their properties to anyone who could not produce a valid passport.	Landlords in England will be expected to evict tenants who lose the right to live in the UK  under new measures to clamp down on illegal immigration.
Ms Suu Kyi failed to persuade the military to allow a clause barring her from the presidency to be overruled. Under the clause she cannot be leader as her sons are British, not Burmese. But she has vowed to lead from the sidelines instead. The candidate thought most likely to become president, Htin Kyaw, is a close aide. The NLD, which won a landslide in November, has named Htin Kyaw as its lower house nominee for vice president, and Henry Van Thio, an MP from the Chin ethnic minority, as its upper house nominee. Both houses will choose between the NLD's candidates and those from other parties, but because the NLD holds a majority in both houses, its candidates are likely to be chosen. The winner from each house will then enter a second vote to decide the president of the country. A military nominated candidate will also compete in this vote. The two losing candidates will become vice-presidents. It is not clear when the votes will take place. Correspondents say Htin Kyaw is almost certain to be elected president by the NLD-controlled parliament. Read more: Aung San Suu Kyi - Power not presidency in Myanmar She tried right to the last. But there was no deal. Despite a huge win in the election, Aung San Suu Kyi failed to convince the army that her destiny was the presidency. Clause 59F of the constitution which bars her because her sons have British not Burmese passports remains in place, and she has now chosen someone else. It's Htin Kyaw, who she's known all her life. He's a committed member of the party and was by her side when Ms Suu Kyi was released from house arrest in 2010. His most important quality may be the ability to take orders. Aung San Suu Kyi has made it clear that though she does not have the title - she will still be in charge. The NLD won the majority of non-military seats available in parliament in last year's historic general election, although the army - which still controls a quarter of all parliamentary seats and key security ministries - remains a significant force in Burmese politics. The new government will take power on 1 April - the first freely elected government after more than 50 years of military rule and then five years of military-backed civilian government.	Myanmar's National League for Democracy (NLD) has named its candidates to be president, confirming that its leader Aung San Suu Kyi is not a contender.
On Sunday, the Revolutionary Guard in Tehran held a funeral for two of its men killed in action in Syria, the latest of dozens in recent weeks. Revolutionary Guard commanders say they are defending their own country by fighting in Syria against the kind of terrorism that may eventually reach the streets of Tehran. Iran's support for the beleaguered Syrian President, Bashar al-Assad, has been costly in both blood and treasure. So when the invitation came from the US to join a push for establishing a new political process with the aim of ending the war in Syria, Iran was happy to accept. The invitation to Iran, which until recently was regarded by the US and its allies as part of the problem in Syria, could not have come without the nuclear deal reached in July. Nearly two years of direct nuclear talks led to an understanding that there were regional issues both nations had a strong interest in resolving. A telephone call from US President Barack Obama to King Salman succeeded in persuading Saudi Arabia to drop its objection to Iran's participation - for now. On Friday, for the first time in four and a half years of civil war in Syria, many of the main actors were at the table. EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini called it a historic meeting. Tehran's involvement in the talks on Syria alarmed Iranian hardliners. They fear the nuclear agreement may have opened the floodgates to undesirable Western influences, and they see Iran's participation in the talks as another worrying sign President Hassan Rouhani is deviating from the Islamic revolutionary path. It comes only weeks after the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, himself a hardliner, had declared there would be no negotiations with the US on any issue. Furthermore, the hardliners discovered to their consternation the Syria talks involving top Western powers, Russia, China, Syria's neighbours, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Egypt had made modest progress. All participants, including Iran, agreed to push forward with a political process that would: For Iran's hardliners, even this most general outline of a possible political process is a step too far. They criticised Foreign Minister Zarif for giving too much away and accused him of forgetting about what they regard as the central issue - the need to fight armed groups the West portrays as moderate forces. "We did not sell out the political future of Syria at the talks," countered Hossein Amir-Abdolahian, Deputy Foreign Minister, who is Iran's point man on regional policies. What the negotiators agreed to disagree on in Vienna, however, was the position of President Assad. Some wanted him gone soon after a ceasefire, but Iran is adamant he should stay until elections at the end of any transitional process. "It's the people of Syria who can decide on this," said Mr Zarif. Iraq and Syria are Iran's only allies in the Arab world. Syria provides Iran with vital access to southern Lebanon, where Iran is deeply committed to the Shia population and Hezbollah. Iran's policy of ensuring the survival of President Assad has many critics at home in Tehran who argue his position is no longer tenable after he has been responsible for so much bloodshed. New talks on Syria between the world powers are due in two weeks. But in spite of the uneasiness at home, Tehran is not about to abandon President Assad, because it fears any new regime in Syria may not be as accommodating to Iran. In Iran's calculation, it is vital that its ally Russia continues to back President Assad. So as long as Russia remains on side, the Iranian hardliners need not worry about a change in direction from Tehran. That is why many around the table in Vienna suspected Iran of engaging in the talks in order to find a solution that saves Mr Assad. Where key players stand on Assad If not Assad, then who? Iran's growing role	Coffins are being flown back to Tehran from Syria at an alarming rate.
Fire Brigades Union (FBU) members walked out at 18:00 GMT on Friday and are due back on 4 November. Some fire brigades have warned the public could be left "vulnerable" and small fires may not be attended. Fire Minister Penny Mordaunt said fire and rescue authorities have "robust" plans in place for the weekend. Union officials say that under the government's proposals firefighters will have to work until they are 60 instead of 55, pay more into their pensions and get less in retirement. The proposals will leave firefighters at risk of dismissal as their fitness declines into their 50s, the FBU said. FBU members went on strike in England and Wales in August over the same dispute. Strike action due to take place in Wales has been averted after a "significant" change of direction by the Welsh government, the FBU said. General secretary Matt Wrack accused the Westminster government of "sickening hypocrisy". "The real scandal is that their own pensions are by far the most generous anywhere in the public sector," he said. One firefighter and his son carved pumpkins together and tweeted a photo in support of the strike. "It's an issue which affects both me and my family and I have explained the dispute to him," said the firefighter, who asked not to be named. The West Yorkshire brigade said the public would be left in a "vulnerable position" and asked people to take extra care this weekend. The London brigade said it may not attend rubbish or small grass fires or help anyone stuck in a lift. Industrial action over the past 18 months has seen fire authorities spend millions hiring contractors to cover for striking FBU members. The FBU said it expected about 36,000 firefighters to walk out. The fire minister said: "All fire and rescue authorities have robust and well-tested plans in place that include back-up support if needed. "Public safety is the primary focus and if anyone needs emergency assistance, they should dial 999." She said strike action was "unnecessary" after pension regulations laid in parliament on Tuesday mean nearly three quarters of firefighters will see no change in their pension age in 2015.	Firefighters across England are on a four-day strike in a row over pensions during one of the service's busiest weekends of the year.
Invisible Edinburgh said the aim was to reveal a different side to Scotland's capital city. The tours start in the Grassmarket, Castle Terrace and Middle Meadow Walk and each has a different theme and is tailored to the guide's individual experience. The venture has funding from the Edinburgh Airport Community Fund. The themes are powerful women of Edinburgh, crimes and punishment, community sport and food and charity. Zakia Moulaoui, 28, from France, set up the tours after getting the idea from a project in Greece where street vendors take people on walks. She told the BBC Scotland news website: "We have four guides at the moment but will be training up more in September. "There is a homeless point to all the walks, which is personal to the guide, so for example the crime and punishment tour will tell you about Burke and Hare but the guide will also tell you about his own relevant problems with the court across the road with funny stories. "The tours are a mix of old and new. "In the powerful women of Edinburgh you will hear about Maggie Dickson but then also about JK Rowling." The Â£8 tours run on a Saturday and tickets must be bought online.	Walking tours led by people who have been homeless have been launched in Edinburgh.
Princess Anne spoke to well-wishers outside the church after attending the service with her father Prince Philip, brother Prince Edward and other royals. Buckingham Palace said the Queen is "still recuperating" from a heavy cold. Missing church was a "precautionary measure" in cold and wet weather and there was "no sense of undue concern". Twelve days ago the palace said both the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh had heavy colds and had cancelled their plans to travel to Sandringham on 21 December. They left for their Christmas break a day late, travelling by helicopter instead of train. Prince Philip has since made a full recovery. The Queen did not attend  the Christmas Day service at her Norfolk estate, the first time she has missed the service in many years. The New Year's Day service at Sandringham was led by the Bishop of Norwich. Princess Anne's husband, Vice Admiral Sir Timothy Laurence, who accompanied her to the service, added that the Queen was feeling "not too bad". The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were also absent from the service, after they, Prince George and Princess Charlotte spent Christmas with Kate's family at Bucklebury in Berkshire. By Royal Correspondent Peter Hunt For a second time, during the holiday season, senior royals have attended church. For a second time, the Queen has been a notable absentee. Given her deep personal faith, it's a decision the Supreme Governor of the Church of England will not have taken lightly. But at 90 - and on the advice of her doctor - she is exercising caution as she recovers from a heavy cold which she's had for at least 12 days, and which is bound to have left her feeling pretty miserable. Officials insist the head of state is up and about; she has not been to hospital or had tests; and she continues to deal with the documents she receives in her government red box. As well as missing church, the under-the-weather monarch has become a voluntary prisoner inside her own Sandringham home. She hasn't yet had an opportunity to go outside and explore her 20,000 acre private Norfolk estate. Read more here.	The Queen is feeling "better" despite missing a New Year's Day church service at Sandringham, her daughter Princess Anne has said.

This is the full statement to the inquests read by his son, Stephen Clark, on behalf of his mother Jacqueline Gilchrist: Jacqueline Gilchrist speaking on behalf of the Clark family. Joseph Clark came from a large family. He had five brothers and one sister. He was the third eldest and always loved spending time with his extended family when he was growing up. 'Oey' was quite a shy lad who enjoyed playing football and going out with his mates and brothers. He was very close to his siblings, as well as his Mum and Dad. Profiles of all those who died He loved it when his extended family had large gatherings. He got to meet those relatives he hadn't seen for a while. Even his aunts and uncles loved him. Joseph, who was also known as Oey, played football for two local teams and was known for being a speedy winger. One of the teams he played for was the Woodpecker Bar FC.  People always commented on how good a player he was, even if he was just kicking a ball about with his mates. Oey and I met in 1978. I was 16 years old and Oey was 18. We lived around the corner from each other. 'Fell in love' We met in a club and from then fell in love. We loved each other to bits, and then, four and a half years after we met, we had our first son Joseph, who was born on 31 August, 1982. Sadly, we lost Joseph on 15 October when he was just six-and-a-half weeks old. Oey was heartbroken. Stephen was born two years later, on 22 March, 1984. Oey was over the moon and was so excited that he had a son. He nicknamed him BB. They were always playing football together and going on days out on boats up the Mersey. In 1989, we gave birth to a little girl Jennifer. She was tiny. Oey was scared to pick her up. The morning of 15 April, 1989, that horrible day, was one of the times that he did pick her up before he left the house. He had been playing football with Stephen outside while holding Jennifer in his arms and swinging her in the air. His mates arrived in the car to go to the match, so he gave us all a kiss and said 'See you later' and off he went. That was the last thing that he said to us because he never came back from the match. He was only 29 years old with his whole life in front of him. 'Happy-go-lucky' Oey was employed by IBL in Liverpool and enjoyed his time working there. We all miss Oey very, very much. Life has never been the same since he died that horrible day. Our whole lives changed and I never really got over it and we're in still life. I am still the same from that day. Oey would have been proud of his children now that they are grown up. Stephen remembers lots about him, going to matches with his father and enjoying the time  that they spent together. He loved Liverpool Football Club and I know that he was very proud to be able to take his own son to the matches at Anfield. Oey has three beautiful grandchildren, who he never had the chance to meet. The eldest, Joseph, was born on New Year's Eve ,2005. Lee was born in 2008 and his  grand-daughter, Daisy, was born on 27 July, 2012 but unfortunately Daisy only lived 12 days before she passed away. Joseph loved life to the full. He was always happy-go-lucky and forever with a smile on his face. He is missed by all of us who were lucky enough to have known him.	A father-of-two from Liverpool, Joseph Clark was a fork lift driver and drove to the match with his brother Stephen Clark and David Roberts, who both survived, and another friend, Alan McGlone, who also died in the tragedy.
The Real Madrid forward got the decisive goal when he stooped low to head in Miguel Veloso's superb cross. Up until then they were frustrated by a disciplined Sweden side, who went close through Johan Elmander, Sebastian Larsson and Kim Kallstrom. No player has scored more headed goals (four) than Ronaldo in European World Cup 2014 qualification The second leg will take place at Solna's Friends Arena on Tuesday. That promises to be another fascinating contest between two sides, with the impetus now on Sweden to attack, having set their stall out to defend for long periods during the first leg. They did, however, create the better chances in the opening 45 minutes despite Portugal enjoying 67% of the possession. With Paris St-Germain forward Zlatan Ibrahimovic given special attention by Portugal's defence, his attack-minded team-mates found themselves with more space than they should have been afforded. Norwich's on-loan forward Elmander was first to cause nerves in the home support when he stretched to send Mikael Lustig's right-wing cross inches past the post. Erik Hamren's men then created two great chances in the space of two minutes. Sunderland's Larsson surged forward from midfield to strike a low shot that Rui Patricio dived to his left to divert, before Kallstrom, winning his 107th cap, smashed an 18-yard free-kick that brushed Portugal's upright. Ibrahimovic failed to register a single touch in the opposite box against Portugal The home side's best chance of the half came in the first five minutes when Ronaldo and Raul Meireles combined before feeding Joao Moutinho, who drifted round keeper Andreas Isaksson before firing into the side-netting. Portugal's frustrations continued after the break as Sweden sat deeper, while their coach Paulo Bento probably would have been left exasperated by some of the awful attempted deliveries into the area. But with eight minutes left one cross led to something greater when Dynamo Kiev's Veloso's fantastic delivery found Ronaldo, who threw himself at the ball to give Portugal the lead. Moments later, the Real Madrid marksman almost scored his 30th of the season, but saw his header bounce back off the crossbar. Sweden offered little as an attacking threat after the break, with Ibrahimovic failing to trouble Patricio and his defence. The skipper will have to show the sort of form he has produced for Paris St-Germain this season on Tuesday if Sweden are to stand a chance of going to Brazil. "We would have been very happy with a draw," Sweden coach Erik Hamren said. "We played a good game defensively - the goal was unnecessary, we were careless with that cross." Bento added: "We created a great early chance and Sweden hit back. But in the second half it was one way for us. "It was an important step to reach the World Cup but not yet decisive."

Media playback is not supported on this device It was physical, it was abrasive, it was what they talked about all week and what new head coach Eddie Jones said he wanted to get England back to. Jones said he was going up to Murrayfield to set the tone and leave with the win. He will go away happy and we will see a progression on what they did against Scotland over the next few games. The tactics were more route one, using the forwards. Centre Jonathan Joseph didn't really get the ball and the wingers mainly got it from kick returns so there is still a bit of finesse for England to put around the back line. The stats showed that England's set-piece was very good. Captain Dylan Hartley's line-outs were brilliant (England only lost one of their 15) and they were clinical. Jones has said he wants a strong set-piece game and he wants a strong, abrasive pack. They delivered that against Scotland. England also probably had two clear-cut chances to score tries and they took both of them. From that side it is all positives but I think Joseph will want to be in the game more. Media playback is not supported on this device His centre partner Owen Farrell wasn't in the game that much either and full-back Mike Brown wasn't his usual self. That will come but it is just going to take a bit of time. I am not massively sold on the combination of Owen Farrell and George Ford at fly-half and inside centre. If you have two number 10s who are out-and-out number 10s then both of them are spending too much time organising the game rather than carrying the ball. Farrell only carried the ball three times against Scotland and Joseph four. The midfield is not really functioning properly if that is happening. But at the same time, they linked up beautifully to put Jack Nowell in for a try. I would prefer an out-and-out inside centre who can also be a ball player rather than a fly-half playing there. At the moment it is a stop gap for England. I would prefer someone with a little bit more individual threat who can also do the distributing. Someone who is saying, "I need to be in the game more". Sometimes Farrell is trying to plan what England do and plot them around the pitch. George Ford needs to be doing that. Henry Slade is your dream but he is injured. He would have been the answer without a question of a doubt. At the moment they are having to do what they can with limited resources. England edged the breakdown in terms of numbers and in terms of actual turnovers. There are a lot of people in the England pack that can make turnovers with Dan Cole, Chris Robshaw, Joe Launchbury, James Haskell, Billy Vunipola and Mako Vunipola off the bench. I do hope England don't come up against an out-and-out specialist open-side flanker and get done again. We are not going to see that probably until we go to play Australia in the summer but it will be interesting to see what England do in the meantime. We still need to develop an out-and-out number seven. It will strengthen our game but someone has got to play well enough to keep knocking on the door. I judge intensity on the speed of your ball coming out from rucks and how fast people are getting into position to carry again. Media playback is not supported on this device England completely outworked Scotland in that respect. I also judge intensity on what a side does in defence - in terms of line speed in getting up to make a tackle. In the first half England were a bit off it but in the second half they were outstanding. They really led the line and outworked Scotland. From that point of view I think Eddie will be very happy. The scorelines might be similar between England's first game under Stuart Lancaster at Murrayfield in 2012 (a 13-6 victory) and this weekend but England had a lot more control this weekend. At the same time it can't really be compared. Stuart was creating a brand new team. He got rid of all the old guys and brought in loads of youngsters. Jones' team knew each other very well. I would give it a solid six and a half out of 10. Maybe a seven. There is still a lot of work to be done but knowing Jones and the workaholic nature he has got, he'll think the same.	In terms of what England wanted out of the game with Scotland I think they got everything.
The plan, likely to come into force in 2017 and the first in the UK, has already divided opinion among health and medical groups, including some anti-smoking campaigners. But ministers say it is a "balance of risk" and will stop children smoking. Tattoo parlours will also need licences under the Public Health Bill. In taking the decision to bring in the e-cigarette ban, ministers have argued they did not want to take the risk of seeing smoking "normalised" again after the success of the smoking ban. The new tobacco and e-cigarette measures will mean: This final measure is proving the most controversial and is likely to come into force in 2017, but a precise date has not been given. Public Health Wales, local health boards and the BMA are in favour of the e-cigarettes curbs. But anti-smoking campaign group ASH Wales, Cancer Research UK and Tenovus are among those opposed and the British Heart Foundation, British Lung Foundation and Royal College of Physicians want more evidence. In a public consultation on the proposals last year, 79% of responses were opposed. 19% of adults in Wales smoke 16% target by 2020 70% of smokers want to quit 44% tried to quit in past year 2.6m British adults use e-cigarettes 61% of vapers want to quit smoking There have been concerns that it might make it more difficult for smokers using e-cigarettes as a way of stopping. George Butterworth, tobacco policy manager for Cancer Research UK, said there was no evidence of normalisation of e-cigarettes with young people - and those using them were "very, very small numbers". "Those that are, are the type of people who would try alcohol or tobacco cigarettes anyway - so without that evidence we wouldn't support a ban on the use of e-cigarettes indoors under the idea of normalisation," he said. "E-cigarettes are an opportunity for people to move away from tobacco smoking which is very, very bad for their health, and we wouldn't want to put up any barriers to prevent people from quitting cigarettes. " By Nick Triggle, health correspondent E-cigarettes have really divided health opinion - and that in turn has caused confusion. However, the arguments for and against them are in fact typical of many that have been heard down the years in the field of health. That is to say it is all about balancing risk and benefit - and as evidence is still emerging it is only natural to find a variety of opinion. On their own, there is little to recommend the use of e-cigarettes. They contain some toxins and, therefore, in theory are potentially harmful - both to those using them and, possibly, through passive smoking. But this debate is further complicated by the fact that it is not just the merits of e-cigarettes that are being discussed, but their impact on smoking tobacco products. Some, for example, have argued they act as a gateway to real smoking. But, of course, e-cigarettes cannot be seen in isolation. Smoking them - and this is about the only thing that is not disputed - is less harmful than tobacco products. That, in a nutshell, is why some claim they should be treated sympathetically. Officials acknowledge there is divided opinion but believe the evidence is now growing to support a ban. Although the numbers of children using e-cigarettes are low, ministers do not want to take the risk of children seeing smoking "normalised" again after the success in banning smoking. There are similar e-cigarette restrictions in countries like Belgium, Spain and Malta, with proposals in France and Ireland. But this would be a first for the UK. The BMA says it is "vital" that e-cigarettes do not undermine tobacco control and they are particularly worried that the way they are marketed is making them attractive to children. It also says more research is needed to find out whether e-cigarettes actually help smokers to quit. TATTOOS AND PIERCINGS A licensing system is also being drawn up with the tattoo and piercing industry - to produce enforceable professional hygiene and health standards  by 2017. There are already around 350 tattoo premises with licences in Wales but  there are many others, including self-taught tattooists called "scratchers". It is a recognition that times have changed dramatically since the last legislation in the early 1980s, with tattoos and piercings more popular. There will also be a ban on intimate piercings for the under-16s. Ministers say the industry welcomes the new system - backed up by the threat of prosecution and fines - which will see tattooists having to show they are competent. BETTER ACCESS TO TOILETS Councils will also be expected to produce a local toilets' strategy and to involve shops and other businesses in providing "creative solutions" to meet local needs. It recognises the budget constraints to councils and that it has become an issue of access to "toilets in public" rather than public toilets - those owned and run by local authorities. Health Minister Mark Drakeford said they wanted to get the balance right between all the things that would make a big difference to people's health  in the future "while not wanting to intrude on the legitimate rights people have to run their own lives." He added: "The Welsh government has a responsibility to create the conditions which enable people to live healthy lives and avoid preventable harm to their health." Attempts to bring in a minimum price for alcohol are still being worked on but will not be included in the bill until the outcome of a European Court of Justice hearing on similar legislation in Scotland. REACTION Shadow Conservative health minister Darren Millar AM said he feared some aspects of the bill interfered in individual rights. "E-cigarettes are a staging post for many smokers on the road to quitting and moves to restrict them will make it more difficult for smokers to kick the habit," he said. Plaid Cymru health spokeswoman Elin Jones said the assembly now needed to "consider all of the evidence that relates to the effect of e-cigarettes on public health, most of which is newly-emerging". "E-cigarettes are used widely by people who are trying to give up smoking, so we should be very careful not to halt that trend," she said. Welsh Lib Dems leader Kirsty Williams AM said the e-cigarette ban was completely unjustifiable. "The evidence for this decision is wafer thin," she said.  "Banning things just for the sake of it isn't a position any government should take." The Royal College of Physicians was disappointed there was no firm action on tackling obesity and physical inactivity "which has a huge impact on health and chronic illness".	People will be banned from using e-cigarettes in enclosed places such as restaurants, pubs and at work in Wales, under a new public health law.
Earlier this month, NRW estimated the lagoon would mean 21% of salmon and 25% of sea trout dying each year, as they migrate to and from local rivers. Tidal Lagoon Power (TLP) said the claims had no "clear scientific basis". NRW said its figures were based on the "best available evidence" it received. In a briefing note sent to AMs and seen by BBC Wales, TLP disputed NRW's figures and claimed that the regulator refused to share its methodology for calculating them. "Without clear scientific basis NRW has recently published figures based in these 'what if' scenarios despite our request to consider the evidence needed to back them up prior to publication," the briefing said. "These scenarios give unrealistic and grossly misleading impact figures [on fish]," the briefing adds. TLP said that computer modelling carried out by experts on its behalf estimated a "worst case scenario" of the lagoon killing 2% of all species of fish. The Â£1.3bn Swansea tidal lagoon project is being viewed by the firm as a test bed for much larger and more cost effective versions around the coast, including Cardiff, Newport and Colwyn Bay. UK government ministers are considering the findings of a six-month review of the viability of the scheme, which is yet to be published. Wales' Environment Secretary Lesley Griffiths said the Welsh Government was "very supportive" of the scheme. But she said both it and the industry needed clarity on the UK government's position in the "very, very near future." NRW said it strongly disagreed with TLP's criticism, which it was "very surprised and disappointed by". Gareth O'Shea, an NRW executive director, said: "We have received a vast amount of evidence on this subject from the applicant and have held detailed discussions with the developer for a year-and-a-half where we have shared a huge amount of information, data and our methodology. "This has been assessed by independent experts and our own technical experts, and we have the utmost confidence that it is the best evidence available to enable us to make the right decision for the environment in Wales, as we are legally bound to do."	The developers of the proposed Swansea Bay tidal lagoon have accused Natural Resources Wales (NRW) of publishing a "grossly misleading" analysis of the project's likely impact on fish.
The visitors raced into a three-goal first-half lead at Hampden. Weatherson opened the scoring with an unstoppable 15th-minute free-kick, and he made it 2-0 in the 27th minute. Matt Flynn made it 3-0 six minutes later with a fine finish. Queen's pulled a consolation goal back in stoppage time through John Carter.	Peter Weatherson netted a brace as Annan recorded only their second win in eight matches.
Kane scored twice in Saturday's 3-0 win over Norwich to reach 11 Premier League goals this season and 27 for 2015, breaking Teddy Sheringham's club record for league goals in a calendar year. Last term the England man scored 31 times in all competitions during a breakthrough campaign at senior level. "There is no price. No-one can buy him," Pochettino said. "He is not for sale. There is not a value because it is impossible to put a price." With Manchester United losing at Stoke and Crystal Palace drawing with Bournemouth, victory over the Canaries saw Spurs consolidate fourth place in the table. Pochettino's side are now two points ahead of Palace in fifth and three points clear of sixth-placed United. Spurs play next at Watford in a 15:00 GMT kick-off on Monday - with midfielder Mousa Dembele a doubt after picking up an ankle knock.	Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino says 22-year-old striker Harry Kane is not for sale at any price.
Swiss Xhaka, 24, is believed to have been with a friend who had visited him in London and was returning home. The man is understood to have arrived late for his flight back to Germany and was not allowed to board. It is at this point that the racial abuse is alleged to have occurred. Arsenal have declined to comment other than to say it is a private matter that is now in the hands of the police. A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police told the BBC: "Police were called at 19:29 GMT on Monday, 23 January following an allegation that a member of staff had been racially abused at Heathrow Airport, Terminal Five. "The allegation was made by a third party. Officers attended and spoke with a man in his 20s. He was not arrested. He voluntarily attended a west London police station where he was interviewed under caution. Enquires continue." The incident occurred just over 24 hours after Xhaka was sent off during his team's 2-1 victory over Burnley in the Premier League.	Arsenal midfielder Granit Xhaka has been interviewed under caution by police following an allegation he racially abused an airline staff member at Heathrow on Monday night.
The St Athan Search and Rescue Helicopter Service was officially launched on Thursday. From its £7m Vale of Glamorgan base, it will conduct land and sea missions previously carried out by the RAF. It started operating on 4 October and has so far completed eight missions. The new base is one of 10 being set up around the UK by 2017, with 22 helicopters set to conduct land and sea searches on behalf of HM Coastguard. A ten-year contract was awarded by the Department for Transport to Bristow Helicopters to deliver the service. Two of the new bases are in Wales, with one in Caernarfon, Gwynedd replacing RAF Valley and St Athan covering an area once served by helicopters from RAF Chivenor in Devon. There are two Agusta Westland AW139 helicopters based at St Athan, each worth around £7.5m and fitted with night vision and state-of-the art medical equipment. "We aim to be ready to fly within 15 minutes of the call in the day and 45 minutes at night. But for the last emergency we were airborne in seven minutes," said Capt Olly Padbury. "We also had a call within 45 minutes of going live on 4 October, so it shows the importance of the service." The 30-person team will be on 24-hour call and cover an area that runs roughly between mid Wales, Bude in Cornwall, Oxford and London. Capt Padbury said the base's location meant the two helicopters could get quickly to areas that receive large amounts of emergency calls- such as Worm's Head on Gower, Fishguard in Pembrokeshire and Woolacombe Beach in Devon. Moving at speeds of roughly 160mph, the crew travelled to Weston-Super-Mare, Somerset, in seven minutes to answer a call of a man stuck in mud recently. Other call-outs have been to a horse rider who fell in west Wales and someone who had fallen at Cheddar Gorge, Somerset. Another recent mission was to aid the Central Beacons Mountain Rescue Team, who made an emergency call after a walker fell near Ystradfellte, Powys and had a pelvis injury. Richard Parkes, the director of maritime operations at the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, called the base launch a "bittersweet" moment. He praised the previous rescue work conducted from Chivenor, saying: "A high benchmark has been set by the RAF through 70 years of search and rescue. "The challenge is to emulate it."	Rescues of a fallen horse rider, someone trapped in a gorge and a man stuck in mud are among the first missions completed by a new helicopter unit.
A police source told the BBC that an infiltrator from the Taliban had allowed militants into the police station in the regional capital of Lashkar Gah last night. The infiltrator fled the scene with the Taliban, he said. A spokesperson for provincial governor Omar Zuak confirmed the incident, but did not provide details. No group has officially claimed responsibility. Lashkar Gah has come under increased pressure from the Taliban in recent months. The city of 200,000 people is seen as strategically important, and the key to holding Helmand province. The province is both a fertile farming region and a centre for opium production, bordering Pakistan on one end and covering major routes between cities. Thousands of people fled the rural areas to shelter in Lashkar Gah last August, before the city itself came under attack in October. The city was previously the scene of heavy fighting between the Taliban and Nato-led forces before their withdrawal in 2014.	At least 13 policemen were killed by one of their own in Afghanistan's southern Helmand province.
Prison inspectors discovered the average period of stay at the facility near Gatwick Airport had risen from 28 to 48 days. Twenty-three people were held for more than a year. The Home Office said it did not want to detain people for longer than necessary but some had prolonged the process. Brook House holds almost 400 adult male asylum seekers, illegal immigrants and foreign national offenders. Despite a push by the Home Office last year to reduce the number of people being detained, inspectors could not identify why periods of detention had lengthened. The report added that some detainees at the G4S-run centre had been held for excessive periods due to "unreasonable delays in immigration decision making". Peter Clarke, chief inspector of prisons, said the lack of analysis made it "hard to see how detention periods could be systematically reduced and the inevitably negative outcomes for detainees mitigated". A 2016 Home Office review said fewer people should be detained in immigration centres, while pointing out that each place cost Â£34,000 a year. In response to the report a spokesman said: "Detention is an important tool that helps us remove those with no right to be in the country and it is vital that this is carried out with dignity and respect." But he said some of those being held had attempted to frustrate the removal process by failing to provide accurate and timely information about their identity. He said of the people leaving detention in 2016, 64% left within 29 days and 93% in less than four months. The centre was assessed as "reasonably good" on safety, respect, activities, and preparation for removal or release, but inspectors were concerned that the residential units "very closely resembled" a prison. Director of the removal centre, Ben Saunders, said inspectors had "rightly" identified the purpose-built design was stark in some places, and G4S would work with the Home Office, which owns the buildings, to soften the environment. Brook House opened in 2009 but a year later was branded "fundamentally unsafe". A further report in 2012 found there were still "significant concerns", but in 2013 inspectors saw sustained improvement.	Four men have been held for more than two years at Brook House immigration removal centre as the average length of detentions has grown, a report found.
The 30-year-old County Down man became the first Irish cyclist to win a world track title in 117 years with victory in the scratch race in Belarus in 2013. Irvine also won a World Cup gold in Manchester in the same year. "Missing out on the Olympics is a big part of it and I fell out of love with cycling," said the Northern Irishman. He added: "The passion to train and put all that time into it has gone. I would just be wasting my time if I carried on." Media playback is not supported on this device Irvine secured silver in the individual pursuit in Belarus an hour before his triumph in the scratch event at the 2013 World Championship. It was a rollercoaster year for Irvine, who also won silver in the points race at the World Championships and a European bronze medal in addition to sustaining a couple of injuries. A month after his Belarus triumph, Irvine suffered a leg fracture during the Tour of Taiwan road racing event later in 2013 sustained leg muscle injuries at a track event in Belgium. However, Irvine finished 2013 as number one scratch rider in the 2013 UCI world rankings and claimed a scratch silver medal in the 2014 Track Cycling World Championships. His achievements in 2013 led to him being named as the BBC Northern Ireland Sports Personality of the Year. Media playback is not supported on this device After winning silver in the scratch race at the 2014 World Championships in Colombia, Irvine was regarded as a strong medal contender at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow and improving on the team pursuit bronze that he won with Northern Ireland in Delhi in 2008. However, Irvine produced disappointing performances in Glasgow and has struggled to regain form since then, with a number of injuries not helping. Irvine said the "aches and pains" were another factor in his decision to retire. "I just loved the fact that I got cycling to be more mainstream than it used to be," he added. "I'm glad I achieved some world and European success - I got some medals and got my name in the history books."	Ireland's former world champion Martyn Irvine has retired from competitive cycling after failing to qualify for the Rio Olympics this summer.
Barcelona said it paid €57m (£43m) for Neymar in 2013 but investigators say the fee was closer to €83m and Barcelona concealed part of the deal. Neymar spent an hour and a half before the judge. He has previously denied wrongdoing, in an interview with Brazilian media. Leaving court, the football star signed autographs for fans. Barcelona FC says his parents, Neymar da Silva Santos and Nadine Goncalves da Silva Santos, received €40m and his former club, Santos, was paid €17m. Neymar's father, who arrived at court with him on Tuesday evening, acts as his agent. The case was brought by Brazilian third-party investment fund DIS, which owned 40% of the Brazilian player's sports rights. DIS alleges it was financially harmed by the transfer when it received €6.8m of Santos's €17m fee and argues it was deprived of its full share. Barcelona FC President Josep Maria Bartomeu and his predecessor, Sandro Rosell, were called to give evidence at the court in Madrid on Monday, but they refused to testify. They insisted instead on the version of events they had given at a previous hearing. In a statement on Monday, the club said: "They are not worried and said they have confidence in justice." The pair are also accused in a separate case of defrauding the Spanish tax office of an estimated €13m. They deny the allegations. Neymar's move to Barcelona FC has been a big success on the pitch. The striker became part of a goal-scoring trio with Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez. In 2015, Neymar helped the club win five trophies and came third in the Fifa Ballon d'Or competition. He also scored in the Uefa Champions League final against Juventus. But the 23-year-old has also encountered legal difficulties in Brazil, where a court has frozen $47m (£33m) of his assets in connection with suspected tax evasion between 2011 and 2013.	Brazilian football star Neymar has appeared in court in connection with allegations of corruption and fraud surrounding his transfer to FC Barcelona.
Many of them made headlines - from banning all Muslims entering the US, to building a wall along the border with Mexico. But as he and his White House team approach the 100-day mark of his presidency, it is clear he has shifted his stance on a number of key issues. Before: As a candidate, Mr Trump derided climate change as a hoax concocted by China, and the regulations of Paris as stifling to American growth. After: After three months of prevarications behind the closed doors of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, the president came down decisively on the side near the exits. Quitting the Paris deal, signed by nearly 200 countries, will take a few years but this is unequivocally a promise kept. Before: One of Mr Trump's trademark rally pledges was to repeal and replace Obamacare - his predecessor's attempt to extend healthcare to the estimated 15% of the country who are not covered. It is widely hated by Republicans, who say the law imposes too many costs on business, with many describing it as a "job killer" and decrying the reforms - officially the Affordable Care Act - as an unwarranted intrusion into the affairs of private businesses and individuals. After: Within two days of his election he softened his approach, saying he wanted to keep the "strongest assets". Then the House Republicans put forward a plan, which the president fully backed, but it was mauled by doctors' groups, hospitals and other parts of the medical industry. The government's own budget office said it would strip insurance from millions of Americans, and its approval rating among the public sank. The Democrats opposed it and several wings of the Republican party were uneasy. It was passed by the House of Representatives but the Senate has said it will rewrite the bill from scratch. Before: His vow to build a wall along the US-Mexican border was one of the most controversial of Mr Trump's campaign promises. Mr Trump also insisted that Mexico would pay for it. After: Mexico maintains it will never pay for it, and even the president has conceded that the US will have to pay up front and then seek reimbursement in some way. The US Congress is exploring funding options for the wall, but many Republicans will be unhappy about footing a bill which could rise to $21.5bn (Â£17.2bn), according to a Department of Homeland Security internal report. That's much higher than Mr Trump's estimated price tag of $12bn (Â£9.6bn). There are also landowners who protest against a "government land grab" - and a lawsuit from an environmental group launched in April. "We're building the wall," he said in February. "In fact it's going to start very soon." Before: Mr Trump called Nafta "a disaster" and warned that the TPP "is going to be worse, so we will stop it." After: Mr Trump pledged to withdraw from the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP). He did in his first few days. And he vowed to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Association (Nafta) and, after threatening to pull out, the White House has said that Canada and the US have agreed to talks. Before: Mr Trump initially promised to ban all Muslims entering the US - a "total and complete" shutdown should remain until the US authorities "can figure out what's going on". But he switched to "extreme vetting" after he became the party's presidential candidate. After: As president, he has introduced two travel bans, which have both become ensnarled by legal challenges. The second was a slightly watered-down version of the first, but a judge in Hawaii said barring people from six mainly Muslim countries, even temporarily, violated constitutional protections against religious discrimination. Another judge in Maryland cited Trump campaign statements as evidence. President Trump has railed against "judicial overreach" and hinted that he may take the case to the Supreme Court, but has said little on the matter in a round of media interviews this week. Five questions on the revised travel ban Before: Mr Trump repeatedly told his supporters that every single undocumented immigrant - of which there are 11.3 million - "have to go". After: As polling day approached, his stance began to soften slightly, then after the election he scaled it back to some two to three million deportations of people who "are criminal and have criminal records, gang members, drug dealers". The Migration Policy Institute, a US-based think tank, has one of the higher figures for illegal immigrants with criminal records, which it puts at 890,000, including people charged with crossing the border illegally. The number of removals peaked in 2012 and has been falling since. It is too early to say if there has been an increase since President Trump's inauguration. Reality Check: Is deporting of 'bad dudes' at record rate? Trump voter's husband faces deportation Before: Mr Trump repeatedly questioned the military alliance's purpose, calling it "obsolete". One issue that bugged him was whether members were pulling their weight and "paying their bills". In one New York Times interview in July 2016, he even hinted that the US would not come to the aid of a member invaded by Russia. After: But as he hosted Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg at the White House in April, the US president said the threat of terrorism had underlined the alliance's importance. "I said it [Nato] was obsolete," Mr Trump said. "It's no longer obsolete." Before: During a speech in Iowa in November 2015, Mr Trump warned that he would, using an expletive, bomb so-called Islamic State into obliteration. After: The president dropped the biggest non-nuclear bomb in the US arsenal on an IS-stronghold in Afghanistan. At the site of the Mother of All Bombs Before: Mr Trump repeatedly pledged to label Beijing a "currency manipulator" on his first day in office, during an election campaign when he also accused the Asian powerhouse of "raping" the US. China has been accused of suppressing the yuan to make its exports more competitive with US goods. After: He told the Wall Street Journal in April that China had not been "currency manipulators" for some time and had actually been trying to prevent the yuan from further weakening. Before: "I am looking for judges and have actually picked 20 of them. They'll respect the Second Amendment and what it stands for and what it represents." After: He vowed to appoint a conservative justice and he has - Neil Gorsuch. It took a procedural change to Senate rules, but it's a victory nonetheless. Before: Mr Trump said he would approve waterboarding "immediately" and "make it also much worse", adding "torture works". After: But after his inauguration, the president said he would defer to the opposing belief, espoused by Defence Secretary James Mattis and CIA director Mike Pompeo. Mr Pompeo said during his confirmation hearing said he would "absolutely not" reinstate such methods. Before: "Lock her up" was one of the main rallying cries of Mr Trump's supporters. They wanted to see Democratic rival Hillary Clinton in prison over the use of her private email server while secretary of state. And Mr Trump was more than willing to back their calls for, at the very least, a fresh investigation. During the debates, he told Mrs Clinton: "If I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation." After: The president-elect's tone changed almost as soon as he had won, describing the woman he had said was "such a nasty woman" as someone the country owed "a debt of gratitude". Later, he said he "hadn't given [the prosecution] a lot of thought" and had other priorities. On 22 November, Mr Trump's spokeswoman said he would not pursue a further investigation - to help Mrs Clinton "heal". Before: The country's infrastructure "will become, by the way, second to none, and we will put millions of our people back to work as we rebuild it", he said in his victory speech in November. After: Has repeated his vow to spend big on the country's roads, rail and airports, but no sign yet of action. Before: Mr Trump pledged during his campaign to move the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, a divided city which both Israelis and Palestinians claim. After: He approved a waiver to keep the embassy in place, but suggested in a statement that it would be eventually relocated. "The question is not if that move happens, but only when," the White House said, adding the decision was taken in order to "maximize the chances of successfully negotiating a deal between Israel and the Palestinians".	Donald Trump made a string of promises during his long campaign to be the 45th president of the United States.

With a television audience of 110 million, it's one of the biggest platforms in the world - and Gaga has been putting in the hours to ensure her set is suitably spectacular. "We were [rehearsing] in the tent for about a week and a half, then we had to move to bigger studios in Hollywood where we are working on the rest of the show," she told Houston radio station Mix 96.5. "And then we will send that equipment to Houston where we will finish rehearsals. Fans can expect a performance that spans my career so far." She has a high standard to live up to - notably Prince's show in 2007, which took place in the middle of a Miami thunderstorm and is widely accepted as the greatest performance in the event's history, if not Prince's career. Here are some of the other most memorable - and surprising - moments from the last 30 years. Super Bowl performers get a very strict 12-minute time limit, so most performers cram their set with as much music as possible. Not Michael Jackson. After shooting onto the stage at the Pasadena Rose Bowl, he stood completely still, staring at the world for a full 90 seconds. Ninety. It was a master class in ratcheting expectation to a fever pitch. And the screams when he launched into Jam (not one of his best songs) proved he knew what he was doing. Brilliantly, Jackson staged this entire performance while wearing a jacket it looked like he'd borrowed from Muammar Gaddafi. Beat that, Gaga. Baby, he was born to run... and slide on his knees... and crotch slam a TV camera. In his autobiography, The Boss explains the incident like this: "Too much adrenalin, a late drop, too much speed, here I come, Mikeâ€¦ BOOM! "And I'm onto his camera, the lens implanted into my chest with one leg off the stage. I use his camera to push myself back up andâ€¦ BLAM! BORN TO RUN!" It led to the memorable headline: "America Attacked by Bruce Springsteen's crotch" - but it didn't stop the star delivering one of the most powerful and energetic Super Bowl shows in recent history. Even if they were fined for over-running by 40 seconds. Coldplay were the headline act at last year's Super Bowl in Santa Clara - but someone forgot to tell Beyonce. She only performed one song, Formation, underscoring its message of black pride and power with back-up dancers dressed in leather body suits and black berets reminiscent of the Black Panthers movement. Some of her dancers were even pictured holding up a sign declaring "Justice 4 Mario Woods" - a 26-year-old black man who was shot dead by armed police in San Francisco two months earlier. The performance heralded the arrival of her unapologetically political album, Lemonade, later in the year. You can't out-diva Diana, something she was determined to prove when she strode onto the pitch in Tempe, Arizona, for Super Bowl XXX. She raced through 10 songs and four costume changes in 12 minutes, then jumped into a helicopter and fled the stadium. Which is one way to beat the post-game traffic. For the first few decades, the Super Bowl half-time performance featured marching bands, drill teams and Disney's mouseketeers. 1987's show was altogether more bizarre. A magician named "Elvis Presto" burst out of a jukebox, before performing a series of conjuring tricks, aided by 2,000 part-time dancers, 102 custom Harley Davidson motorcycles and some of rock's biggest classics. At the culmination of the show, the "Prince of Prestidigitation" performed an interactive magic trick ("pick a card, concentrate real hard") while viewers at home watched through 3D glasses. It was cheesier than a wheel of brie - and prompted the NFL to adopt a more modern approach. She arrived on a mechanical tiger, and departed on a shooting star - but Katy Perry couldn't compete with the infamous "left shark". He was one of two foam-suited dancers flanking Katy while she performed Teenage Dream. While the one on the right was forgettable, the left shark flailed around in a desperate attempt to remember his dance moves. It quickly became a viral sensation, spawning a whole range of merchandise from the ever-savvy pop star. And when the half-time show was nominated for an Emmy, Katy made sure to thank her faithful friend. Poor old Janet Jackson. She was at the end of a triumphant, hit-laden medley when Justin Timberlake ripped the front off her bodice, revealing a heavily-bejewelled superboob. Few ever believed that the "wardrobe malfunction" was indeed a malfunction - but if you look at the photographs taken immediately after the event, Jackson appears mortified (notably, these were not the pictures printed by the press). Nonetheless, America went apoplectic. The Federal Complaints Commission reportedly got more than 200,000 complaints, while Janet was blacklisted by MTV and radio. Her career never fully recovered. But there is a bright side to this story. A PayPal employee called Jawed Karim missed the half-time show and grew frustrated that he couldn't watch the incident online. In response, he and his friends Steve Chen and Chad Hurley began coding a website where people could upload their own content. That site would end up being YouTube.

The Edinburgh-based group said profit increased by 22.6% to £31.5m, while revenues were down 6.8%, to £242.3m. However, total operating costs were cut by 6.7% to £191.7m. The figures were released as Johnston confirmed that shareholders had overwhelmingly backed a deal to buy the i newspaper from ESI Media for £24m. It said the acquisition would give the company "numerous revenue and cost synergy opportunities", contribute positively to earnings and "allow us to accelerate growth in digital, and help stabilise our circulation revenues". In its annual results statement, the owner of The Scotsman and more than 200 other titles said "challenging trading conditions" in the second half of last year had continued into 2016. Total revenues for the first eight weeks of this year were down 13% "against strong year-on-year comparatives" in the first quarter of 2015. Other Johnston Press financial highlights for 2015: In January the group revealed plans to cut editorial jobs across its operations in the UK, as part of a drive to cut costs following a decline in revenue. Chief executive Ashley Highfield said: "We have reduced costs to maintain profitability, reset our portfolio and refocused on priority markets with attractive audiences that offer the best opportunity for growth. "Success in driving our national display advertising business in 2015 and the rollout of our local display advertising sales force initiative gives me confidence for the future despite the fact that the market remains difficult." The company stated that this year it would "focus on and invest in our primary brands, operating in growth markets with attractive audiences". Johnston added: "We have identified a number of newsbrands that are now considered non-core and such will be either divested or run with less costs, reflecting the medium-term outlook for the identified assets that fall into this category. "The company will run a formal process, with advisers, to market defined asset groups for sale during 2016. Interest by third parties, enquiring about assets, has been encouraging so far."	Cost-cutting measures helped publisher Johnston Press achieve a rise in adjusted pre-tax profit last year, despite falling sales.
The 66-year-old, of Ballybinaby, Hackballscross, County Louth, faces nine tax charges at the Republic of Ireland's Special Criminal Court. Prosecutors claim he had significant dealings in cattle and land and received farming grants but failed to submit tax returns for nine years. Mr Murphy denies the offences. His defence lawyers claim that their client's brother, Patrick Murphy, managed his cattle herd and farming activities. The prosecution at the three-judge, non-jury court was brought after an investigation by the Irish Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB). One of the judges indicated that the verdict may be delivered next Thursday, 17 December, but added it is "by no means certain". Mr Murphy was remanded on continuing bail until 17 December.	The trial of the prominent republican Thomas "Slab" Murphy for alleged tax evasion has heard the court may deliver judgement on the case next week.
At the top, but not in the inner circle. As the first Muslim woman to sit in the cabinet she was a crucial symbol of David Cameron's efforts to modernise the Tories. But now she has left the government - and in a way designed to inflict damage. The prime minister was only told shortly about her decision to quit before she announced it on her Twitter feed. She'd also done an interview, explaining her decision, which was published on the Huffington Post website within the hour. David Cameron's response to her resignation contained a jibe - he had "much regret" she hadn't talked to him about her concerns before she quit. But there was also a warm tribute. "I would like you to know how much I have personally appreciated your support and friendship over the years' he wrote. There is no evidence though that Mr Cameron is changing his mind or re-assessing the government's stance on Israel's conduct during this war. The prime minister has faced criticism from some in his own party for not condemning Israel for what they believe is its disproportionate use of force against Hamas and civilians in Gaza. He described an attack on Monday as a "slaughter" and he said the situation was "intolerable". Other senior ministers have called it a "catastrophe". But neither Mr Cameron nor any Conservative minister has said that Israel has gone beyond what is proportionate. The response on Tuesday afternoon from the new foreign secretary, Philip Hammond, was telling. What Lady Warsi has labelled a "morally indefensible" position he has dismissed as a call for "megaphone diplomacy". He emphasised that he felt he had to be "balanced". That reveals how deep the divide was between two people who were supposed to be working together.	Sayeeda Warsi has been a permanent feature at the top of the Conservative Party since David Cameron became leader almost a decade ago.
The program - called Vital - will vote on whether to invest in a specific company or not. The firm it will be working for - Deep Knowledge Ventures -  focuses on drugs for age-related diseases. It said that Vital would make its recommendations by sifting through large amounts of data. The algorithm looks at a range of data when making decisions - including financial information, clinical trials for particular drugs, intellectual property owned by the firm and previous funding. "On first sight, it looks like a futuristic idea but on reflection it is really a little bit of publicity hype," said Prof Noel Sharkey of the University of Sheffield. "A lot of companies use large data search to access what is happening on the market, then the board or trusted workers can decide on the advice. "With financial markets, algorithms are delegated with decisions. The idea of the algorithm voting is a gimmick. It is not different from the algorithm making a suggestion and the board voting on it." According to Deep Knowledge Ventures, Vital has already approved two investment decisions. The software was developed by UK-based Aging Analytics.	A venture capital firm has appointed a computer algorithm to its board of directors.
Media playback is not supported on this device Wednesday's 3-0 defeat at Sunderland was the second time they have conceded three goals since losing to Manchester United at Wembley on 23 April. Everton are 12th in the table with one win from their past 10 league games. "We tried to get the focus after being in the FA Cup semi-final and sometimes it drops the intensity," said Martinez. Martinez has come under pressure from some Everton fans this season, while Ajax manager Frank de Boer and Southampton boss Ronald Koeman have been linked with his job this month. Patrick van Aanholt's free-kick and two close-range strikes from Lamine Kone sealed a comfortable win for Sunderland at the Stadium of Light which secured their survival and relegated Newcastle and Norwich. Spaniard Martinez, who took over from David Moyes in June 2013 and signed a new five-year contract in 2014, added: "The effort we put in deserved a lot more. "It was not an easy game and Sunderland had a lot of momentum with their focus on the league. "We have one more game to get the winning feeling and perform in a manner in which we can get the three points and end the season better." Everton finished fifth in the table with a record Premier League points tally in their first season under Martinez in 2013-14, and 11th the following year. They end their campaign at home to Norwich on Sunday.	Manager Roberto Martinez says Everton have struggled to focus on the Premier League following their FA Cup semi-final defeat.
The new rule comes from Iran's Supreme Council of Cyberspace and firms have been given one year to comply. Campaign group Privacy International described it as "extremely worrying" but said it could prove difficult to enforce. Iran's most popular messaging app is Berlin-based service Telegram, believed to be used by one in four Iranians. Messages shared via Telegram, which is free to use, are encrypted and can be seen by many users at once. Telegram could not be reached for comment but reports circulating on social networks that it has decided to comply are understood to be false. Most social networks are officially blocked by the state but lots of people are able to access them via services like Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), which mask a browser's geographical location. The country's president, Hassan Rouhani, has active Twitter accounts in English and Persian. In my view, Telegram has a tough job ahead of it when deciding whether to go ahead with what the government wants. People are worried about losing it but they are also saying they will stop using it if the firm complies with the new law. This is a big thing for people in Iran. They are very sensitive about security. If Telegram does what is asked, then the government will have control over the content, it can monitor who is saying what, and it can arrest people. The app was shut down briefly last year for refusing to comply with the government - and that added to its popularity. Just recently BBC Persian covered a story about high school students protesting about their exams - they created a Telegram group to mobilise and inform other students about the protest. The group got 20,000 subscribers and the protest went well. But as soon as it got media coverage the government told the group administrators to close it down. In a short time, the number of subscribers came down to just 300.	Instant messaging apps must store data about Iranian users inside the country, Iran has ordered.
The fire, which is being treated as deliberate, was first reported at about 11:00 BST on Sunday. Eight fire appliances and 45 fire fighters are at the scene, including crew members from the Irish Fire Service. The blaze has spread across a 5 kilometre area, crossing the border. It is the latest of 435 reported wildfires since the beginning of May. Group Commander Brian Stanfield said: "We believe this fire has been started deliberately and we believe there are still people in the area qho are starting fires. "We'd like to appeal to members of the public. This is reckless behaviour, this is not just endangering the countryside, but it is putting people's lives and property at risk."	The Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service (NIFRS) is attending a gorse fire in Alderwood Road near Clogher and Fivemiletown in County Tyrone.

A member of the public alerted the emergency services to the discovery at about 21:00 on Sunday. Police Scotland said formal identification has still to take place, but that Mr Mitchell's family have been informed. The 18-year-old was last seen in Inverness on 10 November on CCTV. Searches were made of areas of Inverness, including along the shore of the nearby Moray Firth. St Fergus, near Peterhead, is also on the Moray Firth coast.	The family of missing Inverness teenager Adam Mitchell have been informed of the discovery of a man's body near St Fergus in Aberdeenshire.
Jason Rezaian, a dual US-Iranian citizen, has been accused of passing information to "hostile governments". He defended himself in court, saying he had carried out his activities as a journalist, Iranian media reported. Mr Rezaian could face up to 20 years in prison if convicted. He is being tried in one of Tehran's revolutionary courts, usually reserved for political cases or those related to national security. Mr Rezaian appeared in court alongside his wife, Yeganeh Salehi, and a third detainee, reported to be a female photojournalist. The judge, Abolghassem Salavati, outlined the charges against Mr Rezaian as "espionage through collecting classified information and providing it to hostile governments" and "spreading propaganda against the regime", Iran's Mehr news agency reported. Mr Rezaian rejected some of the charges, Mehr reported, saying: "I am a journalist and I carried out all my activities legally and as a journalist." The presiding judge, Abolghassem Salavati, is known for handing down harsh sentences and is accused by human rights groups of cracking down on journalists and activists. He has been dubbed the "judge of death" for imposing several death sentences after the 2009 post-election opposition protests. He first came to public attention in 2006 when he sentenced two defendants to death for the murder of Hassan Moghadas, the Revolutionary Court judge who sentenced a prominent journalist - Akbar Ganji - to 15 years in jail. Since then, Mr Salavati has presided over or sat in the trials of several prominent political figures, including a daughter of former President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani. In January 2009, he found four people guilty of conspiring with the US government against Iran in their work on an HIV prevention programme. In September 2014, Mr Salavati sentenced Mohsen Amir-Aslani to death for heresy for his interpretation of the Jonah and the Whale story as a symbolic tale. Source: BBC Monitoring's Armen Shahbazian What are Iran's revolutionary courts? The US State Department repeated its call for the "absurd charges" to be dropped. Iran has not recently commented on the case, but the Washington Post has spoken out forcefully. "The shameful acts of injustice continue without end in the treatment of [Mr] Rezaian," a statement by the newspaper's Executive Editor Martin Baron said on Monday. "Now we learn his trial will be closed to the world. And so it will be closed to the scrutiny it fully deserves. "There is no justice in this system, not an ounce of it, and yet the fate of a good, innocent man hangs in the balance." The paper points out that Mr Rezaian was arrested without charge and jailed in Iran's notorious Evin prison - placed in isolation for many months and denied medical care he needed. His brother, Ali, meanwhile told the BBC there was no evidence to support the charges: "They've cherry-picked information to come up with whatever they could to charge him with to make it seem like there was a reason that they've held him." The BBC's US state department correspondent, Barbara Plett Usher, says US officials have repeatedly raised his case during months of nuclear negotiations with Iran, but have declined to link the two. The imprisoned journalist's family have taken heart from recent comments by President Barack Obama, who said that the White House would not rest until Mr Rezaian was brought home safely, our correspondent adds. The case is all the more sensitive because it has unfolded during negotiations between Iran and the West over the country's nuclear programme. Some analysts have suggested the arrest was related to internal power struggles in Iran over the outcome of the talks. Iran and six major world powers, including the US, have set a 30 June deadline for a conclusive nuclear deal to end a 10-year impasse. Mr Rezaian had been the Washington Post's Tehran bureau chief since 2012. His wife, Yeganeh Salehi, was arrested alongside him in July but later bailed after spending two and a half months in custody. It is not clear when the next trial session will be held.	The trial of a Washington Post journalist detained in Iran for almost 10 months on charges that include "espionage" has opened in the capital Tehran behind closed doors.
The crash happened at about 17:35 GMT. A woman was also injured in the crash, but her injuries are not believed to be life threatening.

The move will see the supermarket open Giraffe branches near to Tesco stores as it seeks to create "retail destinations" for customers. Tesco will hope that the acquisition will help revitalise its UK business. Over the past year, the group has been revamping its UK stores. In January, it reported its strongest growth in UK Christmas sales for three years, but said there was "a lot more to do". Tesco pointed to Giraffe's popularity with a wide range of ages, particularly families, as part of its appeal. "We think our customers will love it," said group commercial director Kevin Grace. The supermarket recently bought a 49% stake in Harris and Hoole coffee shops, a move which drew criticism from some shoppers who felt they had been duped into believing it was an independent business. It has also invested in the Euphorium Bakery chain. "I think it's a very significant move," Neil Saunders, managing director of Conlumino told BBC News. "Traditional retailing is seeing much more sluggish growth and one of the things that all retailers have got to do is look to wider areas of spending including leisure and dining out. "[This] exposes Tesco to much more lucrative growth." Analysts also suggested that the move could help Tesco solve a crucial problem: what to do with the retail space that was once devoted to things like CDs and movies. Tesco can "implant Giraffe restaurants into its larger stores where it has an excess of retail space," said UBS food retail analyst Mike Tattersall. Giraffe founders Russel and Juliette Joffe and Andrew Jacobs will remain in place on the management team, with Russel Joffe continuing as managing director. "This move will allow us to introduce Giraffe to a wider audience, presents great opportunities for growth and for the team to be involved in an exciting stage in our brand's development," said Mr Joffe. Private equity firms 3i and Risk Capital Partners have sold their stakes in the business.	Supermarket group Tesco has bought the restaurant chain Giraffe for £48.6m.
The tech companies will help design the subsea cable which will run between Virginia in the US and Bilbao, Spain. The project will be managed by Spanish telecommunications firm Telefonica, which will sell any unused capacity on the cable to other customers. The cable will help the tech giants move data more quickly and cheaply between their global data centres. Tech companies typically have to pay telecommunications firms to use their cables, which can be costly. And the large amounts of data moving across those lines can make them slower. The project, called MAREA, will be the highest-capacity sub-sea cable across the Atlantic, with an expected capacity of some 160 terabits per second of data, the companies said. It is not the first subsea cable to be sponsored by a tech company. In 2014 Google paired up with five telecommunications firms to build a subsea cable across the Pacific Ocean. Construction of the 6,600km (4,125 miles) long cable is due to start in August and is scheduled to be completed in October 2017. Microsoft said MAREA will help boost the speed and reliability of its cloud services. "This marks an important new step in building the next generation infrastructure of the internet," said Microsoft's director of global network acquisition, Frank Rey. Microsoft has also been testing underwater data centres. These centres would be cheaper to maintain because they would not have the associated cooling costs of data centres on land and could be powered through marine energy. Facebook and its 1.23 billion monthly active users are also heavily reliant of transferring data and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg has committed to expanding global internet access.	Microsoft and Facebook have announced plans to build the highest capacity data link between the US and Europe.
The 28-year-old has spent the past four years with Danish top-flight club AGF Aarhus. Hearts head coach Robbie Neilson said: "He's got experience, a good grounding and is a great character. "We watched a lot of him on video, spoke to various people about him and got good reports and he's impressed in the time he's spent with us." He works hard and wants to do well Scotland Under-21 international Kevin McHattie is Hearts' first-choice left-back. Neilson said: "It's great to get both cover and someone to challenge Kevin." Eckersley, capped by England Under-18s, made a solitary first-team appearance while at Old Trafford, and had loan spells at Royal Antwerp, Brondby, Barnsley and Port Vale. The latter resulted in a permanent move to the Valiants, but he switched to Horsens in the Danish top flight in 2008 before moving to Aarhus two years later. He won the Danish First Division, the country's second tier, with both clubs. "He works hard and wants to do well," said Neilson on Hearts' website.	Hearts have signed former Manchester United youth-team full-back Adam Eckersley after a successful trial.
The reaction to Taylor's death on Thursday at the age of 72, and the affection expressed for him, was the true measure of his standing inside and outside football. Born in Worksop in Nottinghamshire, Taylor was the son of a journalist and rose to prominence in the game as a manager after retiring as a player with Lincoln City in 1972. He became manager and coach at the club, winning the Fourth Division title with them before moving to Watford in 1977. It was here, in tandem with his chairman Sir Elton John, that he produced arguably his finest work, taking the club from the Fourth Division to the top flight in the space of five exhilarating years. Media playback is not supported on this device Taylor nurtured Watford legends such as Luther Blissett and John Barnes, remarkably finishing second behind Liverpool in their first season at that elite level and reaching the FA Cup final in 1984, where they lost 2-0 to Everton. Not so long ago he joked with me, with his usual broad smile: "You know I have never watched any of that game from that day to this - but I don't need to see it again to know that second goal from Andy Gray was a bloody foul on our goalkeeper Steve Sherwood." Taylor's unlikely partnership with the flamboyant rock star worked against the odds, the manager's down-to-earth approach dovetailing with his chairman's lavish lifestyle. They remained friends for life, as demonstrated by Sir Elton's heartfelt tribute. On trips abroad when he worked as a BBC Sport pundit, Taylor would gladly tell stories of that partnership, always with a laugh and underlining the genuine affection they shared. Taylor's brilliance inevitably attracted attention from elsewhere and, perhaps feeling he had achieved all he could at Vicarage Road, he left for Aston Villa in May 1987. Villa were in reduced circumstances having been relegated to the second flight. Taylor soon put that right by winning promotion in his first season - and, not content with that, rebuilt the club with such success and shrewd management that he took them to second place behind Liverpool in 1990. Taylor's methods were tried and trusted and yet he often received criticism for what his detractors perceived as "long ball" football. He, with much justification, pointed out his willingness to use wingers and flair players such as Barnes and the young Mo Johnston, whom he brought to England from Partick Thistle. England inevitably looked in Taylor's direction after Sir Bobby Robson left following the 1990 World Cup in Italy, where his side lost to West Germany on penalties in the semi-final. Media playback is not supported on this device This was, without doubt, the darkest and most frustrating period of Taylor's career and is one of the reasons his other work has been so criminally underrated over the years. Taylor took over at a tough time after the loss of England mainstays such as goalkeeper Peter Shilton and past captains such as Terry Butcher and Bryan Robson. He gave players like Alan Shearer and Martin Keown their first England caps - but he drew criticism for selecting players many simply felt were not international class, such as Carlton Palmer. England reached Euro 92 in Sweden under Taylor but produced a series of disappointing performances, going out at the group stage after losing 2-1 to Sweden in Stockholm. Taylor courted controversy and criticism in that decisive game by substituting England captain and main marksman Gary Lineker for Arsenal striker Alan Smith with a goal still needed - it never arrived and Lineker never played for England again. The manager was vilified and lampooned as a "turnip" in the Sun newspaper. The campaign to qualify for the World Cup in the United States in 1994 also ended in failure, and was brutally chronicled in the fly-on-the-wall documentary 'The Impossible Job', which gave an intimate insight into the pressures Taylor was under. Those struggles were illustrated starkly in the game that effectively sealed his fate, the 2-0 loss to the Netherlands in Rotterdam. He may have operated at the highest level but he never talked down to supporters and was always interested in how they viewed the game The tortured Taylor is seen on the sidelines pleading with officials after Ronald Koeman somehow escaped a red card for a foul on England's David Platt, only to be reprieved and score the brilliant free-kick that sent the Dutch on the way to victory. He resigned the following month and stayed out of the game until returning at Wolves in March 1994. During his spell in charge he took them into the second-tier play-offs in 1994-95, where they lost to Bolton Wanderers. Taylor left in November 1995 before returning to revisit old glories. Sir Elton John was back at the helm at Watford so it was no surprise when he turned to Taylor to come back to Vicarage Road as general manager in February 1996. It was once more the perfect fit and he was back as manager a year later, winning the third-tier title in 1998 before putting Watford in the Premier League at the end of the following season after a play-off final victory over Bolton. Media playback is not supported on this device Watford, despite an early win at Liverpool, were relegated and the following season Taylor decided to retire - only to change his mind and make a comeback at Villa in February 2002. He retired for a second and final time after they struggled the following season. It was the end of one chapter and the start of another as Taylor became a respected pundit on BBC Radio 5 live, a role he performed with total assurance and perception. Taylor was part of the radio team that covered England. It was a sign of the esteem in which he was held by fans as well as players that whenever he encountered supporters abroad, he was treated with complete respect. There was barely a reference from England followers to any of his struggles in charge of the national team. To them, Taylor was a true gentleman, to be given his due not just for his work but for his warm personality and willingness to discuss football matters with anyone he met. He may have operated at the highest level but he never talked down to supporters and was always interested in how they viewed the game. As a BBC Sport colleague, Taylor was unfailingly co-operative and the consummate professional, willing to take a call at any time, even when he was meant to be spending time with his beloved wife Rita. And as well as a fount of knowledge and a man with strong opinions, Taylor was also an endless source of entertainment and stories, just as happy to poke fun at himself as everyone else. Graham Taylor was a top-class manager at club level and a true gentleman inside and outside of football. He will be greatly missed and perhaps now his work in management, viewed through the prism of this sad news, will finally get the credit it fully deserves.	Graham Taylor will be remembered by many for his unfulfilling spell in charge of England - but by plenty more as an outstanding club manager at Watford and Aston Villa and one of the nicest, most genuine men in the game.
Bill Palmer, from Southampton, called the Alex Dyke show on BBC Radio Solent about his life after his wife went into a nursing home. Dyke immediately ordered a taxi to bring Mr Palmer to the studio to allow phone-in listeners to chat to him. A recording of the call has been viewed tens of thousands of times on Facebook. The 95-year-old, from Sholing, married his wife Sheila, 85, on 2 June 2014 after they had been friends for 30 years. Shortly afterwards Sheila - who has dementia and colitis - fell and was taken into hospital. She was then moved into a nursing home, where she now lives. Mr Palmer phoned the BBC Radio Solent programme on Wednesday during a phone-in on "Love - later in life". Although he visits his wife every day, he said: "Every day is hell. I feel so alone". The production team immediately arranged to take Mr Palmer to the studio in Southampton, where he sat in on the rest of the show. Mr Palmer said: "I just sit with my wife and we tell each other we love each other, and that's it. "She knows who I am and she often says 'we did get married on the second of June didn't we?' - and that's when it hurts. "I listen to the radio and watch TV and have lots of friends, but unfortunately when you get old people don't visit - that's life." Listeners phoned in to offer support and advice to Mr Palmer. He was offered Sunday lunch, afternoon trips out and a ukulele orchestra to play for him, but he kindly turned them all down. "I didn't know such kindness existed," he told one caller. Dyke said Mr Palmer had "touched the hearts of thousands of listeners" and it was his "nicest moment in 30 years of broadcasting".	A 95-year-old invited into a BBC radio programme after calling in about being lonely has become a hit on social media.
Officers had spent the day in Dumbarton Road in Brixton, having been alerted at 06:20 GMT to a man "in possession of what looked like a firearm". Residents from two blocks of flats were evacuated but have since been allowed home. The man, in his 40s, was arrested on suspicion of having an imitation gun at about 17:15 GMT, police said.	A man has been arrested following an 11-hour stand-off with armed police in south London.
The charges include numerous counts of rape and conspiracy to rape and relate to eight victims, South Yorkshire Police said. The offences are alleged to have occurred between 2005 and 2012. The six, aged between 22 and 38 and from South Yorkshire, are due before magistrates in Sheffield on 21 March.	Five men and a woman have been charged with 53 child sexual offences relating to the alleged sexual exploitation of a number of girls in Sheffield.
The US singer complained the virtual assistant was pronouncing her surname wrong. "I called the head of Apple, Tim Cook, and he delightfully agreed to have Siri change the pronunciation of my name, finally," she said on Weekend Edition. Streisand said the second syllable of her name should be pronounced with "a soft S, like sand on the beach". Siri currently pronounces the singer's name as "StreiZAND". The next Apple update is due on 30 September. "So let's see if that happens, because I will be thrilled," Streisand told the US show on Saturday. The singer is currently on tour for her new album, Encore: Movie Partners Sing Broadway. In 2014, Streisand created US chart history by becoming the first artist to score number one albums in each of the last six decades. She is one of just a few to have won all four major US entertainment awards - an Oscar, Emmy, Grammy and an honorary Tony. Streisand has also enjoyed an illustrious film career which began with 1968's Funny Girl, for which she won an Oscar. Her other films include The Way We Were, What's Up, Doc? and the Meet the Parents sequel, Meet the Fockers.

The company said Lancaster's Caton Road substation went offline at 11:00 BST, leaving parts of the city and nearby Morecambe and Carnforth without power. Power supplies resumed at 16:30 BST in the remaining 10,000 properties after 53,000 had theirs restored earlier. The firm said it was not yet known what caused the outage and thanked customers for their "support". A flood at the facility during Storm Desmond in 2015 left 55,000 without power. The outage resulted in travel problems, with many traffic lights not working, and caused disruption to schools, universities and businesses. Lancaster town hall closed while the outage was dealt with. It later reopened but Lancaster City Council tweeted it "can only deal with basic enquiries". Salt Ayre Leisure Centre in Lancaster was closed and it only accepted cash payments when it reopened. Lancaster University was affected and tweeted wi-fi is available outside the chaplaincy centre, security lodge and information systems services. The university's student union sent a tweet telling students who were facing exams to turn up as usual. St John's Hospice and Lancaster Cathedral both tweeted that power had returned.	An estimated 63,000 properties in north Lancashire were hit by a power cut, Electricity North West has said.
Michael Sean Carson, known as "Kit", and from Cambridge, has been detained on suspicion of indecency with children and indecent assault. He has worked for clubs including Peterborough United, Cambridge United and Norwich City. Cambridgeshire Police said a man in his 70s remains in custody. Officers are working with the Football Association, local children's safeguarding boards and councils as part of their county-wide investigations. More news from Cambridgeshire	A former football coach and scout has been arrested as part of an investigation into allegations of abuse in the sport.
The woman, who wished to remain anonymous, said she was "swept off my feet" when she was contacted by a man she believed to be in Turkey. She lost her home, business and took out several loans over 14 months. She said: "The pressure was horrendous, and it got to the point where all the money had gone." More on this and other York stories Speaking to BBC Radio York, the woman, known as Nancy, said she had come out of a "bad marriage" and joined dating website Match.com "to dip my toe into the dating world". In July 2015, she received her first message. Nancy, from North Yorkshire, said: "I just connected with what seemed to be a very attractive-looking person who was really keen to talk to me. "There's a term for it - lovebombed - where you're just bombarded with affection and compliments. "When you're with someone who tells you how awful you are every day for ten years, then someone pays you some compliments... of course you're going to be swept away." After chatting for six weeks online, they then began talking via another messaging service, and she was asked for money. She was told the man and his young son had been attacked and mugged, with the boy requiring "urgent medical care". "It was a really bizarre amount of money, it was €3,750, it wasn't a straightforward amount of money I would have normally associated with a fraud," she said. "Reluctantly I sent the money, because I couldn't think of a child in distress and we seemed to be getting on really well." Nancy said she was "bombarded" with messages from the moment she woke up to when she went to sleep, with further requests for money coming in. She did not tell anyone about what she was experiencing. Nancy said: "As soon as the money requests came through it was posed to me that I shouldn't tell anybody because it would look really bad, nobody would understand." Action Fraud advice Nancy continued: "I came from one abusive relationship and went straight back into another one. "The manipulation was so extreme that I was told that if I didn't send money, they would starve and die. I didn't want that on my conscience. "You get to the point where you have lost so much money, you have to keep going in the hope that you're wrong." After reading fraud advice online, Nancy went to police at the start of September, but by this time, more than £300,000 had gone. No arrests have been made over the crime, also known as 'catfishing'. Nancy added: "I've got no house and huge debts, but the pressure has now gone. "I've restarted my business and have got a really good support network now."	A woman "lovebombed" out of more than £300,000 in an online dating scam has shared her story as a warning to others.
A Canadian Lancaster, currently on a UK tour, performed an engine shutdown during a flight in County Durham. Its owners said it landed safely at Durham Tees Valley airport following the "precautionary" shutdown. It had been due to fly to Bournemouth to take part in weekend displays with an RAF Lancaster bomber. An airport spokesman said the plane had experienced an "issue" with one of its engines as it was approaching the runway at the end of a 30-minute demonstration flight for invited guests. "The aircraft landed safely and nobody was injured and it taxied to stand. "The Lancaster has been returned to the hangar and engineers are conducting tests to determine the cause of the fault," he added. The last remaining flying Lancasters - owned by the RAF Battle of Britain Memorial Flight and the Canadian Warplane Heritage Museum - were due to fly at the Bournemouth Air Festival as well as the Shoreham Air Show and the Gedling Show in Nottinghamshire, as part of a two-month UK tour by the Canadian aircraft. The aircraft are based at RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire for the duration of the visit. There were over 7,000 of the type of aircraft produced between 1941 and 1946. A statement from Bournemouth Air Festival said: "We share the disappointment of all the Canadian Lancaster fans but we understand that she is over 70 years old and these sort of things can and do happen. "We hope she's airworthy again soon." An airworthy Merlin engine is being shipped from the Lincolnshire Aviation Heritage Centre near Skegness and this will be fitted over the weekend.	Displays by the last two airworthy Lancaster bombers from World War Two have been cancelled after one suffered engine problems.
The X Factor's 13th series began in August with 8.5 million viewers - four million fewer than 2010's launch show. The Voice will move from the BBC to ITV next year, also on a three-year deal. But the broadcaster has agreed a deal with Simon Cowell for both The X Factor and Britain's Got Talent to continue on ITV until at least 2019. Cowell said: "I want to thank ITV for continuing to be fantastic partners. I'm delighted for the shows and, in particular, for all the talented people who work on them with us." Cowell may not appear as a judge on both programmes, though - under the new deal he is only committed to judging one of the two series per year. ITV is currently negotiating with Ant and Dec to remain as hosts of Britain's Got Talent for the next three years. Dermot O'Leary's current contract means he will keep presenting The X Factor until at least 2019. ITV's director of television Kevin Lygo said Britain's Got Talent and The X Factor were both "big, brilliant, wonderful shows" that would form "an important part of our schedule" for the next three years. "They are defining shows for us, ones that we are very proud to have as part of our entertainment slate, and they continue year after year, for months at a time, to be amongst the most popular and hugely entertaining formats on television," he said.	The X Factor is to stay on ITV for at least the next three years, despite declining viewing figures and the arrival of The Voice to the channel.
Vincent Uzomah, who is 50 years old and understood to be supply teacher, was attacked at Dixons Kings Academy at 08:55 BST. He was stabbed once in the stomach with a knife during a science lesson but is in a stable condition, police said. The teenager was arrested in the city centre following an extensive manhunt. Det Supt Simon Atkinson, from West Yorkshire Police, said the teacher was attacked in front of other students. "There were a number of pupils who witnessed this incident, which took place in a classroom, and they are currently liaising with specially trained officers who are obviously supporting them at this difficult time. "This is believed to be an isolated incident and the police are continuing inquiries to establish the facts," he said. It is thought Mr Uzomah had only been working at the school for four weeks. Police said his injuries are not life threatening and his family are at his bedside. Executive principal of the Dixons Academy group, Nick Weller, said: "It happened right at the beginning of the school day and there were some students who witnessed it. "Those students have been interviewed by the police. Obviously, it's a very shocking thing for them to see. "The general atmosphere in the school is very calm, quite orderly, we're trying to keep to normal routines as much as possible." Mr Weller said there was nothing in school that suggested the attack was about to happen. He added: "The police are looking into the lead up to this incident, there was nothing in school that led up to it. "There may have been other people outside the school who maybe knew something." He confirmed the suspect has been a pupil at the school for a year. The school, formerly called the King's Science Academy, opened in 2011 and was one of the first free schools to open. It has about 700 pupils and has since become part of the Dixons academy group. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan said violence of any kind in schools is "totally unacceptable", adding that her department is "ready and prepared to offer all necessary support". Ian Murch, of the National Union of Teachers' Bradford branch, which has members at the school, said: "Obviously people are shocked - they would be when an incident like this happens at a school. We hope it can be resolved without any more suffering or difficulties for anybody." He said the incident "does raise questions with people about safety and what can be done to improve safety".	A 14-year-old boy has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a teacher was stabbed at a Bradford school.
Charlie Dunn, from Tamworth, died in hospital after being found submerged in the Blue Lagoon area at Bosworth Water Park in Leicestershire on 23 July. Lynsey Dunn, 28, and Paul Smith, 36, who are believed to be the boy's mother and stepfather, have been charged with manslaughter by gross negligence. They are also accused of seven child neglect offences. These offences are alleged to have taken place between April 2012 and July 2016. Live updates from the East Midlands In addition, Mr Smith has been charged with two counts of witness intimidation alleged to have taken place in March 2016 and June 2017; one count of threats to damage or destroy property by fire in June 2017; and eight driving offences which are alleged to have taken place in January and June 2017. Both defendants, of Caledonian, Glascote Heath, Tamworth, appeared at Leicester Magistrates' Court earlier and are due to appear at Leicester Crown Court on 5 July.	A man and woman have been charged with the manslaughter of a five-year-old boy who drowned in a lake.
And, on emerging relatively unscathed from the deep space experiment, what Wu Shiyun thought was that he would very much like a hot bath and some seafood. He was one of four chosen to live inside the capsule, which was designed to mimic being on another planet. The experiment looked at how food and air could be used and sustained under controlled conditions. Using technology inspired by China's Shenzhou spacecraft, the three men and a woman grew 25 types of plants - including wheat and strawberries. But it was also a chance to see how four individuals - picked from more than 2,000 candidates - could live together in a space no bigger than a netball court. They also had to adjust to "Mars time", which is 39 minutes longer than an earth day. But it transpires they found one very effective way to relax: Tai Chi. "According to those of us inside the capsule, it did help in soothing our emotions. But further detailed statistical analysis is needed before we reach a specific conclusion," said Tong Feizhou, another volunteer.	Six months trapped in a tiny capsule with only three other people for company gives a person time to think.
RIT Capital announced it will not make a formal bid, after confirming reports last week that it was in the early stages of informal talks about merger. Alliance Trust invests nearly Â£3bn worth of shareholder assets. It will continue to face a fundamental review of what it does during this summer. That could still lead to a sale, or outsourcing investment to other asset management firms. And following the review, it is still possible that a deal could be done with RIT. But the announcement on Tuesday takes Alliance Trust out of the stock market's formal takeover and mergers procedures and oversight by the Takeover Panel. Activist investors last year forced a change of strategy, aimed at reducing the discount of company value to underlying assets, which involved replacement of board members and chief executive Katherine Garrett-Cox. A statement from RIT Capital said: "Following careful analysis and constructive discussions with representatives of Alliance Trust, RIT has concluded that it would not be in the best interests of its shareholders to make an offer for Alliance Trust and accordingly announces that it does not intend to make an offer to acquire Alliance Trust. "The board of RIT respects the process which Alliance Trust are going through and wishes them well with their strategic review." In response, the Alliance Trust statement said: "The board of Alliance Trust is implementing a series of changes to enhance shareholder value. This process is well under way and has already started to make good progress, lowering costs, narrowing the discount and allowing for the creation of a fully independent board of directors. "This process of development continues and includes a strategic review of the group, encompassing a broad range of potential courses of action." Alliance Trust was buying shares on the stock exchange on a daily basis, as part of its strategy to increase shareholder value. Its announcement stated that practice is to be stopped until the review is complete.	Talks about a possible takeover of Alliance Trust in Dundee by the asset fund linked to the Rothschild banking dynasty have been called off.
Police said he was armed with a stolen gun and they had been tracking him. They blamed the violence on a small group of people. Four officers have been placed on administrative leave. The wounded man's name and age have not been released by police. But the St Louis Post-Dispatch identified him as 18-year-old Tyrone Harris, having spoken to his father, the paper said. The shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson by white police officer Darren Wilson in August 2014 sparked demonstrations across the United States. Although Mr Wilson was cleared of wrongdoing by a grand jury and by the US Department of Justice, the teenager's death fuelled a national protest movement against the use of excessive force by police officers. A justice department investigation also found widespread racial bias in the Ferguson police force. What happened in Ferguson in 2014? US Dept of Justice report on Ferguson racism Earlier on Sunday, hundreds of people stood silent for four-and-a-half minutes at the spot where Michael Brown was killed, representing the number of hours that his body lay in the street unattended. The BBC's Aleem Maqbool, who is in Ferguson, says most people at Sunday's gathering felt little had changed since Michael Brown was shot dead a year ago. At the end of a sombre, peaceful day of commemorations, shots were heard at about 23:15 local time on Sunday (04:15 Monday GMT) as a large crowd gathered on West Florissant Avenue, St Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar told reporters that after "an exchange of gunfire between two groups" the suspect, believed by police to be armed, left and encountered officers in an unmarked SUV. He said the suspect fired on the vehicle and the plainclothes detectives returned fire from inside the van. There was then a further exchange of fire after the officers left the vehicle. The gunmen "were criminals; they weren't protesters," he said, adding that the officers were not wearing body cameras. Photos from the scene showed a young black man lying bloodied on the ground. He was face down and handcuffed. President Barack Obama announced a federal programme to help pay for lapel-mounted cameras for US police to record their interactions in the wake of the nationwide protests on perceived policing injustices. There have been a number of high profile shootings of unarmed black men in US cities in recent months. The most recent case involved 19-year-old Christian Taylor who was shot dead by a white police officer after he was spotted on surveillance footage vandalising cars in Arlington, Texas, on Friday.	A man has been critically injured in Ferguson, Missouri, in an exchange of gunfire with police at a rally marking the anniversary of the killing of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown.
Talk in Europe today moved swiftly from Brexit to possible Frexit (France voting to leave the EU), Swexit (that's Sweden) and more. Leaders of Europe's increasingly influential Eurosceptic parties queued up today to crow over the British vote and make political capital out of it. "It's now a reality for everyone. It is possible to leave the EU," proclaimed Marine Le Pen of France's National Front (FN), a leading contender in next year's presidential election. The mood in Brussels is resentful and despondent, while governments across Europe are scared. They feel the heat from angry electorates who share many of the criticisms of the EU highlighted during the UK's referendum campaign. That's why you've been hearing the words "EU" and "reform" of late from the nervous mouths of some you'd least expect, such as Germany's Angela Merkel and Donald Tusk, the Brussels-based President of the European Council. Because they're so worried, the EU is preparing to get tough with Britain over the terms and timing of a new trade relationship. This is not about punishment - well, not much. It's more a desire for the process to be painful to put others off exiting, while Europe's leadership tries to re-group and, perhaps, reform. But there are divisions here too that threaten to drive the EU even further apart. France rather relishes the idea of making an example of Britain. And Paris will flex its muscles far more now that the UK has voted itself out of having a voice at the EU table. But the countries of Central and Eastern Europe aren't keen to alienate the UK. They rely on Britain to support them in maintaining tough sanctions against Russia. And Poland in particular also worries about its 800,000 citizens living in the UK. Germany is somewhere inbetween. Mrs Merkel urged fellow EU leaders not to rush to conclusions about the Brexit vote as that "would only divide Europe more". She is a devoted European but she doesn't relish the idea of a resurgent France. She'll miss the UK's competitive approach to the single market, its loathing of EU protectionism and the British sense of humour she's said to be so fond of. Of course, until the UK formally notifies EU leaders of the intent to leave (which, to their irritation, could take months) everything stays the same. In theory. But next week's summit of EU leaders will be a very awkward one for David Cameron. Nothing has changed on paper yet in Brussels. But the EU has been turned upside down.	In all the years I've covered European politics, I've never seen this continent so Eurosceptic or the future of the European Union so uncertain.
John Johnston, 27, admitted taking the vehicle without consent and driving while over the legal alcohol limit. He was spotted by a CCTV operator committing the offence and stopped by police in Buccleuch Street. At Dumfries Sheriff Court he was ordered to carry out 100 hours of unpaid work and given the driving ban. Johnston, who had moved from Belfast to Dumfries, committed the offence in September this year. He had been staying in homeless accommodation in the town and took the roller from Brooms Road. He then drove it across town in a bid to get home from a night out drinking with a friend. "I was just trying to find my way home," he told the court at an earlier appearance.	A man who tried to get home on a 2.5 tonne road roller after a night out drinking in Dumfries has received a 15-month driving ban.
SP Manweb was granted permission to run 10.5 miles of overhead cables between two wind farms in Clocaenog Forest to a substation near St Asaph last year. But local action group Pylon the Pressure won the right to a judicial review. It claims the double wooden poles would be a blight on the countryside. Part of the cables would pass near the 16th Century Berain Farm, Llannefydd, which was home to Catrin o Ferain, the granddaughter of Henry VII and a prominent member of the Tudor gentry in Wales. At Monday's hearing in Llangefni, Peter Dickson, the barrister representing the appellant, argued that the cables should be placed underground near the farm. He said the option was not considered by SP Manweb and that the Secretary of State, Greg Clark, should not have granted permission. Counsels on behalf of SP Manweb will present their submissions later on. The judge has said he will reserve judgment.	A High Court hearing has begun into plans to erect a 17km line of pylons along the Denbighshire and Conwy border.
The 5ft-long (1.5m) reptile has become the talk of Pakefield, near Lowestoft, occasionally coming down for a spot of sunbathing outside the local fish and chip shop. Owner Mike Hamilton said he had tried to entice it down but his iguana was "living the life of Riley" up the tree. The "toilet-trained, ever-so friendly" pet would return when ready, he added. "He's been up there for three months now, he's enjoying himself and he won't come down," Mr Hamilton said. More on this and other news from lizard-friendly Suffolk The iguana appears to have made his home at the top of the tree and, despite taking the occasional day trip, has so far evaded capture. Rani Coleman, who works at the chip shop, said: "A customer came in one day and said there was a lizard on the floor. "We didn't believe it, but there it was, basking in the sun on the pavement." She said customers told her they had seen the "huge" iguana in various places and when she arrived at work earlier "everyone was there with their binoculars out". "I knew straight away that they'd found it," she added. The iguana is currently sitting on its tree-top perch at the end of All Saints Road, about four houses away from where it used to live with its owner. Source: Reptileexpert.co.uk Local resident Angela Hills said people were throwing fruit to try to tempt the iguana down from the tree, but she had concerns for the animal's safety as it was close to a busy road. Mr Hamilton said he did not think his "bull-headed" but harmless iguana wanted to be caught.	A pet iguana has been living up a 30ft (9m) tree for three months after making an escape from its enclosure.
McKenzie, 38, will take on Jahmaine Smyle at York Hall on 12 November for the English super-middleweight championship. The ex-Norwich and Peterborough man became a professional boxer in 2013 having quit football two years previously. He has a record of eight wins and one draw from his nine fights. McKenzie is the son of former British and European champion Clinton and is trained by his uncle, former three-time world champion Duke McKenzie.	Former Premier League striker Leon McKenzie is to fight for a national boxing title.
Britain's last world title was secured by Gail Emms and Nathan Robertson, while Chris Adcock partnered Imogen Bankier to world silver in 2011. The Adcocks are the reigning European and Commonwealth champions. "We have a good track record in Glasgow and hopefully we can get the crowd behind us and challenge for a medal," Gabby Adcock told BBC Sport. The World Championships run from 21-27 August and are being held in the venue that hosted badminton events at the 2014 Commonwealth Games. After receiving over £5m in the build-up to the Rio Olympics - where Chris Langridge and Marcus Ellis won bronze - GB Badminton was hit with the "devastating" news late last year that it would lose all UK Sport support leading towards the 2020 Games. As a result, half of the English players and support staff had to be cut from the programme in Milton Keynes. "It was tough and a massive kick in the teeth, but as athletes and support staff we'll bounce back together," said Gabby Adcock. The Adcocks, who married in 2013, remain part of a 12-strong group of English players looking to challenge for honours and despite their struggles off the court the pair claimed silver at the World Superseries Finals in Dubai and became European champions for the first time in April. "Obviously it's been a lot harder and an emotional time when people have been losing their jobs, or unable to train but on court we've channelled that into working even harder," Chris Adcock told BBC Sport. Gabby Adcock added: "Winning a medal would be huge and it's one of the wish-list to tick off. "Commonwealths was one and Europeans was another so it's now world and Olympic medals and, as we're coming into our prime over the next four years, I feel like it's definitely achievable." Chris Adcock continued: "It's been a painful time but we've moved on and even though UK Sport aren't funding us, our ambitions haven't changed." The Adcocks as well as Ellis and Langridge and Scottish Commonwealth silver medallist Kirsty Gilmour have received first-round byes at the World Championships and begin their campaigns on Tuesday.	Chris and Gabby Adcock will this week bid to become the first British badminton world champions since 2006.
Media playback is not supported on this device England have won their opening two Six Nations games and face Ireland at home on Saturday before Wales' pivotal visit to Twickenham on 12 March. "We're undefeated in three games and it sets it up a massive game for two weeks time in Twickenham," said Warburton. "Everyone knows what is on that match. It's a match the fans want to see." Wales, who are chasing their fifth Six Nations Championship since 2005, are hoping for their their first back-to-back wins over England at Twickenham since 1978. Wales won their first game at Twickenham in 20 years in Warren Gatland's first game in charge in 2008 before winning the 2012 Triple Crown at English rugby's home in 2012. And British and Irish Lions skipper Warburton added: "We got a victory there last year in the World Cup. We went there in 2012 with this same bunch of boys and won so we've had good experiences at Twickenham." George North's try and 14 points from Dan Biggar's boot eased Wales to victory over France in Cardiff, adding to their opening draw against Ireland and win over Scotland. Media playback is not supported on this device After helping to send England out of the 2015 World Cup by beating them at Twickenham, Wales return there hoping for the first back-to-back wins since 1976 and 1978 Five Nations triumphs in west London. "The England games are honestly some of the toughest Test matches I've been involved in," said Warburton. "Twickenham is one of my favourite places to play rugby. It'll be a fantastic atmosphere and the England players will be highly motivated. "You haven't seen the best of us and I don't think you have seen the best of any side in the Six Nations this season." Warburton admitted the match was so boring he expected a Mexican wave to break out in the stands "I remember thinking on the pitch 'the fans are going to start a Mexican wave in a minute - it's pretty boring'," said the Cardiff Blues flanker. "Jamie Roberts just said to me walking on the pitch 'it was an ugly way to win at Test match'. "Defences are getting better and better every year. We're trying to score nice wide tries." "It's what we work on in training week in week out, but it's one thing doing it on the training pitch and another doing it in front of a highly skilled, motivated international team. "There's not much space on the field any more and it's sometimes down to individual brilliance." But while Warburton felt the game was "boring", coach Gatland was "happy" with the win. Gatland said: "I thought it was brilliant. It's what Test rugby is all about. We defended brilliantly in the second half. "Things we had worked on looked really good for us."	Captain Sam Warburton wants a "10% improvement" in Wales' possible Six Nations title showdown against England after their "ugly" win over France.
Nottinghamshire Police were present when the man fell from a building in the Radford area of Nottingham on Friday evening. A witness told the Nottingham Post he survived the first fall before running to another flat and falling again. Police are not treating the death of the man, in his mid-30s, as suspicious. Officers were called to Waterloo Road at about 19:30 GMT.	The death of a man who twice apparently jumped from a building has been referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission.
26 January 2015 Last updated at 09:11 GMT The trees were part of an area known as 'Doggerland' which formed part of a much bigger area before it was flooded by the North Sea. It was once so big that hunter-gatherers who lived in the area could have walked to Germany, in Europe, across its land. The underwater forest was discovered by Dawn Watson and Rob Spray from Sea Search on a diving trip to study marine life. The prehistoric forest lay undiscovered until it was exposed by the extreme storms along the east of England coast in December 2013. Check out this underwater footage of the forest which experts believe could date back more than 10,000 years. Underwater diving footage is copyright and courtesy of Rob Spray and Dawn Watson.	Nature experts have discovered an amazing underwater forest thousands of years old under the sea close to the Norfolk coast in England.
The Bishop of Cork, Dr Paul Colton, is thought to be the first Church of Ireland bishop to make such a statement. Last month, the Assembly rejected a motion calling for the introduction of same-sex marriage in Northern Ireland. Dr Colton also said he hoped the church would one day recognise same-sex marriages in religious ceremonies. He told BBC Radio Ulster's Sunday Sequence programme that it was a very "divisive" debate. "The events in society are moving very rapidly and the church is not at all up to pace with the debate," he said. "I certainly support civil same sex marriage. "I also recognise that the church of Ireland's definition of marriage is for itself and I adhere to that discipline... but that is not to say that everyone must be required to take the church of Ireland's view of marriage. "Having said that I'm also among those in the church, and perhaps we're only a minority, albeit a significant one that long to see the day when we can have a discussion -  as we've had discussions over the years on all sorts of other issues about the nature of marriage -  with a view, ultimately, at least to the blessing of same sex couples following civil unions if not to their marriage in church as is happening in other parts of the Anglican communion." The Church of Ireland's LGBT affirming group, Changing Attitude Ireland, welcomed the comments. Chairman Dr Richard O'Leary said:  "The bishop's acknowledgement of the hurt that the church has inflicted on its gay and lesbian members is greatly appreciated especially as it comes on the day we are holding services to mark the International Day Against Homophobia and Transphobia (IDAHOT)". Last month,  Stormont  rejected same-sex marriage for the third time in 18 months. Northern Ireland is now the only part of the UK which has not passed a law to introduce same-sex marriage. The first gay marriages have recently taken place in England and Wales, with Scotland due to follow later this year Ahead of the assembly motion, the Church of Ireland restated its position on same-sex marriage, repeating what was affirmed at its general synod in 2012. "The Church of Ireland affirms, according to our Lord's teaching, that marriage is in its purpose a union permanent and life-long, for better or worse, till death do them part, of one man with one woman, to the exclusion of all others on either side. The Church of Ireland recognises for itself and of itself, no other understanding of marriage," it said. Catholic bishops in Northern Ireland wrote an open letter to all MLAs urging them to reject the  motion. The letter said the motion undermined the principle of equality by applying it "inappropriately".	A Church of Ireland Bishop has voiced his support for the introduction of civil marriage for same-sex couples.
Kerry Foods confirmed the redundancies, which were initially announced in February. The company said a consultation process "had failed to secure a strategy which would ensure the sustainability of production at the site". The firm said it was retaining the factory on the town's Europarc industrial estate and was looking at "future possibilities for the site". Kerry Foods said employees were given confirmation of the plant's closure on Wednesday following a 90-day consultation period. A company spokesman said: "We are doing everything we can to assist employees in securing new employment."	A Grimsby frozen food factory has closed with the loss of 337 jobs.
The 12ft-high (3.6m) statue features about 40,000 spoons and has taken almost five months to build at the British Ironworks Centre in Oswestry. The spoons have been donated from across the world, as well as local schoolchildren. It is due to be transported to Mr Geller's home in Berkshire on 28 May. It was hoped the statue could be transported to Berkshire by helicopter, but after safety fears, the Ironworks Centre said the TV production company behind Shipping Wars had stepped forward to help. By Bethan BellBBC News About 250 people toasted the unveiling of the gorilla statue in a sunny Oswestry. The British Ironworks Centre had long kept the project under wraps so there was a palpable sense of intrigue and anticipation about what a 12ft high gorilla made entirely of spoons would actually look like. Uri Geller was clearly very pleased with the end result. He even signed bent spoons for a few of the children who came along to the unveiling. While Mr Geller laid down the challenge of creating a giant gorilla, Clive Knowles, managing director of the British Ironworks Centre, said it had been built for the nation and funded by the firm. He said he was hoping the statue would ultimately live somewhere more accessible to the public and that the firm was in contact with Great Ormond Street Hospital as a possible location. Many of the spoons have been sent from as far away as China, India, Kenya, Tahiti and Armenia. Mr Geller, a friend of Prince Michael, himself donated a spoon once owned by Winston Churchill. Speaking at the unveiling, in front of a large crowd, Mr Geller described the statue as "an amazing piece of art". He said: "This will not raise money for charity. It will do something better. It will amaze sick children." "I am not going to look at the gorilla too hard in case the spoons bend," he added "It has been an amazing day and Clive has made the impossible possible. Sculptor Alfie Bradley, who has hand-welded every spoon to the statue, said he had been amazed at how the appeal for cutlery had taken off on social media. "Initially we thought we only needed 5,000 spoons, but it's incredibly hard to calculate and it turned out we actually needed 40,000," he said. "It's been incredibly repetitive, but it's been a challenge. The spoons have been different sizes, different metals." He said the project had given him "sleepless nights" and now "just the word 'spoon' is enough to drive me crazy". Mr Bradley added that the gorilla's pose, with one fist breaking out of a cage, had been inspired by the film King Kong. Due to the number of spoons donated by schoolchildren across the world, he said he had come to think of the statue as "a protector" of children. Teams from the centre have given presentations at schools in Shropshire, Staffordshire and Cheshire in an appeal for spoons, but the firm soon looked overseas. Mr Knowles said he believed the past five months had cost the firm about Â£120,000 in staff time, but described it as an "exciting rollercoaster of a ride". He said the experience had given the firm "an immense appetite to do something even better" and appealed to the public to suggest a new project that would "celebrate Britain".	A huge gorilla statue made entirely of spoons for entertainer Uri Geller has been unveiled by Prince Michael of Kent.
The UNHCR said forced returns had "continued unabated" despite an agreement earlier this month. Under the deal, any returns would be voluntary and only "when conditions were conducive". Cameroon has rejected the accusation and said people returned willingly. According to the UNHCR, more than 2,600 refugees have been forcibly returned to Nigeria from Cameroon this year. Many are unable to go back to their villages in Borno state for security reasons and have ended up in camps for displaced people. In some cases, the UNHCR said, people had been returned "without allowing them time to collect their belongings". UNHCR spokesman Babar Baloch spoke of "chaos" in the returns process and said "some women were forced to leave their young children behind in Cameroon, including a child less than three years old". Many of the returnees are now settled in the Banki camp for internally displaced people. UNHCR staff also recorded about 17 people who claimed to be Cameroonian nationals, who it said had been deported by mistake to Banki. It is common in the region to find people who have no documentary proof of their nationality. Cameroonian Communications Minister Issa Tchiroma told the BBC's Focus on Africa programme: "I strongly deny this accusation" of forced returns. He said the Cameroonian army had been working "hand-in-hand" with the Nigerian army against Boko Haram and any civilians who had returned to Nigeria had done so of their own accord. "This repatriation has taken place willingly," he said. The Cameroonian authorities have previously said Boko Haram militants have been entering the country disguised as refugees. Militants have carried out a number of attacks in northern Cameroon in recent years, often using suicide bombers. The UNHCR said forced return constitutes a serious violation of the 1951 Refugee Convention and the 1969 OAU Convention, both of which Cameroon has ratified. It called on Cameroon to honour its obligations under the conventions and continue keeping its borders open so as to allow access to territory and asylum procedures for people fleeing the Islamist insurgency.	The UN refugee agency has criticised Cameroon for the forced return of hundreds of refugees to north-east Nigeria after they had fled from the Islamist Boko Haram insurgency.
The 28-year-old Croatia international will sign the deal, which has a £109m (125m euros) buyout clause, on Friday. Rakitic - whose current contract runs until 2019 - has made 145 appearances for Barca since his 2014 move from Sevilla, scoring 23 goals. He played in Barca's famous 6-1 comeback win against Paris St-Germain in the Champions League on Wednesday.	Barcelona midfielder Ivan Rakitic has agreed a new contract, tying him to the Spanish champions until 2021.
Officials have confirmed that of the 184 inmates that escaped, 70 have been captured, leaving 114 still at large. Among those on the run is Brayan Bremer, who posted pictures of himself on the run on social media. About 100 federal officers have been sent to Amazonas to boost the search. Amazonas governor Jose Melo requested the help of the federal government on Sunday, saying Amazonas were "at their physical and psychological limit". The prisoners escaped from the Anisio Jobim jail in Manaus and the neighbouring Antonio Trindad prison as a deadly riot was under way in the former. Brazil prison riots: What's the cause? The director of the Anisio Jobim jail, Jose Carvalho da Silva, has since been suspended over allegations he took money from the Familia do Norte gang in exchange for turning a blind eye to drugs and weapons beings smuggled into the jail. Investigators say the Familia do Norte instigated the riot and specifically targeted members of rival gang First Capital Command (PCC). Mr Silva is also accused of allowing inmates to flee the prison in exchange for money. He had been put in charge of the jail on 28 December in an interim capacity, after serving as deputy head. Two inmates made the allegations against him in separate letters sent to the authorities three weeks before the riot. In the letters, the inmates say that Mr Silva had threatened to move them from a secure area of the jail into a "general population" area, even though they had received death threats and a judge had ordered they be kept separate from the general prison population. The two were among the 56 inmates killed during the riot on 1 January.	Police in Brazil are stepping up their search for more than 100 prisoners who are still on the run after escaping from adjoining prisons in the northern state of Amazonas on 1 January.
Former England skipper Terry, 36, will leave the Premier League champions at the end of the season. He captained Chelsea to an FA Cup and Premier League Double in Clement's first season as assistant to then manager Carlo Ancelotti in 2008-09. "I don't know his thinking, whether he is going to carry on," Clement said. "I will have a conversation with him. I've known him a long time." Terry made his senior debut for Chelsea in 1998, and Sunday's home Premier League game against Sunderland could be his final appearance for the club. "There's been talk in the media it could be his last game or that he will go on," Clement said. "Whether that is here in the Premier League, or whether that is abroad, that is all unsure at the moment." Swansea's Premier League rivals Bournemouth are also reported to be interested in signing Terry, should he carry on playing. Meanwhile, former France and Chelsea midfielder Claude Makelele is to become a permanent part of Swansea's coaching staff. The 44-year-old, brought in until the end of the season following Clement's appointment in January, is now set to sign a long-term deal. "All the terms have been agreed, he just needs to sign," said Clement. "We are very happy Claude is gong to be staying on. "He is very well-liked by all the staff and the players. He brings great experience of what it is like to play at a very high level. "He and all my backroom staff have been fantastic."	Swansea City manager Paul Clement says he will have "a conversation" with Chelsea captain John Terry about the possibility of signing him.
Oliver Schmidt, a former head of VW's engineering and environmental office in the US, admitted to participating in an attempted cover-up after regulators raised questions the "defeat devices". He faces up to seven years in prison, and up to $400,000 (£306,000) in fines. The scandal has cost Volkswagen as much as $25bn. US prosecutors say Volkswagen installed special software in certain diesel vehicles that allowed them to perform better during emissions tests than they did under normal driving conditions. The emissions were sometimes 30 times higher than permitted under US rules. Volkwagen sold almost 600,000 vehicles with the devices in the US between 2006 and 2015, and about 11 million globally. The allegations have also prompted probes in other countries. Volkswagen: The scandal explained VW papers shed light on emissions scandal Diesel cars: What's all the fuss about? Mr Schmidt was informed that the devices had been installed in 2015, after a nonprofit in the US exposed discrepancies and regulators confronted the company, according to court filings. Mr Schmidt, who was arrested while travelling in Miami, was one of six people charged related to the scheme in January.  The others live in Germany. The US also charged a former manager at Audi - which is part of Volkswagen - in July. A Volkswagen engineer last year pleaded guilty on related charges. His sentencing is expected later this month. Mr Schmidt, who admitted to conspiring to defraud the US and violating the Clear Air Act, is scheduled to be sentenced in December. In exchange for Ms Schmidt's guilty plea, US prosecutors dropped a charge of wire fraud. Mr Schmidt also agreed to deportation after his release. Volkswagen has agreed to pay more than $4bn in fines in the US and to spend up to $25bn to satisfy claims from owners and others. The emissions scandal in the US contributed to a wider backlash against diesel-powered cars, which were once believed to be more environmentally friendly. Four major cities have moved to ban such vehicles by 2025. Volkswagen was also recently accused of teaming up with other carmakers in a breach of EU cartel rules.	A former Volkswagen executive has pleaded guilty for his role in the German automaker's scheme to cheat US emissions requirements for diesel cars.
Tries from Macgraff Leuluai, Ah Van and Chris Bridge gave Widnes a 14-6 half-time lead, with Cas loanee Paddy Flynn responding against his parent club. Flynn scored another early in the second, but Ah Van, Lloyd White (2) and Joe Mellor tries made it 38-12. Despite three Cas tries in four minutes - Larne Patrick, Luke Gale and Flynn's hat-trick score - Widnes held on. The Vikings' victory had looked assured when Mellor took advantage of Castleford indecision on a short kick-off, running straight through to help them to a 26-point lead. But, having lost nine of their previous 10 matches, their defence creaked as they let Patrick, who has just signed a three-year deal to move from Huddersfield after his loan spell, in for a try. Gale and Flynn - on loan at Castleford from the Vikings until the end of the season - made it a nervy finish, but the Tigers suffered their fourth consecutive home league defeat. Widnes moved above Wakefield into seventh, while Castleford remain in sixth, one point above the Vikings. Castleford: Solomona, Monaghan, Crooks, Webster, Flynn, McShane, Gale, Jewitt, Milner, Patrick, Moors, McMeeken, Massey. Replacements: Millington, Springer, Tickle, Cook. Widnes: Hanbury, Thompson, Runciman, Bridge, Ah Van, Mellor,Brown, Cahill, White, Buchanan, Whitley, Dean, Leuluai. Replacements: J. Chapelhow, Manuokafoa, Walker, Heremaia. Referee: J Smith	Patrick Ah Van scored two tries on his return from a five-match ban to help Widnes to victory at Castleford.
Windsor, Slough, Eton and Hounslow Athletics Club normally use the park's famous Long Walk for winter training. The Crown Estate now said the park's ground conditions are not suitable for the club's training sessions. Coach John Higgins said: "Mo Farah used to train with the club, and he used to train exactly on this venue". "It's really sad." Mr Higgins said although the club used an athletics track for summer training, in winter it needed an outdoor venue for athletes to train on grass for cross country fixtures. The club is used by children aged between eight to 18-years-old to train, and has been running since the 1880s, with Prince Philip as its current patron. "We need somewhere lit and that's why the Long Walk is so perfect". "It's a lovely place and we're very very careful about not littering, because we respect the place," he said. Russell Young, a father of two children at the club, said: "We're extremely disappointed, we don't really cut up the grass. "We thought they'd be quite happy to have children exercising on it." The nearby playing fields of Eton, where the Thames Valley Athletics Centre is based, are not lit and have cricket pitches which could be damaged by runners, while Upton Park in Slough is not safe for the club to use at present as the pedestrian crossing is out of service following a collision with a lorry. A spokesperson for Windsor Great Park said discussions were continuing with the club to find what other options may be available for the next season.	Young runners at Olympian Mo Farah's former athletics club have been banned from training at Windsor Great Park in preparation for cross country races.
The 40ft (12m) whale was discovered by wardens at the Holkham National Nature Reserve on Thursday. The Cetacean Strandings Investigation Programme (CSIP) was contacted and a post-mortem examination is expected to be carried out. Evolutionary biologist Dr Ben Garrod said it was "really unusual" for a fin whale to be found on the east coast. For more on the whale and other stories, visit the BBC Norfolk Live page "It should not be in those waters," he said. "We see fin whales occasionally on the southern coast or more the west coast of the UK, so Ireland, right up to Scotland. "But you never get them in the North Sea so what it was doing there, we have no idea at the moment." Dr Garrod, who is based at the Anglia Ruskin University in Cambridge, said it was not yet known what killed the whale. He said: "There are no obvious signs of net entanglement, no obvious signs of boat strike, not a clue, and that's what is so interesting." The beach has remained open but Holkham Estate has urged members of the public not to venture close to the whale carcass and to keep dogs on leads. Dr Garrod also urged members of the public to show the whale respect. He said graffiti was found on the sperm whales which were washed up on the Norfolk coast in January. "I would be heartbroken to see that happen to this big, beautiful visitor to our waters," said Dr Garrod.	An expert has been left puzzled as to why a fin whale has washed up on the coast of north Norfolk.
The crash happened at Evanton at about 17:20 on Saturday. The fire service and the air ambulance was sent to the scene. The occupants of all three vehicles were injured, but the extent of their injuries was not known, police said. A spokesman added: "Inquiries are ongoing into this matter and no further witnesses are sought at this time."	Several people have been injured in a three-car collision on the A9 near Dingwall in the Highlands.
The pair stood accused of committing manslaughter and sexual violence against the exchange student. They were convicted in 2009, but acquitted two years later. The acquittal was overturned and a subsequent appeal ruling in January 2014 saw Mr Sollecito again found guilty and sentenced to 25 years in jail. But in March 2015, Italy's highest court overturned that decision - the final ruling. Last year, the police found Mr Sollecito near the Italian border and confiscated his passport. He remained free while awaiting the Supreme Court's decision. Amanda Knox, residing in the US, also had her conviction overturned. She had been sentenced to 28 years and six months. From the start of the highly publicised case, Ms Knox - who lived with Ms Kercher - became the primary focus of media attention, leaving Mr Sollecito a somewhat shadowy figure in the background. "Even though Amanda and I shared the same unjust fate, the case was always about her," the Italian wrote in his 2012 memoir Honor Bound: My Journey to Hell and Back with Amanda Knox. "I vanished so far from public view that I thought of myselfâ€¦ as Mr Nobody." The book was released after the former couple's acquittal and thrust Sollecito into the limelight for the first time. In it, he describes how he refused to cave in to pressure from his family to testify against his then girlfriend. He said his main aim had been to "save" Amanda from finishing her days in prison. "If I had changed my testimony, Amanda would have remained behind bars for the rest of her life, not just the 26 years to which she was originally sentenced. And that was something my conscience could never permit." The son of a successful urologist, Raffaele Sollecito was born on 26 March 1984 in the southern Italian city of Giovinazzo. He was on the verge of completing a computer science degree at Perugia University when he met Amanda Knox, an exchange student from Seattle, at a classical music concert in October 2007. Their encounter took place just days before Ms Kercher's death. "It was a really nice relationship," he said in an interview. "In that period she was much more at my apartment than in her one. It was an intense story, it was the start. It was crazy." It was the same flat - bought for Mr Sollecito by his parents - where Ms Knox claimed she spent the night when Ms Kercher was murdered. This contradicted reports of her initial police statement, which originally placed her at the scene of the crime. Mr Sollecito's defence was that on the night of the murder he was at home surfing the internet - although police said his computer records did not support the alibi. He has also admitted smoking marijuana at the time. Both Mr Sollecito and Ms Knox admitted a fondness for the drug - which they blamed for their inability to recall their movements on the night Ms Kercher died. In a letter to an Italian magazine he wrote: "One morning you return to her house and find a big mess. The problems begin: the police arrive, break down the locked door to a bedroom and discover the lifeless body of one of her (Amanda's) friends. From then on they suspect everyone and everything." The pair's defence was not helped by CCTV evidence leaked to the Italian press, reportedly showing them buying erotic lingerie and discussing "wild sex" barely 24 hours after Ms Kercher's death. Mr Sollecito's DNA was found on Ms Kercher's bra clasp. In the end, the jury sided with the prosecution and found them both guilty. Mr Sollecito's impassive face provided a stark contrast to Ms Knox who broke down in tears in the courtroom. Sent to separate prisons, Mr Sollecito later said of Ms Knox that her image continued to conjure up "the image of a nightmare". In letters from his cell, he wrote: "The Amanda I know... lives a carefree life. Her only thought is the pursuit of pleasure." "But," he added, "even the thought that she could be a killer is impossible for me." The pair spent four years in jail before their conviction was overturned in October 2011 on the grounds that DNA evidence was flawed. Appearing on US talk shows, Mr Sollecito revealed that he still shared "a really strong bond" with Ms Knox, whom he had visited in Seattle a few months after their release. "After she hugged me, I realised that Amanda is the Amanda that I dated for that week. She's not the Amanda that was the ghost Amanda during those four years," he said in an interview with ABC. When asked if they were still dating, he replied: "No, no - she's with another boyfriend and I am going on with my life. We are really good friends now but no, no there is nothing between us now." In July last year he distanced his legal case from hers saying that Ms Knox was not present in his house at the time of Ms Kercher's murder as she has claimed. The BBC's Ruth Alexander met Mr Sollecito in Perugia in August last year and said although he sounded exasperated at times over the accusations made against him, he only rebuffed questions about Amanda Knox. "I really don't want to make any comment or be a defence team for her," he said.	Raffaele Sollecito was 23 and about to finish his degree when he was arrested along with then-girlfriend Amanda Knox for the 2007 murder of British student Meredith Kercher in Italy.
French Europe Minister Harlem Desir called the move "scandalous" and said it raised questions about the EU's conflict of interest rules. Ex-commissioners are free to take up a new role 18 months after leaving. Despite accepting the job after 20 months, Mr Barroso has come under fire for ignoring the spirit of the rules. Mr Desir drew attention to the ill-timing of the job with Goldman Sachs. "It's a mistake on the part of Mr Barroso and the worst disservice that a former Commission president could do to the European project at a moment in history when it needs to be supported and strengthened," he told the French parliament, referring to Europe's shock after Britain voted to leave the EU on 23 June. The bank hired Mr Barroso as an adviser and non-executive chairman of its international business, with a brief of advising the bank on the consequences of Brexit. Mr Barroso has said he hopes to bring his EU experience to bear as the bank's London operation deals with Britain's imminent negotiation of withdrawal from the EU. In his new role, Mr Barroso will be able to draw on his intimate knowledge of the EU and have access to many officials and politicians he worked with at the European Commission. Mr Desir's attack in the French parliament was the latest in a sustained tirade against Mr Barroso's appointment, with some calling it "shameful". French Finance Minister Michel Sapin told reporters on Tuesday "If you have loved Europe, you shouldn't do this to it, especially not now," adding: "But this doesn't surprise me from Mr Barroso." The European Ombudsman has called for the EU to tighten rules on commissioners taking appointments after leaving office. Ombudsman Emily O'Reilly said adhering to technical rules did not absolve former staff of a wider duty to show integrity. "Any suggestion that the spirit of the law is being ignored risks undermining public trust in the EU," he said.	France has called on the former head of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso, not to take up a job advising US bank Goldman Sachs on Brexit.
Scientists used information about the geology of the country to predict the areas most likely to be affected by the poison. The report is published in the journal Science. Arsenic occurs naturally in the Earth's crust, but if it leaches into groundwater, long-term exposure can cause serious health risks. These include skin problems and cancers of the skin, lungs, bladder and kidney. Geological maps Until now, estimating the scale of arsenic contamination in large countries has been difficult. China is thought to have more than 10 million drinking wells, and each needs to be screened to establish whether any toxic compounds are present. This process could take decades. Instead, researchers from Switzerland and China looked at geological maps of the country. Dr Annette Johnson, from the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (EAWAG) and a co-author of the study, explained: "In the last few years the amount of geospatial information - electronic maps - that's become available is large. You have information such as climate data, land use, and distance to the river or elevation." Using this information, and by looking at the types of rocks present in the country, and in particular their age, the researchers pinpointed the regions where the toxic element is most likely to be found. Their findings suggest that 19.6 million people in China could be exposed to unsafe levels in their drinking water, including some living in areas areas not previously thought to be at risk. Dr Johnson told the BBC World Service programme Science in Action: "They are areas along river basins where there is irrigation and agriculture, including areas that were known previously such as the Huhhot basin in Inner Mongolia, but there are also new areas in the central Sichuan province and along the east coast." The researchers say the findings could help the Chinese authorities with their well-screening programmes. Dr Johnson explained: "What it is very important to do is to go to the areas that are hotspots and screen those first. The chances are you will find more contaminated wells than wells that are not contaminated. "And in the other areas, you still have to make sure you do screening for arsenic, but it is probably not such a high priority." Wells that are contaminated could be either treated or taken out of use, she added. The researchers believe this new prediction method could used elsewhere around the world. Arsenic contamination of groundwater is found in central Europe, South America, parts of the US and Asia. But one country that could benefit is Bangladesh, where arsenic poisoning has been described by the World Health Organization as a "public health emergency". It is estimated that between 35 million and 77 million people there are at risk of drinking contaminated water.	Nearly 20 million people in China could be exposed to water contaminated with arsenic, a study suggests.
Twenty hostages, most of them foreign, were killed when Islamist militants stormed a cafe in the capital, Dhaka. Two police officers also died and 30 were injured. After a 12-hour siege, commandos rescued 13 people. The so-called Islamic State (IS) group said it was behind the attack but the government has denied this. Bangladesh's home minister said on Sunday that the attackers belonged to a local militant group which has been banned for more than a decade. "They are members of the Jamaeytul Mujahdeen Bangladesh (JMB)," Asaduzzaman Khan said. "They have no connections with the Islamic State." Mr Khan said the men made no demands during the attack. He said three of the gunmen were under 22 and had been missing for six months. Police chief Shahidul Hoque made some of the men's first names public: Akash, Bikash, Don, Bandhon and Ripon. Bangladesh at crossroads as violence hits Is extremism on the rise in Bangladesh? Six attackers were killed in the raid on the Holey Artisan cafe in the Gulshan neighbourhood. A seventh man was arrested and is still being questioned. It is not yet clear what involvement he had in the attack. IS had earlier released photographs of the alleged attackers posing in front of a black IS flag. The men were said to belong to well-to-do local families. They studied in private schools and universities, not in Islamic seminaries or madrassas, where many Islamist militant groups are thought to draw recruits. Social media has been buzzing with former classmates who have recognised some of the attackers from their pictures, says the BBC's Sanjoy Majumder in Dhaka. Bangladesh has declared two days of national mourning. Nine Italians, seven Japanese, one US citizen and an Indian were among the dead. One Italian is unaccounted for. The JMB group has been blamed for a wave of small-scale terrorism attacks in Bangladesh over the past year, including the killings of secular bloggers, atheists and an LGBT rights campaigner. Its top two leaders were arrested and executed in 2008, after near-simultaneous bomb attacks in all the country's 64 districts. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has consistently denied that IS has made inroads in to Bangladesh. Nine Italians named by the Italian foreign ministry as: Cristian Rossi; Marco Tondat; Nadia Benedetti; Adele Puglisi; Simona Monti; Claudia Maria D'Antona; Vincenzo D'Allestro; Maria Rivoli and Claudio Cappelli Seven Japanese Five men and two women, four of whose names have been released by Japanese officials: Koyo Ogasawara, Makoto Okamura, Yuko Sakai and Rui Shimodaira Four Bangladeshis Two were named in national media as Faraaz Ayaaz Hossai, a student at Emory University in the US, and Ishrat Akhond - the other two were policemen US citizen Abinta Kabir, also a student at Emory University One Indian Tarishi Jain, 18, who was a student at the University of California, Berkeley More about the victims	Bangladeshi officials have named five of the men who on Friday carried out the country's worst terrorism attack and said they were known to police.
They're not the usual topics for a top 40 chart act, but that's exactly what alt-pop band Everything Everything have been writing about over the past year. "After we'd finished the record, I read the lyrics back and I realised I'd written a horror bible," says frontman Jonathan Higgs. He's not exaggerating. The band's third album, Get To Heaven, is mired in violence and destruction. "I'm going to kill a stranger, so don't you be a stranger," Higgs sings over a menacing electronic pulse on No Reptiles (he's playing a character, he's keen to stress). The lyrics were inspired when the Manchester band took a year off from touring, and Higgs started watching rolling news on a loop. "It all just funnelled into me day after day," he says. "It screwed me up - the violence of that year  -and it came out in the music. It became impossible not to talk about it." The story that affected him the most was that of Alan Henning - the Salford taxi driver who was delivering aid to Syria when he was kidnapped, then beheaded, by Islamic State militants. "He was reasonably local to me. An ordinary guy. A taxi driver, for God's sake. And he went out there and he was beheaded by someone else from Britain - Jihadi John. That's what was so shocking. "It really tore me up. It upset me an awful lot. I wanted to badly to understand why this guy had gone there and cut this other guy's head off. Any way I looked at it, I couldn't make sense of it. I tried my hardest and got very embroiled in it." Higgs' confusion and despair poured into a song called To The Blade, which opens the album. "His bow was his anger and his blade was this cursed time," he sings as guitars splutter and strafe beneath him. The lyrics are ugly and Higgs, who suffers from depression, admits the writing of the album affected his mental health. "I knew I was in a dark place," he says. "I was essentially trying to inhabit the minds of the [extremists] that do this stuff and saying 'could I ever do it myself?' "And the answer is yes, maybe I could. And that's a really horrible thing to face." "It's very dodgy ground to even talk about," he adds, "but if you really want to solve this thing, you can't just put it in a box and hide it under the bed and drop bombs on it and hope it goes away." The album offers no solutions, but Higgs wants it to be a call to arms. "Get involved. Don't ignore the things around you. Try to be a good person. It's simple stuff but I'm certain there's a lot of people who, like me, feel helpless and passive and lost in modern life. "I'm really only saying 'do you feel like this, too? Let's talk about it.'" To help disseminate the message, the music provides a hopeful counterpoint to Higgs' bloodthirsty lyrics. The rave chords, syncopated bass lines and soaring guitar figures are a "Trojan horse", he explains, disguising the bubbling "lava of doom" beneath the surface. But he lets slip that the "positive, bright" sound was a condition laid down by the rest of the band, who had grown concerned their singer's world view was unpalatable. When they rejected a song called Pigdog on the grounds it was dripping with self-loathing, Higgs began to agree. "The only way to contain these themes was to do it in a way that tries to escape them and rise above it," he explains. "That's where we met each other, was these pop tunes with horror beneath." The approach enabled the band to smuggle their message onto daytime BBC Radio 1, something the singer is quietly proud of. "Nobody else is doing that," he grins. "And that's something we've actually been pretty successful with in the past, too. "One of our first singles, My Kz Ur Bf, was essentially about an airstrike on innocent people but it was couched in a way that you couldn't really tell unless you listened to what I was saying. And most people couldn't tell because of the way I was singing." Ah yes, that voice. Higgs' vocals are something of an acquired taste. They flit flamboyantly between a raspy alto and the keening siren of his falsetto. One review of the new album called it "almost unlistenable" as a result - although the vast majority of critics awarded it five star ratings. The record was overseen by dance producer Stuart Price, more famous for his work with Madonna and Kylie than edgy art-pop acts like Everything Everything. "We were very worried he was going to pop-ify us or make us bland," Higgs admits. "But he got it. He really understood where we were coming from. He never suggested a softer approach." For all but the last 10 days of recording, Price worked at arm's length - receiving demos over the internet, making a few tweaks, and sending them back to the band. His contribution was a "nous about radio" and "how sound works," Higgs explains. "He can make your record sound like it's exploding out of a speaker rather than passing you by." But the band aren't necessarily aiming for number one singles and festival headline slots. "We're becoming more relaxed. We're aware that the moments we've attempted to make ourselves more palatable are the moments we've had the least success." He's talking specifically about Duet - a delicate, string quartet-assisted love song from their last album. Speaking to the BBC in January 2013, Higgs called it "one of the few proper songs I've written". But a single release failed to make the Top 100 later that year. "I thought that was going to be a huge thing for us but it really wasn't," he muses. "I don't think proper songs is where we should be going. "The bigger things for us are when we were being our weird idiot, idiosyncratic selves. "So that's where we are and that's where we're staying." Get To Heaven is released on Monday, 17 June on Sony RCA.	Ebola, missing airplanes, beheadings, the rise of UKIP.
Just minutes after leaving harbour, the ferry capsized. 193 people were killed in the tragedy. Belfast man Bill McCrea was more than 1,500 miles away in Kent, when the ship began its final journey. A chaplain for the Sailors' Society, Bill was on duty at the Merchant Navy and National Sea Training College in Gravesend. Despite the distance, news of the tragedy travelled to the college fast. "Our centre had younger trainee sailors coming through, and also older seafarers who were there to update their training. "We had three men from the Herald at the centre that night who we had to try and comfort." When Bill speaks, it's with a soft, instantly recognisable Belfast accent - a voice apparently unchanged by decades spent posted across the globe. He grew up on the Donegall Road in the city and before entering the ministry, discovered an early love for the sea. "I used to go down to the Belfast docks with my brothers and sisters to see the ships," he said. "I would say to them, 'look, see that ship? Someday I'll be a captain too'". In the end, he took to the sea as a chaplain when he accepted the role with the Sailors' Society in 1969, a position he held until retirement in 2006. In that 37-year period, the Zeebrugge disaster would become "the most traumatising tragedy that ever happened in my life". The disaster marked the beginning of months of shared grief and years of recovery, as signified by the annual remembrance service that continues with this week's 30th anniversary memorial. After the incident, Bill travelled to Dover where he spent two weeks in the Sailors' Society's Seafarers' Centre, providing support to sailors and families alike. Bill often travelled to visit those grief stricken by what happened, and also conducted the funerals of four victims. "The disaster and the subsequent weeks was a shock to my system. I have dealt with loss of life with seafarers' families over the years, but it was the enormity of this situation - so many people lost their lives that night." One funeral the chaplain presided over was for a young man who he knew from the training centre - the Herald of Free Enterprise was his first posting as a sailor. "It was his first assignment and he didn't come back. I visited his family and they were devastated. "He had just finished his college course two weeks before. I knew him well." He continued: "The first month or so (after the disaster) was hard going. In their way, actually, the families were a big support to me. "It can be difficult because families always react differently to your presence. Some are happy to have you, some will swear, some will be annoyed, some will be anti-God. "In my case, most families needed help - not so much talking, just being there. "The tragedy left people on their knees. The area of Dover was devastated, but the community came together in huge support. "I think that's what helped my visits. I was able to pray with the families, and not one refused a prayer." Among the sadness and grief, there were unlikely tales of heroism too. "I visited the wife of a man who died, she felt very guilty on top of everything else. "She had talked her husband into the trip. When the boat capsized, they were trapped. It was actually incredibly hard to escape, particularly with a lifejacket, because you were trapped at the bottom of a boat that was on its side. "She was trapped there and hypothermia set in, but there was a lorry driver beside her. He kept her alive by slapping her face and nipping her, to make sure she didn't fall asleep. "It was a nightmare situation on board." He said that surviving crew members attended funerals as part of their "shared grief". A year on from the disaster, Bill led a memorial service at the request of the victims' families. This began an annual service that the Sailors' Society has continued every year since. "Each year we've held the service and families have come. About 10 years ago, the question was asked if the service should end but the families wanted it to continue. "They've never really got over it completely. "I've never really got over it myself."	On 6 March 1987, passenger ferry the Herald of Free Enterprise pulled out of its berth at the Belgium port of Zeebrugge carrying 459 passengers and 80 crew.
The Labour leader, who is battling against challenger Owen Smith to retain his job, has said he will "rebuild and transform Britain's transport system". He pledged to offer councils new franchising powers and allow them to set up local bus companies. He also set out plans to bring railways back into public ownership to fix the present "transport nightmare". Mr Smith's campaign said all of Mr Corbyn's proposals were already Labour policy. The Labour leader promised to expand bus services to areas not currently covered, to give councils franchising powers over their bus networks, and to allow them to set up "municipal bus companies". Mr Corbyn claims the moves would save money that could be used to reverse government cuts to local bus services. Franchising powers are already to be expanded by the government's Bus Services Bill, focusing on areas with an elected mayor in place. However, the bill, which focuses on services in England outside London, rules out allowing local authorities to set up bus companies. The government says it will increase passenger numbers and "enable a thriving and innovative commercial bus sector". Mr Corbyn also highlighted his flagship pledge to renationalise the railways - a pledge matched by Mr Smith. Speaking at a protest about rail fares in London, Mr Corbyn pointed to the "pretty terrible service" run by Southern Rail in the South East of England, where passengers have held protests about train cancellations and timetable changes. He said "pretty much everyone" agreed the Southern network should be publicly-run, adding that the current model was "not a sensible way of running a public railway system that we have all paid for". Mr Smith's spokesman said his candidate would "go further" to improve transport with a Â£200bn infrastructure fund. He added: "There is nothing new in what Jeremy is saying - he is simply rehashing existing Labour Party policy." The winner of Labour's leadership contest will be announced on 24 September. Mr Corbyn has won the backing of a majority of local constituency Labour parties (CLP) in his re-election bid, securing 285 CLP nominations to Mr Smith's 53, although the scorecard has no direct bearing on the result. The leadership vote comes after Labour MPs signed a vote of no confidence in Mr Corbyn, who won an overwhelming victory among members in last summer's leadership contest. Mr Corbyn said he was "looking forward to a good result" in the contest, adding that if he won he would appoint a shadow team "that represents all of the party". Mr Smith, who has warned the "legacy of successive Labour governments" could be wiped out if the party continues along its current path, focused his campaign on the NHS on Monday. He accused the government of having "a secret plan to privatise the NHS" in England - a view rejected by the Department of Health. The two contenders will take part in a Labour leadership debate on the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme on Wednesday.	Jeremy Corbyn has pledged to extend public ownership of the country's bus networks if he becomes prime minister.
The Ayrton Light, located above the Great Bell - known as Big Ben - needs to be fully dismantled and restored. A temporary light will replace it. Installed in 1885, it was previously turned off only during both world wars. Big Ben will not chime regularly until 2021 because of repairs to the tower. The light is said to have been installed at the request of Queen Victoria, so that she could see from Buckingham Palace when members of either the Commons or the Lords were sitting after dark. It is named after Acton Smee Ayrton, a Liberal politician who was First Commissioner of Works between 1869 and 1873. It is not yet known when the light will switch off, or how long it will be off for. Big Ben will not be heard from midday on Monday. The House of Commons has said it will look again at the length of time it will be silenced after "concerns". Parliament said it had to protect workers carrying out the renovations. But Prime Minister Theresa May said "it can't be right" that the bell will not chime regularly again for four years. It will still sound for important events including New Year's Eve and Remembrance Sunday.	A lamp at the top of Elizabeth Tower - which is switched on in the evening whenever Parliament is sitting - is to stop shining for the first time in more than 70 years.
The county council plans to build 200 council homes and 300 affordable homes. The first will be built on the site of the former Custom House Lane School in Connah's Quay. Meanwhile, the nearby "old dairy" on Mold Road is being flattened along with some terraced homes on the adjacent High Street. The former dairy has stood empty for more than 30 years. The council has asked experts to draw up proposals for the site, which will be levelled and seeded once demolition work is completed in March.	Building work is due to start next month on the first new council homes in Flintshire for more than 20 years.
The Swans dropped back into the bottom three after losing to Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday - their third defeat in their last four games. Clement's side were leading 1-0 after 88 minutes but a remarkable late turnaround saw Spurs triumph 3-1. "The fact we've come out with nothing is heart-breaking," said Clement. He continued: "The players know the situation. We're in the bottom three and there are seven games to go, and West Ham [Swansea's next opponents] are a team who've had their own troubles recently so we have to go there believing we can get a result. "We need to get a result, especially in the next two games because the games are running out now." While Tottenham's stunning victory kept alive their title challenge, defeat at the Liberty Stadium was a damaging blow to Swansea's hopes of survival. Their misery was compounded by a win for relegation rivals Hull over Middlesbrough, which leaves the Swans 18th in the Premier League table and two points adrift of safety. They are five points behind West Ham, who are in 15th place, and Clement is hopeful of having top scorer Fernando Llorente back from an ankle injury in time for Saturday's game against the Hammers. "Things are very tight still. There are seven games to go and a lot of points to play for," Clement added. "We have to be encouraged by our performance for long periods of that game. The players put in a good physical effort and we have to dust ourselves off and go again - we have to be professional. "We have to know how to deal with defeat and go again on Saturday."	Swansea City head coach Paul Clement says his side are running out of time in their bid to avoid Premier League relegation.
