As night slowly begins to fall over a city's streets and highways, there is almost always an hour or two during which some cars will have their headlights on and others will not. As a general rule, if you notice the day becoming darker (even just slightly), it's a smart idea to flip your headlights on. Though you may not need your headlights to see the road during these times, other drivers may have an easier time seeing you with your headlights on (especially if the setting sun is behind you, obscuring the view of oncoming traffic).Additionally, it's important to note that in many jurisdictions, driving without your headlights on in the evening or morning can be against the law. For instance, in California, headlights must be on from one-half hour before sunset to one-half hour after sunrise (and during any other low-visibility conditions).; , As a general rule, night driving requires slower speeds than daytime driving. Because visibility is much lower at nighttime than during the day (even on well-lit urban roads), it takes longer to see and react to traffic hazards, pedestrians, and other obstacles. Since you can't control the types of hazards you'll encounter on your drive but you can control your driving, your smartest move is simply to drive slower, giving yourself more time to react to any problems you come across. You'll never want to "out-drive" your headlights — that is, to drive so fast that you can't stop within the distance illuminated by your headlights in front of you.   A good rule of thumb for night driving is: "The posted speed limit is the highest speed that's legal — not the highest speed that's safe." Don't be afraid to go slower than the posted speed limit if you can't see very far in front of you, especially if you're rounding a corner or going over a hilltop, where your visibility is further obscured. Allow other drivers to pass you as needed.  Statistically, there are almost always more drunk and overtired drivers on the road at night than there are during the day.This can have deadly consequences — for instance, in 2011, drunk driving contributed to more than four times as many accidents at night as it did during the day.Both of these conditions can dramatically lower a driver's reaction speed and lead to reckless behavior, so keep an eye out for erratic drivers on the road and give them a wide berth.   Keep in mind that weekend nights (Friday and Saturday) usually have more drunk drivers than ordinary weeknights because many people choose to start their weekend with a drink or two. Holidays can be especially bad. For instance, some analysis has shown that the early hours of January 1st can be the deadliest time of the year for drunk driving accidents., Just as you'll want to keep an eye out for other motorists who may be impaired by fatigue, you'll also want to make sure to keep your own fatigue in check. Being fatigued on the road can have many of the same risks as being drunk, including decreased awareness, slower reaction times, frequent "spacing out," weaving in and out of the lane, and so on.To fight these problems, be sure to stop frequently, giving yourself a chance to exercise, have some food and/or caffeine, and re-focus before getting back on the road.   If you're too tired to drive safely — for instance, if you're having trouble keeping your eyes open — pull over or find a rest stop and get some sleep. It's much better to be safe than sorry and the life-threatening risks of falling asleep at the wheel for just a few seconds are much more important than the inconvenience of being late to your destination.  Animals crossing the road can be especially dangerous at night. It can be very difficult to see animals ahead of you on poorly-lit roads when driving at high speeds and crashes involving large animals like deer can be deadly or cause major damage (for the driver, animal, and car). Stay vigilant when you're in places where deer or other animals are likely to cross the road (like rural areas). Pay attention to any animal crossing signs posted near the road and lower your speed appropriately. Additionally, be aware that most deer-related accidents occur in the late fall and early winter (though they can happen year-round).If you see an animal ahead of you, the smartest move is usually not to swerve. While it may be your first instinct, swerving is actually the leading cause of injuries and fatalities from deer-related accidents.Instead, lower your speed as much as you can by pressing the brakes and allow your car to hit the animal. One useful trick for spotting animals ahead of you is to look for their retinas. While it's usually difficult or impossible to see an animal's body before it comes into the range of your headlights, you can often see the light reflected in its eyes from much farther away.If you see two closely-spaced glowing dots in the darkness up ahead, slow down!  , "Spacing out" can be a big problem for nighttime drivers. To stay focused, try to keep your eyes moving while you drive. Constantly scan the road ahead of you for potential hazards. Glance to the sides of the road and check your mirrors occasionally to remain aware of your surroundings. Resist the urge to simply focus on the dividing line in the middle of the road — this doesn't give you much important visual information and can "hypnotize" you into a state of reduced awareness.The relatively quiet, calm atmosphere of most night driving and the uniformity of dark or pitch-black surroundings can combine to put night drivers into a dangerous trance-like state. Even if a driver doesn't outright fall asleep, this distracted state, which can cause lower reaction times, forgetfulness, and other dangerous problems, can be very unsafe. Always stay alert and vigilant — your life and the lives of other motorists may depend on it.  It may seem obvious, but it definitely bears mentioning that all of the safety precautions you take during the day are especially important at night. Make sure to buckle up, adjust your seat and mirrors, put away your cell phone, and focus on driving while you're behind the wheel. These simple, everyday precautions make driving safer and accidents less likely, day or night.  Your headlights are your most important lifeline when driving at night. If they're not in good working condition, you're essentially increasing your risk of an accident for nothing. Keep your headlights clean by washing them every few weeks — this should keep their brightness and clarity high. If a headlight burns out, replace it as soon as you can during the day and avoid driving at night until you can do so. Note that it is often illegal to drive without proper working headlights.   In addition, for top visibility, you'll want to keep your windshield, windows, and mirror as clear and clean as you can. Avoid using your hand to wipe these important parts of your car — the natural oils of your skin can leave obscuring smudges. Instead, use a newspaper or microfiber towel.  Your car's high-beam lights can seriously boost your safety while driving at night, but only if you use them correctly. High-beams should be used when driving in very dark, low-visibility areas where there is not much traffic. In these cases, high-beams can make your field of vision much wider and deeper, so use them as needed.   Be sure to turn off your high-beams when following another car or there is oncoming traffic. In these cases, the bright light of the high-beams can distract other drivers, making it harder for them to drive safely. If you're rounding a corner or going over a hilltop and you start to see the faint glow of another car's headlights from around the bend, turn your high-beams off in advance so that the other driver isn't suddenly blinded.  Sometimes, a car's headlights are angled lower to the ground than is necessary or aren't aligned perfectly symmetrically. The brightest headlights in the world aren't useful if they're not properly angled to illuminate as much of the road in front of you as possible, so if you're having a hard time seeing ahead while driving at night, you may want to consider having your headlights re-adjusted. At a professional mechanic's shop, this procedure is usually quite quick and cheap.   It's also possible to adjust your headlights yourself. Since every car is different, if you want to do this, be sure to follow the instructions in your car's owner's manual. Be patient — it can take some time to get a set of headlights aligned perfectly., In a perfect world, other drivers would always dim their high-beams when they see you, just as you would for them. Unfortunately, drivers don't always remember to do this. If an oncoming car has its high-beams on, avoid looking at them, as their bright light can momentarily blind you. Instead, glance to the right hand side of your lane (or, in countries that drive on the left side of the road, the left) while keeping your peripheral vision alert to hazards. This keeps you as alert of the hazards around you as possible while preserving your vision.   If a car behind you is using its high-beams, try adjusting your rear view mirror to keep the light out of your eyes. You can even move the mirror to shine the light back at the driver and alert him to his mistake., If you anticipate doing lots of driving at night and in foggy conditions, you may want to consider investing in a set of after-market fog lights. Often, these lights are mounted low on the front bumper to illuminate as much of the road ahead as possible (fog often is thinnest in the foot or so just above the road).However, not all after-market lights are created equal, so talk to an automotive expert before making this purchase.   Never use your car's default high-beams in the fog. The reflective water particles that make up fog can shine the bright light back at you, obscuring your vision of the road more than if you had used no lights at all.  Other cars' headlights (and especially high-beams) can pose unique challenges to drivers with glasses. Glasses can sometimes reflect oncoming lights in ways that create an obscuring glare for the wearer. To avoid this, try wearing contacts or buying a set of glasses that use an anti-reflective coating, which should minimize these effects.If you do buy a specialty pair of glasses, keep them in your car so that they'll be available to you whenever you go driving.  Once you've mastered the fundamentals of safe night driving, the experience can actually be a fun, relaxing one, especially if you make the most of entertaining opportunities that also help you drive safely. For instance, if you have a passenger in the car with you while you're driving at night, you may want to partially engage yourself in a light conversation with him or her. Talking to other people is a great way to stave off driving fatigue, and the calm, pitch-black surroundings can often encourage surprisingly intimate conversations.   Be sure, however, not to engage yourself too heavily in the conversation. Getting into a heated argument, for example, can distract you from the most important task at hand — driving safely.  Driving at night can be a fantastic time to listen to your favorite music on your car's stereo. The relative quiet and calm of night driving makes it easier to hear a song's minor details, making good music especially enjoyable. Some people prefer to listen to slick disco or electronica cuts at night, while others appreciate the thrill of hard rock tracks. There's no "right" type of music to listen to at night — it's up to you! Below are just a few great night driving tracks from several different genres (there are many, many more):   Kavinsky - "Nightcall" Chromatics - "Back From the Grave" DJ Shadow - "Midnight in a Perfect World" Kyuss - "Gardenia" Allan Kingdom - "Evergreens" Golden Earring - "Radar love" Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick, and Tich - "Hold Tight" Quiet Riot - "Party All Night" Daft Punk - "Contact" Charles Mingus - "Moanin'"  , Driving at night can sometimes be a way to come into contact with people and things that you wouldn't otherwise see! For instance, most major city centers truly "come to life" at night and bustle with unique characters enjoying the night life. Even rural areas can have their share of unique late-night "flavor". Every stretch of road is different, so keep your eyes peeled for attractions as you drive — if you're taking lots of breaks to fight night-driving fatigue, you should have ample opportunities to stop. Below are just a few things you may want to look out for:   Late-night diners/hang-outs Bars and nightclubs (note: avoid drinking and driving, especially at night) Truck stops/rest areas Scenic paths and overlooks Camp grounds Drive-in attractions (theaters, restaurants, etc.)  , Driving at night can be an experience like no other. With the calm, steady hum of the engine and the darkness of your surroundings, driving can be almost like flying through space. Driving at night feels mysterious, fun, and even exciting — for some people, it's one of life's simplest yet most addictive joys. It's perfectly fine to enjoy a good night drive, but don't forget to focus on what's most important of all — your safety and the safety of other drivers. Always remember that getting distracted while driving can be deadly (especially at night), so keep your attention on the road. If you're confident in your safe driving habits, you'll be able to responsibly relax, tune in, and enjoy your ride!	When in doubt, turn your lights on. Slow down. Be wary of drunk and tired drivers. Take frequent breaks to fight fatigue. Watch for animals, especially in rural areas. Keep your eyes moving. Take all normal daytime driving precautions. Keep your headlights, mirrors, and windshield in top condition. Use your high-beams for low-light situations. Consider adjusting your headlights. Deal with others' high-beams by glancing to the side of the road. Consider adding low-to-the-ground fog lights. If you wear glasses, use an anti-reflective coating. Stay awake by talking to a passenger. Listen to night-driving tunes. Visit late-night attractions. Enjoy the calm (responsibly).
Burning is a good way to remove the stump after you have killed it. Start by drilling plenty of holes across the surface of the stump. The holes should be about 1⁄2 to 1 inch (1.3 to 2.5 cm) wide and at least 8 inches (20.3 cm) deep, or 12 inches (30.5 cm) if you have a long enough drill bit. Penetrating deeply will ensure the stump gets burned down to the tips of the roots so that it will be easy to remove.  Soaking the stump with kerosene will enable you to light it on fire so it will burn into ash. Make sure the stump is fully saturated, or the fire may go out before it reaches the tips of the roots.          Another option is to place charcoal on top of the stump and light the charcoal on fire. The coals will slowly burn down through the stump. This method will reduce the chances of burning nearby plants. If you're worried about nearby objects catching fire, you shouldn't use this method. You're going to be setting the stump on fire, and while it's quite effective, it can be dangerous if you don't have plenty of room around the stump. Check local city ordinances to make sure it’s legal to do a controlled burn. Call 411 to find out more information.  Put scrap wood on top of the stump and use a fire starter to ignite it. As the fire burns down, the stump will catch and burn up. Look closely to make sure the stump actually catches, and add more wood as necessary to keep the fire going.         Be sure to monitor the stump as it burns to ash. Don’t leave it unattended, in case the fire gets out of hand. Depending on the size of the stump, the burn may take several hours.  Use a shovel to remove all of the ashes, down through where the roots were, and fill in the hole with fresh soil.	Drill holes in the stump. Pour kerosene into the holes. Build a fire on top of the stump. Dig out the ashes and fill in the hole.
There are a number of products designed specifically to clean your tires. Spray tire cleaner onto your tires and follow the directions regarding how long to leave it on.Car wash soap is designed to clean and protect paint and clear coat, not rubber, so it can leave a film over your tires or prevent them from shining. Just as car wash soap does a poor job of cleaning tires, tire cleaner can have a negative effect on the paint of your vehicle. Do your best to avoid getting any on the paint. There are some cleaners designed for use on both wheels and tires. If you did not purchase cleaner designed for both applications, avoid getting tire cleaner on your wheels.; , Because rubber is a fairly porous surface, it can be difficult to get the grime and brake dust off of your tires. Allow the tire cleaner to sit on the tire for a minute or two, so it can soak in and dislodge as much dirt and grime as possible.Follow the instructions regarding how long to let the tire cleaner sit on the tire for optimal effect. Wipe any overspray on the wheels or paint off immediately with a clean rag.  If your tires have a white film or have browned due to deposits of grime, you may need to scrub them to get them clean. Use a brush with fairly stiff bristles and don’t be afraid to apply a lot of pressure when scrubbing your tires clean for the best results.It does not matter if you scrub your tires in a back and forth or circular motion as long as you are consistent throughout the tire. Use a stiffer brush than you would on paint, but avoid steel tooth brushes as they may penetrate the rubber and lead to leaks.  After scrubbing as much grime off of the tire as you can, use a hose to rinse the tire off. Use a power washer or high pressure hose if possible to limit the amount of dirt that remains on the tire.Tire cleaners are designed to be environmentally safe, so it’s fine to allow the tire cleaner and water to drain or run off into your yard. Be sure to wear eye protection if using a pressure washer.  After scrubbing the tire with tire cleaner on it and rinsing it off, there may still be a white or brown film left on the tire. Reapply tire cleaner and allow it to set again, then scrub and rinse the tires a second time to remove as much road grime as possible.Read the instructions on the tire cleaner you purchased. Some may specify that they should be applied to dry rubber. If that is the case, wait for the tire to dry before reapplying. Repeat the cleaning and scrubbing process as needed for your desired level of clean.  If your tires are still brown after a thorough cleaning, you may choose to use a tire gel to return the rubber to its original shade of black. There are a number of types of tire gel, but most are applied with a sponge to the entire sidewall of the tire. Apply the gel and then rinse it off one tire at a time to avoid letting it dry out on the tire.Tire gels can undo rubber browning from age. It is best to apply tire gel to an already cleaned tire.	Use a cleaner designed for tires. Allow the cleaner to sit for a minute. Use a stiff brush to clean tires. Rinse the tires with a hose. Repeat the cleaner process if necessary. Use tire gel for browned tires.

Greens with dark leaves (such as spinach) and many root vegetables (such as carrots and beets) tend to work well as food dyes because they have deep, consistent, opaque coloring. Your natural food dyes will be most effective if you choose veggies that are mostly one color throughout (and which have a color that is bright or deep).Some vegetables may seem like good candidates for natural food dye, but if they have high water content (as does celery) they will actually produce very weak, light shades. Many vegetables (even those with vibrant coloring) lack the thick, concentrated juices produced by many fruits. In general, do not expect vegetable-based food dyes to be as bright or even as those made from berries. Beets (for red) and carrots (for orange) are exceptions to this rule.; , Some vegetables leach color into the water when boiled. The vegetables that work best for this are those with lots of water content (and therefore juices) that are also deeply hued. Red cabbage (for purple) and beets (for red or pink) are two great examples of vegetables that can be boiled to extract their coloring.For a more concentrated color, only use as much water as is needed to barely cover the vegetables. The colored water becomes the dye -- the more you dilute it, the lighter the shade. A good rule of thumb for figuring out which vegetables produce the best colors is that those that stain your fingers when handling them will also easily dye the foods with which they come into contact.  Use a food dehydrator or set your oven to 150 degrees Fahrenheit and place the item(s) inside on an oven-safe tray. Cook them until they are as dry as possible (without becoming burned); this could take up to six hours.For large vegetables (especially sphere shaped ones), cut them into extremely thin slices before dehydrating them. This will speed up the process and dry them more consistently. Once dried, your vegetables can be safely stored in an airtight container for several months to a year.  Use a coffee grinder or food processor to do this most efficiently. The finer the powder, the less the dye will affect the texture of the food you wish to color.You can also use a mortar and pestle to grind the veggies by hand, but this will take much longer and could result in less even consistency. Thoroughly rinse off any utensils you use to make the powder before using them to grind up a different color of dried food. This will keep you from contaminating the color and flavor (if any) of your next veggie powder.  Many vegetables/herbs can be purchased in dried, powdered form, which eliminates the need to do the drying and grinding yourself. Just be sure to select those without added spices or flavoring so you don't influence the flavor of the food you wish to color.   If you are not worried about watering down your food, you can mix the powder into a small amount of water or other liquid and then stir this into the food. Do this gradually to achieve the right color and avoid over-saturating your food. For yellow dye, use stale turmeric. Turmeric is often used to give vegan puddings and tofu scrambles their "eggy," yolk-like shade. Stale turmeric tends to have lost quite a bit of its natural flavor, so use this to avoid influencing the taste of your colored food.	Choose vegetables with consistent coloring. Boil your vegetables. Dehydrate your vegetables or herbs. Grind the dried veggies into a powder. Select foods that are already in powder form.
Different drums are available for beginner players and for more advanced drummers.   A beginner bongo is smaller and does not weigh as much as drums made for more skilled players. A bongo for an advanced drummer is typically more expensive due to better quality heads and rims and more ornate design.; , The difference between the 2 materials is the tone of the sound of the drum. When it is played, a fiberglass drum offers a bright pop, while a wooden drum sends out an earthly, hollow sound.    When deciding on a rawhide skin to purchase, hold it up to the light. Look for an evenly colored skin, which indicates a skin of uniform thickness. Color variations can suggest the skin is not the same thickness all the way across, which affects the sound quality of the particular skin. Since weather affects rawhide heads, expect changes in tone as the weather changes, and plan on spending more time tuning the head. Warmer weather tightens the head and produces a higher pitch. Synthetic heads are mass produced of man-made materials and provide a consistent and smooth playing surface. Changes in weather do not affect synthetic heads. Synthetic heads offer a convenience above rawhide heads in that they come already stretched and tucked onto a frame and are ready to mount to the drum and play.    Synthetic heads are typically pre-fitted. Pre-fitted heads are convenient to replace quickly. They are not affected by humidity, altering the tuning and sound of the head, as rawhide heads are. Flat heads give you the decision power of the exact rawhide you want for your drum and the satisfaction of tucking it on your own. If you use flat heads, you will have to learn how to tuck heads, and then each time you tuck one, you will have to wait to play the bongo until the head dries.    The size of the drummer can direct you to the size of bongo you purchase. A smaller drum set better accommodating a person of smaller stature. Sound preference can be instrumental in determining the size of your bongos. Smaller drums offer a higher pitched sound, while the sound of drums with larger heads is deeper.	Purchase a bongo based on your skill level. Choose between a wood drum or a fiberglass drum. Select whether you would like synthetic or rawhide heads. Select the style of head you want: flat or pre-fitted. Pick the size of bongo that suits you.
Look for signs of an approaching train. You should see signs, like a sign with an X and RR written on it. Check for flashing lights, a person signaling a train, and a horn or bell from an approaching train. Even if there are no signs of a train, slow your bike. Crossing tracks at full speed on a bike can be dangerous.Make sure you are in the appropriate spot for a bike. The laws may state that bikers stay on the road, or on a specific bike path.  If there is a train, you should stop your bike completely and wait. Do not try to race across the track before the train approaches. Either continue sitting on your bike, or get off your bike and stand next to it while holding the handle bars. Wait until the train has passed. Make sure another train is not coming. You are able to cross the tracks when the lights have stopped flashing, and the crossing gate has been lifted., There are several risks you are taking when crossing railroad tracks on a bike. Knowing the risks before crossing the tracks will help prevent you from falling or becoming stuck on the tracks. The risks include falling into the gap next to the rail, falling in a gap near the tracks, and sliding on the tracks. The way you cross the tracks depends on what risks your perceive before crossing., Falling into the gap perpendicular to the rail happens because sometimes railroad crossings use coverings to make the railway smoother, but the coverings are made up of individual pieces that leave gaps. The gaps are often wider than a bike tire, which risks the bike tire falling into the gap. To avoid this, cross the tracks close to a 45 degree angle, instead of perpendicularly.   Judge what is a 45 degree angle by using the outermost tracks as your basis for the bottom line of the angle.  Sliding happens on the tracks when they are slippery and/or wet. Avoid leaning the bike on slippery tracks. Instead, cross the tracks in a straight line. Try to go as slowly as possible when crossing.  Do not try to line your bike up with the tracks. If your bike tires are narrow, do a slight S weave on the tracks, between 20 and 70 degrees. It is also an option to get off of your bike and walk it across the tracks.You can “hop” across the raised tracks on your bike if you are an experienced bike rider. Do not attempt this if you do not know how to jump with a bike. It is dangerous and could lead to a crash if you are not experienced.	Slow your bike when approaching railroad tracks. Wait for the train to cross. Know the risks of crossing the tracks on a bike. Go over the tracks at a 45 degree angle. Cross the tracks in a straight line. Cross the tracks safely.
For variety, choose two different colors of paper, or even pick several different colors. Pick colors that are appropriate to the season or occasion -- red, green, and yellow for Christmas, or pastel colors for a baby shower or bridal shower.; , Use a sturdy pair of scissors to cut equally-sized strips of paper from each piece of paper. You can adjust the size a bit according to your preference -- adjusting the width of the strips will make the garland loops wider and adjusting the length will make the loops longer.  Simply create a loop by making the flat strip round, and touching the edges of the paper so that they are overlapping by at least 1 inch (2.5 cm). The most dependable way to make the strip stay in loop form is to glue the ends of the strip together and wait for the glue to dry before you move on. But if you don't have the time or patience to individually glue each garland, you can also tape the loops together using clear masking tape.          If you're really pressed for time, you can even staple the ends of the loops together twice. Remember that if one loop falls apart, the garland will disconnect.  Now take another strip of paper and run it through the first loop until you connect the ends of that strip to form a second loop. Connect the ends of the second loop just as you did with the first loop. If you're going for alternating colors, make sure you pick a different color for the second loop.  Continue running each strip of paper through the previous loop and then connecting it to make a loop until you've connected all of your loops and have created a paper garland of interlocking loops. If you'd like your garland to be a bit longer, just cut more strips of paper and create more loops until you're satisfied with the length.  Once your garland has been created, all you have to do is hang it up. You can drape the garland over a tree, a back patio, a column, or any piece of furniture. If you want to hang your garland up on the wall, hang the loops over a sturdy protruding nail.	Gather at least 10 pieces of construction paper. Cut at least 3 strips of 2.5 inch by 10 inch (6.3 cm by 25.4 cm) paper from each piece of paper. Form one strip of paper into a loop. Connect another loop with the first loop. Repeat this step until you've connected all of the loops. Hang up your garland.
If the non-rubber blade and arm parts are still in good condition, it goes without saying you won’t need to replace them. But sometimes the rubber breaks down faster than non-rubber parts (especially in sunny areas).Remove and replace the rubber blade inserts., Pull the metal arm away from the windshield. Where the blade attaches to the arm, you should see a joint. On this you’ll find a release for the arm. Open the release, take out the old blade, insert a new one, and reset the release.On some cars, there may be a push-tab or tension hook attaching the blades to the arm assembly. Release these kinds of fasteners with your hands and slide off the blade. Depending on who you ask, you might hear that you should change your blades every six months or once a year, but it’s always a good idea to before the rainy season., Follow the wiper blade down the arm to its base. You should see a nut sticking up from this point. Remove the nut with a wrench. Now you can pull the arm off. Fit a replacement arm into place and fasten the nut and your new assembly is good to go.With time and use, the assemblies holding your wiper blades in place can become misshapen or inflexible, contributing to squeaking.	Install new rubber inserts. Replace your wiper blades regularly. Replace the wiper assembly.
You may remove the cabinet doors entirely if the hinges are visible or if they are easily removable. This will allow you to paint the cabinet face and shelving thoroughly and separately with little mess.; ,, Apply the chemical carefully per the manufacturer's instructions. Once clean, rinse all surfaces thoroughly with fresh water and allow the laminate to dry completely before proceeding.  You will want to create a rough enough surface for the paint to stick to, so ensure that all surface areas are well scuffed. Once you are finished sanding, clean all of the dust away by first vacuuming the surfaces and then wiping them with a clean, damp cloth. Again, allow the laminate to dry completely before proceeding.  You can purchase an appropriate primer at most hardware stores. Allow the primer to dry completely per the label instructions.  Oil-based paints provide a smoother finish and are easier to clean, so they are the better choice for kitchens and bathrooms. Apply paint with a roller to avoid leaving brush strokes on the laminate surface.	Remove all visible hardware from the cabinets, including knobs and pulls.Cover any un-removable hardware with painter's tape  , Clean all laminate surfaces thoroughly with a de-greaser, such as tri-sodium phosphate. Sand all laminate surfaces with 120-grit sandpaper. Apply a specifically formulated laminate primer per the manufacturer's instructions. Apply a latex or oil-based paint of your choosing over the cured primer. Replace all hardware and rehang the cabinet doors once the paint has fully dried.
Be sure to choose your size and material wisely.   Avoid choosing a fabric that is to sheer or flimsy, unless you intend to make a sturdier lining. Avoid using a piece of fabric that is too big, but you can always cut it to size. Avoid using a piece of fabric that is too small.; ,, If your fabric has a "right side" and a "wrong side," make sure that the right sides will end up on the outside of the pouch.  If you want to, you can include a clasp or closure. At this step, you could also decorate and personalize your pouch.	Get a piece of fabric. Fold the fabric in half.  , Use a hot glue gun or sew the fabric together. Add a handle if you wish. Fill your pouch with anything you may please.
For much of the film, Burton’s Alice wears a blue dress that falls close to ankle-length. In some scenes her blue dress is loosely draped and worn off the shoulder. However, in the court scene she wears a strapless red tea-length dress with white and black sheer overlay.   Adults may own a suitable red cocktail dress. The loosely draped version of the blue dress would be difficult to buy or construct, but could be appropriate as an informal toga-style costume. Vintage stores and thrift shops can be good places to find affordable longer dresses that can be modified to look like Alice's film costume.  In the film, Alice does not wear the iconic white pinafore. However, the overlay on the red dress is something like an apron worn backwards; open at the front, covering the back.   You can make your own reverse pinafore by tying a length of black and white fabric across the back of a red dress, and draping part over one shoulder.  In the film, Alice wears white-tinted stockings but they are sheer and not terribly distinctive. In warm weather, going without stockings would likely be as appropriate as wearing nylons.  Burton’s Alice wears white lace-up boots with a kitten heel and a black toe. These might be quite difficult to find.   Black and white saddle shoes might provide a convincing alternative. Some websites that feature vintage imitation clothing, such as Modcloth, stock high heels in black and white that look similar. Purchasing a pair of white boots from a thrift store and painting them with black accents is an affordable alternative.  Alice’s hair is blonde and parted down the center. It falls in loose waves around her shoulders without a headband or other styling.   If your hair is naturally straight, use a curling iron or hot rollers to achieve more body. If your hair is naturally a color or texture that makes imitating the film look impossible, consider wearing a wig to achieve the full effect.	Pick a dress. Decide whether to use a pinafore. Choose your stockings. Find the best footwear. Style your hair.
For example, some cars have hand controls but no wheelchair access for passengers.   Decide if the disabled person will be driving or requiring a surrogate driver. If you need a rental car without wheelchair access or a swivel seat and there is a surrogate driver, the rental car company is likely to rent you a regular car and waive any driver fees by special arrangement. Determine if you need wheelchair access. People with wheelchairs may need a transfer board and an easy access bus. Vans and mini-buses are generally the only vehicles that come with wheelchair access, and there is very limited availability at major rental car companies. If the handicapped person is trained in driving with hand controls, rental car companies usually carry a limited number of vehicles that use left or right hand controls. You should also ask about a panoramic mirror for easier views and a spinner knob that helps the driver to control the wheel with a single knob. Determine if any handicapped drivers or passengers need a swivel seat to get in and out of the vehicle. These are often removable and available by request.; , Most airport websites have a list of the car rental companies that are available to its patrons.  You will need to call the company directly, instead of using travel aggregate sites like Expedia, Travelocity or Hotwire.   In busy airports and during vacation or high-season travel times you should call 1 to 3 months in advance to reserve your handicapped rental car or van.    You do not need to explain all the details of the person's disability, merely what you will need in order to rent from the company.  Most rental car agencies will require you to bring the driver's license as proof of age and the ability to drive.   A disabled person who is over the age of 25 can rent a car with a surrogate driver without a driver's license. The surrogate driver will need to be over the age of 25 with a valid driver's license. Ask if your car or van may has a handicapped accessible license plate. If not, you may need to bring your dashboard disability sticker. , Before you book, it is important to ensure they will be able to transport you to and from the rental car location in a handicapped accessible shuttle or van.  If not, you can call a wheelchair accessible van rental agency.   Accessible Vans of America, Wheelchair Getaways, Wheelchair Vans and Wheelers rent handicapped accessible vans exclusively from their websites. Specify your location and travel dates to see what availability they have.  You should be clear about what services will be provided, such as a shuttle, before you place the reservations.  Few rental car companies will charge you in advance; however, they will require a credit card in case of a late cancellation.	Determine what type of car is necessary for the needs of the handicapped person who will be using the car. Look up the airport or location where you will be arriving. Call rental car companies, like Avis, Hertz and Enterprise at least 48 hours before you arrive. Tell the customer service agent what equipment you will require in your rental vehicle. Ask what proof of disability is required upon check in. Call additional rental car agencies in the area if you are unable to find a van or car for the dates you are traveling.  , Ask what services the rental car agency will provide for pick up and drop off at an airport. Decide if a rental car company will provide what you need in a wheelchair accessible vehicle. Call to speak to a customer service representative if you have any questions. Reserve your wheelchair accessible van or car with a credit card.
It's very important for a budding autobiographer to document their life regularly. Journals, videos, photographs, and mementos of the past will be extremely helpful for you as you start walking down memory lane. We often remember things incorrectly, or struggle to remember specifics, but objects can't lie. Photos will tell you the truth. Your journal will always be honest.   If you don't already, start keeping a detailed journal of your day-to-day life. The best way to give yourself a reliable record of what was going on in your world and in your head is to keep a journal every night before you go to bed. Take lots of pictures. Imagine what it would be like to have forgotten what your best friend from school looked like, and not have a picture of them. Pictures will help jog memories later and provide a helpful record of places and events. They're essential for autobiographers. Video can be especially moving to look back on. Seeing the way in which you've aged on camera, from youth to adulthood, or seeing an old family pet living and moving around can be a powerful experience. Take lots of video over the course of your life.; , To start collecting notes and start working on an autobiography or memoir, it can be instructive to talk with other people. You may feel like you've got a good sense of yourself and your "story," but other people may have a very different version of you than you think. Ask them for their sincere impressions by conducting one-on-one interviews and recording them, or even writing up a survey and letting others fill it out anonymously. Ask specific questions of your friends, family, and acquaintances:   What is your strongest memory of me that i cannot forget? What is the most significant event, achievement, or moment of my life? What's a time you remember me being difficult? Have I been a good friend? Lover? Person? What object or place do you most associate with me? What would you want to say at my funeral?  , One excellent way of looking for meaning in a life and finding a motivation to start writing can be found in the past. Get in touch with distant relatives you might not have previously related with, and visit locations in your past that you might not have visited in a long time, if at all. See what's become of your childhood home. Go find the old park where you used to play, the church where you were baptized, the place your great-great-great-grandfather is buried. See it all.If you're the child of immigrants, it can be very moving for many people to visit the birthplace of your family, if you haven't already. Arrange a trip to the homeland of your ancestors and see if you identify with the place in a way you hadn't before. Try to get a sense not only of the story of your life, but the story of your family's life. Where did they come from? Who were they? Are you the child of cattle ranchers and steel workers, or the child of bankers and lawyers? On what side did your ancestors fight in an important war? Has anyone in your family been to prison? Are you the descendant of knights? Royalty? The answers to these questions can make for powerful discoveries.  Don't just look through your own documents and memorabilia, look through the leavings of your ancestors. Read their letters back and forth, written during wartime. Read their journals and diaries, making copies of everything to archive the objects safely, especially if you're dealing with delicate documents that are very old.   At the very least, it's a great idea to look through old photographs. Nothing can jog stronger emotions and powerful nostalgia quicker than seeing your grandparents wedding day, or seeing your parents as children. Spend time with old photographs. Every family needs a reliable archivist, someone who takes charge of looking over the family's documents. If you've got an interest in digging around in the past, start taking on this responsibility. Learn everything you can about your family, your history, and yourself.  Lots of nonfiction books are planned beforehand, plotting an exciting change in your life, travel, or project to document with a book. It can be a great way to generate material. If you're worried that not much exciting has happened to you in your life, consider making a big change and writing a proposal to get it funded.   Try being a fish out of water. If you're a city-dweller, see what would happen if you moved to the country for a year and decided to eat only food that you could grow. Spend a year researching farming methods and homesteading skills, propose the project, and strap on your gardening gloves. You could also travel to a turbulent location, getting a gig teaching overseas, somewhere exciting and unfamiliar to you. Write about your experience being there. Try to give something up for a long period of time, like throwing away your garbage, or eating processed sugar, and document your experience of this experiment. If you have an exciting enough proposal, lots of publishers will advance you some money and a contract if you've got a good track record of publishing, or if you've gotten a really great idea for a non-fiction project.  Before you get started on your own, see how other writers have approached the task of recording their lives in print. Some of the best writing comes from writers taking on the challenge of their own lives. Some classic autobiographies and memoirs include:    Townie by Andre Dubus III  I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings by Maya Angelou  The Autobiography of Malcolm X by Malcolm X and Alex Haley  Persepolis: The Story of a Childhood by Marjane Satrapi  A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius by Dave Eggers Life" by Keith Richards  Me by Katherine Hepburn  Another Bullshit Night in Suck City by Nick Flynn  , The hardest thing about writing an autobiography or memoir is in finding the core of your story. At the worst, an autobiography can be a rambling series of boring details, flying by whole months and years without any interesting or specific details to hold up the story for itself. Or, an autobiography can elevate mundane details to feel important, profound, and grave. It's all got to do with finding the emotional core of your story and keeping it at the forefront of your story. What is your story? What is the most significant part of your life that needs to be told?   Picture your whole life, as you've lived it, like a beautiful mountain range off in the distance. If you want to give people a tour of your mountains, you could rent a helicopter and fly over it in 20 minutes, pointing to little things in the distance. Or you could take them on a hiking trip through the mountains, showing them the nitty-gritty, the up-close, and the personal. That's what people will want to read.  If you're struggling to find the relatable part of your life, start thinking of big changes in your life. What's the difference between the way you used to be and the way you are now? How have you grown up? What obstacles or struggles have you overcome?   Quick exercise: Write up a short one-page portrait of yourself 5 years ago, 30 years ago, or even a couple of months ago, if necessary–however long you need to account for a significant change in yourself. What would you have been wearing? What would have been your major goal in life? What would you have been doing on an average Saturday night? In Dubus' Townie, the author recounts what it was like growing up in a college town, where his estranged father worked as a successful and famous novelist and professor. He, though, lived with his mother, doing drugs, getting into fights, and struggling with his identity. His transformation from being an out-of-control, anger-obsessed "townie" to a successful writer (like his father) forms the core of the story.  Every good story needs a strong supporting cast of other characters to round out the narrative. Although it's your life that will form the main structure and focus of the autobiography, nobody wants to read a self-absorbed rant. Who are the most important other characters in your story?   Quick exercise: Write up a one-page character sketch of each member of your family, focusing on questions you've asked of yourself, or asked others about yourself for research. What is your brother's most crowning achievement? Is your mother a happy person? Is your father a good friend? If your friends are more significant in your autobiography than your family, focus more on them. It's important to keep your list of main characters as small as possible, and "blend" characters, if necessary. While all the boys you used to hang out with at the bar, or all the people you used to work with may be important at some point in the story, throwing 10 new names at us every two pages will quickly overwhelm your reader. It's a common writer's technique to blend them into a single character to avoid burdening the reader with too many different names. Pick one main character per important setting.  What will the setting of your autobiography be? Where do the most important dramatic shifts, or events, or changes take place? In what way has that placed shaped you and your story? Think both in terms of the geography and in terms of the specifics–your country and your state might be just as important as your street, or your neighborhood.   Quick exercise: Write down everything you associate with your hometown, or the region you're from. Do you identify as a Midwesterner, if you're from Iowa, or do you identify as an Iowan? When people ask you about where you're from, are you embarrassed to describe it? Proud? If you've moved around a lot, consider focusing on the most distinctive, memorable, or critical-to-the-story locations. Mikal Gilmore's Shot in the Heart, which chronicles a life on the move and his tumultuous relationship with his brother, the convicted murderer Gary Gilmore, involves dozens of moves and living spaces, but will often summarize them, rather than dramatizing them.  The difference between a successful and unsuccessful autobiography is whether or not you'll be able to limit the scope into a single, unifying idea, or whether the amount of different details will overwhelm the story. No one can include their entire life in a story. Some things will have to be left out. Deciding what those things will be can be just as important as deciding what will go in.   An autobiography is a record of the entire life of the writer, while a memoir is a document that covers a very specific story, period of time, or aspect of the writer's life. Memoirs are more versatile, especially if you're young. An autobiography written at the age of 18 might be somewhat tedious, but a memoir could be great.If you want to write an autobiography, you need to pick a unifying theme to carry through the story. Maybe your relationship with your father is the most important part of your story, or your military experience, or your struggle with addictions, or your rock-solid faith and the difficulty in holding onto it.  When you start getting some sense of what you think your autobiography or memoir might include and where you might go with it, it's helpful for many writers to write up a rough outline of where the story will go. Unlike in fiction, where you've got to invent the plot, you already will have some sense of where your story might end, or what will come next. Outlining can be a helpful way of looking at the major plot points all at once and deciding what to emphasize and what to summarize.Chronological autobiographies work from birth to adulthood, following closely to the order of events as they occurred in your life, while thematic and anecdotal autobiographies will jump around, telling stories based around particular themes. Some writers prefer to let whim drive the car, and not a complicated outlined plan for the plot. Johnny Cash's autobiography Cash wanders around his story, starting at his home in Jamaica, then going back in time, constantly shifting around like a good late-night conversation on the front porch with an old timer. It's a wonderful and familiar way of structuring an autobiography, impossible to outline.  The biggest secret that successful writers, novelists, and memoirists have about the process? There is no secret. You just sit down and start working. Every day, Try to write some more of your autobiography. Get some more out on the page. Treat it like you're mining raw material out of the earth. Get everything out, as much as possible. Worry about whether or not it's good later. Try to surprise yourself before your work is done.   Ron Carlson, a novelist and story writer, calls this commitment "staying in the room." While you might want to get up and grab a cup of coffee, or fiddle with your record player, or take the dog for a walk, the writer stays in the room and sticks with the difficult part of the story. That's where the writing happens. Stay in the room and write.  Many a writing project has faltered due to lack of production. It's hard to sit down at the desk every day and actually get some words on the page, but it can be a lot easier for some people to write up a schedule and try to stick to it. Decide how much you'd like to produce on a daily basis and Try to meet that level every day. 200 words? 1200 words? 20 pages? It's up to you and your work habits.   You might also decide on a set amount of time you can commit to the project every day and not worry about a number of words or pages. If you've got a solid 45 minutes of quiet after you get home from work, or before you go to bed at night, set aside that time to work on your autobiography undisturbed. Stay focused and do as much as you can.  If you want to write an autobiography but aren't thrilled about the idea of actually writing, or if you struggle with things like vocabulary and grammar, it might be more appropriate to record yourself "talking" your story, and transcribe it later. Get yourself a good drink, a quiet room, and a digital recorder and hit the green button. Let the stories flow.   It might be helpful to have someone to talk to, treating the recording process more like an interview. It can be weird to just talk into a microphone by yourself, but if you're a great raconteur with lots of hilarious stories to tell, it might put you in your own element to have a close friend or relative to talk with and lob questions at you. Most rockstar autobiographies, or memoirs written by people who aren't professional writers, are "written" this way. They'll record interviews, telling stories and anecdotes from their lives, and then put it together with a ghostwriter who oversees the actual writing of the book. It may seem like cheating, but it works.  Memories are unreliable. Most real-life stories don't fit together with the simplicity and the elegance of fiction, but writers have a tendency to let narrative guidelines and rules affect memories, polishing them and fitting them into the story. Don't worry so much about whether or not the story you're telling is 100% accurate, worry about whether or not it rings true in the emotional sense of the story.   Sometimes, you might remember two important conversations with your friend Craig, both times over pizza at your favorite place. Maybe they happened on two separate nights two years apart, but for the purposes of the story it'd be a lot easier to make it all one conversation. Is there any harm in doing so, if it tidies up the narrative? Probably not. There's a difference between cleaning up the messy details in your memory and straight-up making stuff up. Don't invent people, places, or problems. No outright lies.  Every writer has an internal critic perched on their shoulder. That critic complains, finds everything too cliché, shouting insults into the writers ear. Tell that critic to can it. When you're first getting started, it's important to uncensor yourself as much as possible. Just write. Don't worry about whether or not what you're writing is perfect, whether each sentence is immaculate, whether or not people are going to be interested. Just write. Do the important work of cleaning it up in revision.   At the end of each writing period, look back at what you've written and then make changes, or better yet let your writing sit on the shelf for a while before you do anything to make changes.  If you're going along and writing your story, you might eventually get stuck and find yourself at a loss for where to go next. Time to get creative. Use all your research and the documents you've collected to wrestle something out of yourself onto the page. Treat it like a collage, or an art project, more than a "book."   Dig out a picture of your family from the era yore writing about and write about what you imagine each character was thinking at the moment the picture was taken? Write it. Let someone else talk for a while. If you've done some interviews with family members, write in one of their voices for a while. Transcribe an interview you conducted and get their input on the page. Imagine the life of an important object. Make your grandfather's brass knuckles he brought back from WWII be the point-of-view character for an argument between he and your father. Sit with your father's coin collection and imagine his collecting them, his feeling them, his looking through them. What did he see?  , When you're writing narrative prose, it's important to learn to distinguish between writing scenes and writing summaries. Good writing is paced according to its ability to summarize periods of time in narration and at a distance, and to slow down certain important moments and display them in scenes. Think of summary like montage in a movie, and scenes like particular exchanges of dialog.   Example of summary: "We moved around a lot that summer. It was all scraped knees and gas station hot dogs, the hot leather in the back of dad's '88 Suburban. We fished at Raccoon Lake, got leeches at Diamond Lake, and visited grandma in Kankakee. She gave us kids a jar of pickles to split while dad got drunk in the backyard, fell asleep, and ended up with the god of all sunburns lobstering across his back." Example of scene: "We heard the dog whine and Grandma opened the screen door a crack to look out at him, but we could see she held her foot against the bottom of it, like she was scared of something she saw. Her hands were still covered in globs of pie dough and her face was like a mask. She said, 'Bill Jr. you touch that dog again and I'm calling the police.' We stopped eating pickles. The pickles seemed ridiculous, suddenly. We waited to hear what she would say next."  , Good writing is made of luminous particulars and specific details. Bad writing is made of abstractions. The more specific and detail-oriented you can make your writing, the better off your autobiography will be. Try to make each important scene as long as possible, get everything out of it that you possibly can. If it ends up being too much, you can always cut it back later.   If the emotional core of your story revolves around your relationship with your father, you could give us 50 pages of a systematic takedown of his worldview, railing against his small-mindedness, or misogyny, or tyrannical ranting, but you might lose a lot of us three pages in. Instead, focus on things that we can see. Describe his after-work routine. Describe the way he said things to your mother. Describe the way he ate his steak. Give us particular details.  Most inexperienced writers over-use dialog, writing whole pages of exchanges between characters. Writing dialog is very difficult, especially in an autobiographical project. Only use dialog when characters absolutely need to speak, and summarize all other spoken language. Aim for no more than one exchange of dialog for every 200 words of summary and narration.   When you're writing a scene, the dialog should be used to move the scene forward, and should also be used to show us something about how the character is experiencing the scene. Maybe it's important for the grandmother character that she be the one to stand up to Jay Jr. and tell him to stop. Maybe that's a big important change in the drama.  There are no "good guys" and "bad guys" in real life, and they shouldn't show up in good writing. Memory has a tendency to colonize our opinions, and it can be easy to erase the good qualities of an ex-girlfriend, or only remember the good parts of college friends. Try to paint an even-handed portrait though, and your writing will be better off for it.   There should be no straight-up evil characters that show up in autobiography, they need to have motivations and attributes all their own. If Bill Jr. is a drunken dog-beater, there needs to be a good reason why, not just because he's Satan reincarnate. Let "good" characters have moments of embarrassment, or failures of character. Show them in failure so we can see them in success and appreciate them more for it.  Keep to your production schedule as much as possible. There'll probably be days that you won't feel like writing much, but try to keep going. Find the next scene, the next chapter, the next story. Jump around if you need to, or go back to the research well to jog something else loose.   If you have to put your writing aside for a while, so be it. You can always live a little more, gain some more perspective, and return to the book with fresh eyes. An autobiography can be an ever-changing thing. Keep living your life and writing new chapters.	Start documenting. Interview your family and friends. Travel and talk to long-lost relatives. Go to the family archives. Consider planning an exciting project to write into your autobiography. Read other autobiographies. Find the emotional truth of your story. Name the way in which you've been changed. Write a list of the important characters in your story. Decide where most of the story will take place. Limit the scope of the book. Start with a rough outline. Just start writing. Write up a production schedule. Consider recording your story and transcribing it later. Let yourself remember incorrectly. Tell off the "cool police.", Incorporate as many other elements into your autobiography as possible. Understand the difference between scene and summary. Write small and write specifically. Use dialog sparingly. Be generous. Stick with it.
Cast on 16 stitches., Work 4 rows in moss stitch. Continue in stocking stitch until the pocket measures 12 centimeter (4.7 in), ending with a knit row. Cast off in knit stitch. Cut the yarn, leaving sufficient to sew up.	Pocket. Border.
Make a figure of 8 with your first rubber band and poke your index finger through one hole and your middle finger through the other.  This time, don't twist them to make a figure 8. Instead, simply slide them over your fingers in an 0 shape.  Take one side of the bottom band and bring it up and over your finger, and then drop it so that it rests on top of the other two rubber bands, in between your fingers. Do the same with the other side.  Place it on top of the last one, spread between your fingers. Make sure you do this after each step, so that there are always three rubber bands on your fingers.  Pull one end up over your finger and drop it over the rubber bands in the middle, and repeat with the other side. Then add another rubber band to your fingers.  You will quickly see a fishtail pattern forming between your fingers; this will be your bracelet. Keep weaving the rubber bands until the bracelet is big enough to fit around your wrist.  Take the two bottom bands and pull them over so that you only have one around your fingers. Then slip the loose ends onto a C or S clip, and do the same with the loose end on the bottom of the bracelet.	Use two fingers as a loom, and set up your first band. Place another two rubber bands on top. Bring the bottom rubber band over the top of the other two. Add another rubber band. Again, bring the bottom band over the others. Keep repeating this pattern. Finish your bracelet. Experiment with different color and weaving patterns to create lots of different rubber band bracelets.
, Lifting the vehicle allows more freedom for the tires to move under the wheel wells.  Higher quality suspension systems like Jeep's Rubicon or Rubicon Express allow the axles and tires to articulate and move in relation to objects, thereby supplying much improved traction.        The most common lift ranges are 1-4 inches (3-10 cm). If you do not lift the vehicle, there is reduced body-to-tire clearance and increased risk of damage to the undercarriage, frame and suspension. On the other hand, too much lift will cause the vehicle to be top heavy and is, generally, not very practical.  Skid plates, "Nerf" bars and roll cages can help protect you and your vehicle while out on the trail.    Large tires add extra ground clearance and allow for a smoother ride and better handling. Surfaces of the trails greatly and these may require differing tread designs. The universal or "knobby" tires are a minimum requirement and provide a good starting tire for most off roading trails. Tires ranging from 29 to 35 inches (75-90 cm) in height will be sufficient for most off-roading adventures. These tires are also designed to run at a very low pressure (5-15psi or 35-100kPa). Low tire pressures are preferred for flexing around tight spots and corners in the trail. The low pressures generally give more traction and the tires are less likely to be punctured by sharp rocks and other debris.  Many trails can be found in books, online and through your local group or club. Trails range greatly in difficulty: The novice should start with easy or medium trails.   Easy trails are usually just basic off-asphalt trails and require no technical or extraordinary handling experience. Any four wheel drive (FWD) or all wheel drive (AWD) vehicle should be able to easily navigate these trails. Medium difficulty trails will likely be relatively mild with no extreme grades and only a few more technical obstacles. A small SUV is recommended,— one, preferably, with after market tires and/or suspension. Hard trails should be left to the well seasoned and experienced off roader. Once your vehicle is prepared with after market tires and suspension, the vehicle should be outfitted with a roll cage. Roll cages should be considered a necessity and should be installed before you attempt this class of difficulty.  Rocks can move, boulders can be slippery and water driving can be tricky. Each can be more intense than anticipated.  Observe the terrain, obstacles and upcoming features closely and react with a level head. Going slowly allows you more time to react to your changing environment. Remember, off-roading isn't a race. It requires technical driving, some finesse and large measures of patience and restraint to maintain a constant, slow speed and "crawl" the terrain successfully., Try tackling some hills and a couple of rock beds. They offer a slippery surface and a stiffer challenge when attempting to crawl your vehicle. Once you build confidence and ability, your off-road driving experience can go one of two ways.— It will only get easier or it will become more challenging ans intense. The choice is yours. You should look expand your horizons and attempt new challenges.  When driving on more challenging rock beds, always have a spotter outside your vehicle to help you with wheel placement. A spotter is a person that looks for what you are unable to see from inside the vehicle and will help guide wheel placement.       When driving on sand, snow or ice, loss of control is also a possibility. Drive much more slowly than normal and use snow chains or studded tires to greatly improve performance and ease of handling. On these surfaces, you will need to keep tires from spinning by providing the best traction possible and changing your speed gradually. That is, accelerate from a dead stop to speed and decelerate from speed to a stop should be slow, even and gradual.       On sand, knobby tires can greatly increase traction. As the tires spin, they act as paddles to propel you forward or backward. Still, no matter the tire type, you cannot spin too much. There is a very real danger of sinking your tires in the sand and it can happen before you know it. Increase your awareness and, if this starts to happen, stop before you are more than a few inches deep (especially if you aren't actually moving any at all). Try backing up, or rocking the vehicle out of the depression before it becomes a crater.  The best way to learn how to traverse all kinds of obstacles and surfaces is to try it— learn by doing. Up the difficulty of your playground and don't be discouraged if things become tougher than you expected. Respond to the challenges as best you can, then listen to the experienced off-roaders. They may offer suggestions about how to better spend your time on the trail or to more easily surmount recent challenges you have faced.   If you are unable to complete a section of the trail, other drivers on the trail will probably be willing to help you navigate the obstacles by spotting or will give you advice. Forcing your way through an obstacle or trail, may damage your vehicle. Remember: Your vehicle should survive the ordeal with little or no damage and live to off road another day. Your vehicle will be needed to carry you and yours safely home from the trail and is likely used around town too, so avoid powering through difficult situations.	Purchase a reliable off road vehicle, such as a Jeep Wrangler. , Adapt the vehicle by lifting the vehicle, that is, adjusting the suspension. Install accessory items to improve safety and vehicle toughness. Purchase large tires. Take your vehicle to a legal off-roading trail. Start out slowly until you get the hang of the terrain. Remain calm in all situations. Build your skill and confidence. Experience as many terrains and trails as possible.
Cover surfaces like trim, windows, and floors with drop cloth. The drop cloth is suitable for painting since it absorbs paint easily and allows for smooth painting.At this point it is safest to clear the floor of any potential tripping hazard that could catch on the sprayer hose.  Wooden sticks are commonly provided with purchased paint and work well with mixing. To strain, a simple and effective method is using scrap window screen.This will remove any foreign particles or lumps and guarantee a smooth coat.   Use a Two-Part Epoxy Primer as they are waterproof, resist corrosion, and offer the best level of adhesion for metal and industrial painting., Hanging your pieces gives you closer to a 360º access while painting. This will also work well for bottled spray paint. If however you do not have access to a stand, simply spray the pieces over an ample piece of drop cloth.  Allow them to dry, and add a second coat.If using bottled spray paint, apply the primer as evenly as possible all around the metal part.  Store your primer in a cool, dry, and well-ventilated area. Also check to ensure the seal on your container is air-tight. Primer will not expire if properly stored, but it will evaporate if not securely sealed. Also keep in mind that primer is flammable and should be kept away from open flames, points of ignition, and temperatures over 100ºF.  Make sure to remove your compressed air source and air regulator before you begin cleaning. It is important that a spray gun is thoroughly cleansed before you switch to a new substance, so follow the related wikiHow's instructions closely before moving on.  More often than not, paint stores will be glad to provide a wooden paddle for stirring. Be sure to ask for one with your purchase. As with the primer, using scratch window screen is an effective and simple way to filter out any lumps or foreign particles from your paint., There are a few keys to keep in mind while painting. Maintain a distance of about 6 inches between the tip of the spray gun and the material surface. Using a sweeping motion that goes side to side while painting. If the spray gun is not in motion, then do not pull the trigger. This can lead to uneven, blotchy painting.Allow the paint to dry completely; this often takes 20 minutes to an hour for each coat.  The clear-coat finish will also protect the chrome against rust and dust. Follow the same tips you did in the previous step.  You can then buff the chrome exterior using a buffing cloth and buffing compound to give it a glossy shine.	Guard your workspace from unintended painting. Mix your primer and strain it to prevent any clogs in the spray gun's tip and internal filters. Hang or position any pieces to be painted on a metal stand. Evenly coat the pieces with Two-Part Epoxy Primer using your spray gun. Properly store any left over primer by pouring it from the spray gun's paint cup into its original container. Clean the spray gun properly before adding your chosen paint. Mix and strain any paint to be used with the spray gun. Apply your chosen automotive paint. Give the chrome a polished appearance by applying 3 coats of automotive clear-coat paint. Wait for approximately 3 days until the automotive clear-coat paint has dried.

A lot can go a long way, so you only need about 1 to 2 tsp (5 to10 ml) of ketchup, at most.   Use a soft cotton or terrycloth rag for best results. Tomato juice is a mild acid, so the use of tomato-based products can help dissolve debris causing tarnish and dullness on your brass. Ketchup is your best option since it is so thick, but in the absence of ketchup, you could also try tomato paste or tomato juice.  Wipe the sides of the brass object down with the ketchup-covered cloth, coating all sides in the ketchup.   For best results, rub the ketchup on in a single direction instead of rubbing it on in a back-and-forth motion or a circular motion.  Use a damp cloth to wipe off the ketchup after allowing the tomato substance to sit on the surface for a couple of minutes.   You could also rinse the brass under running water to get the ketchup off, but using a damp cloth provides the added benefit of a little extra buffing.  Use a dry, soft cloth to dry off any remaining moisture while giving the brass a final shine. Thoroughly buff the entire surface by passing over it in small, circular motions.	Squirt a dollop of ketchup onto a soft cloth. Rub the surface of the brass with the ketchup. Wipe off the residue. Buff until dry and shiny.
Guitar straps come in a wide variety of styles and sizes - some are audacious, some are plain, some are thick and padded, others are thin "seat belt"-style straps. Check out the selection at your local music store or in classified ads to get a sense of the options available to you. Below are just a few things you'll want to consider when picking out a strap:   Material - Many of the most affordable straps are made from the aforementioned seat belt-style material, but for a little more cash, it's possible to buy durable all-leather straps. Size - Not usually a major concern because the vast majority of guitar straps are adjustable, but you'll still want to be sure the strap is at least long enough to allow comfortable playing while standing up. Padding - Some guitar straps incorporate padding into the part of the strap that is slung over your shoulder to make playing more comfortable. This is usually made from foam, but sometimes fur or other materials are used. Aesthetics - Guitar straps come in a huge variety of colors and designs. Pick one that's right for your "sound".; , Guitar straps typically have leather (or fake leather) ends in the shape of rounded triangles. On each end should be a small hole with a slit cut in the side of it. These holes will support the weight of your guitar while you play.  Almost all electric guitars have two small knobs that fit into the holes on the strap. The first of these is at the base of the guitar's body - in other words, if you stand the guitar up vertically, it will be at the "bottom" of the guitar. This knob typically sticks out about 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) depending on what type of guitar you have. Slip the hole that is farther from the strap's belt-like tightening/loosening buckle over this knob.          To ensure comfort during playing, ensure that you slip the strap hole over the knob so that the fitting buckle faces outwards - otherwise, it may dig into your shoulder.  Look at the spot where the neck of the guitar meets the body. Nearly all electric guitars will have a knob near here. Slip the second strap-hole - the one that's closer to the buckle used to adjust the strap - over this knob. Put the other end of the strap on this knob.  Congratulations - your guitar is now "strapped up". Now, it's time to test out the strap. If you are right-handed, sling the strap over your left shoulder so that the guitar hangs in front of you, allowing you to strum with your right hand and fret with your left. If you are left-handed, do the reverse - sling the strap over your right shoulder.  Now, ensure your strap fits comfortably and doesn't inhibit your movement by playing a few simple chords or songs. Try playing in a variety of ways - standing up, sitting down, and even kneeling or laying down, for instance.  When you play with a strap, you want your playing to come as easily and as naturally as it would without one. This means that your strap should allow the guitar to hang at such a height that you can strum and fret as you normally would. Use the strap's adjustable buckle to change the length of the strap as needed for your comfort and ease of playing.	Find a strap that's right for you. Find the holes on either end of the strap. Connect the strap to the knob at the base of your guitar's body. Slip the other hole on the strap over the second knob. Slip the strap over your shoulder. Test your strap out by playing. Adjust the strap's length as needed.
larger than your leaf. Place sheeting on the ground. Make sure area is clear of debris and additional leaves. Also, this project works best in an area that is free of any moisture.; , Make sure the leaf is centered and the veins are face up.  Working quickly, use gloved hands to integrate concrete mixture together. Spread mixture over the leaf until you achieve a thickness of approximately 2.5 to 4 centimeter (1.0 to 1.6 in).   Smooth hand over concrete to remove air bubbles and create a flat surface.  Cut wire to within 5 centimeter (2.0 in). of the edge, overlapping pieces if necessary.   Add more concrete over the chicken wire, spread again to a 2.5 to 4 centimeter (1.0 to 1.6 in). thickness. Smooth your hand over the top to remove bubbles.  The plastic will remain in place as the design cures and dries, which could take up to 48 hours.   Add a second piece of plastic over the top of the design to ensure it cures properly and does not simply dry out.  If you worked in a humid environment, the leaf may have already decomposed and broken down.   Use a hose with jet spray nozzle to remove remaining leaf pieces.  You can place the stones in the desired area, but avoid walking on them until the curing process has finished.	Cut plastic sheeting that is approximately 15 centimeter (5.9 in). Place leaf on top of plastic sheeting. Mix concrete according to package directions and then apply directly to leaf. Cut chicken wire to leaf size and place over to the top of the concrete covered leaf. Wrap edges and leaf in the remaining portion of the plastic, taking care to adhere plastic to design with fingers. Peel away small pieces of leaf once design has cured. Spray stones over the next several days as the curing process takes nearly a week to complete.
This is a simple snake that you can make out of a paper plate. It lays flat on your table, but springs up into a long snake when you hang it! Here's a list of what you will need:   Paper plate Acrylic or tempera paint Paintbrushes, spongers, etc Pencil or pen Scissors Crayons, markers, or googly eyes Red paper or ribbon White school glue or tacky glue String, thumbtack, hole punch (optional) Rhinestones, glitter, etc (optional); , Be sure not to go too far into the middle or else it may not be big enough.   If you don't have a paper plate, use a small plate to trace a circle onto a large sheet of paper. Cut the circle out using a pair of scissors, and use that circle instead.  You can paint the snake however you want. You can use a paintbrush, a sponge, or even your fingers. Snakes come in many different colors and patterns. Here are some ideas to get you started:   Paint the plate a solid color and let the paint dry. Next, dip a sponge into a different color and tap the excess paint off onto a paper towel. Then, dab the sponge all over the plate. If you want to add another color, wait for the first one to dry. This will give you a scale-like effect.Wrap a sheet of bubble wrap (bubble-side-out) around a rolling pin and secure it with tape. Pour two colors of paint onto a palette and gently roll the pin across. Next, roll the pin across the plate. You will get a scale effect.You can also color the other side of the plate to make the snake's belly. Most snakes have a plain, light colored belly. Do this once the top of the snake dries., Make the spiral about half an inch thick. It doesn't have to be perfect, but try to make it even all the way around. The center of the spiral will be the snake's head, so make it rounded.   You are drawing the spiral on the back so that you won't see it on the top.  Start front the outside of the spiral, and work your way in. Try to do this right on the line, because you don't want the line to show on the finished product.  At this point, you can paint on some extra designs to make your snake even more special. Here are some ideas to get you started:   Paint thick stripes across the spiral to make a striped snake. Paint Xs or diamond shapes across the spiral to make a diamond pattern. Glue some colorful rhinestones using white school glue or tacky glue.Try not to add too many, or your snake will be too heavy. Make some squiggles and patterns on the snake using white glue. Then, shake some glitter onto the glue. Tap off the excess glitter and let the glue dry.  You can draw the eyes on using a marker or crayons. You can also paint the eyes on. If you have googly eyes at home, you can glue them on using white school glue or tacky glue.   Remember, the head is the rounded part in the middle of the spiral.  Cut a thin 1 to 2 inch (2.54 to 5.08) long rectangle out of red paper. You can also use a piece of thin, red ribbon. Cut a V shape into one end of the rectangle. This will be the snake's forked tongue. Lift the head up and glue the tongue under it.  You can punch the hole at the end of the tail, right between the eyes, or even in the tongue. Thread a piece of string through the hole and tie it in a knot. Use the other end of the string to hang the snake from a door knob, a stick, or even a thumbtack in the wall.	Gather your supplies. Cut off the raised edge of a paper plate. Paint or decorate the paper plate. Draw a spiral on the back of the plate. Cut out the spiral shape. Add more decorations to the snake. Add the eyes onto the front of the head. Add the tongue. Punch a hole through the snake if you want to hang it.
If you’ve got foggy windows in the summer, turn down your air conditioner. This will warm up your car and get the inside air temperature to match the outside a bit better. You can also open your windows a bit to allow more outside air in (and it prevents your car from becoming too stifling)., If the fog is on the outside of your windshield (as it will be during the summer), you can remove it with your windshield wipers. Simply turn them on to their lowest setting and let them run until the fog is gone., This is a quick way to get the temperature inside your car to match the temperature outside. Roll down your windows as far as you can so that the warm air outside gets into the cool interior of your car.	Turn down the AC if it’s warm outside. Turn on your windshield wipers. Open your windows.
The tub has to be able to fit the cymbal in it. If the water in your tub is too hot or too cold, it will ruin the cymbal and possibly crack it. Make sure that the water in your tub is nice and warm. A good mix is 1/3 of cold water and 2/3 of hot water. To test the water, stick your hand in the tub. Your hand shouldn't get cold but it shouldn't burn either. It should feel like a relaxing bath.; , Take your cymbal off it's stand and gently lay it down into the tub. It should be face up like you'd have it mounted on your stand. The cymbal doesn't have to be soaking in the tub for hours, just leave it in there for 1-3 minutes. This will help loosen visible dirt and will help with the rest of the polishing process. Leaving the cymbal in the tub for too long can damage it so be sure to not leave it in there for longer than three minutes.  To dry the cymbal, take it out of the tub and lay it on a dry towel. With another separate, small cloth, pat the cymbal dry. Don't hit the cymbal really hard, a small and light pat will do. For one or two minutes, focus on getting the cymbal dry by patting it. Never scrub the cymbal as this can completely ruin the sound and looks of it.  Put some cymbal polish (whatever one you've chosen) on a small, dry, clean cloth. Clean a small area of the drum cymbal and wait for the polish to soak in. If you try to clean the whole cymbal in one go, the polish will dry and become very hard to remove. If you're not sure about what way to clean the cymbal (I.e, Clockwise or Anti-clockwise) just keep in mind that you need to follow the grooves engraved in the cymbal. Keep repeating this step until you've cleaned the whole cymbal.  Dip another small, clean cloth into the lukewarm water tub and gently wipe the polish off. You still want to follow the grooves in the cymbal and you should avoid scrubbing the cymbal too hard. Every time you rinse off a small part of the cymbal, dry it using the same technique described in step 3. Keep repeating this step until the whole cymbal is rinsed and dried and you're pretty much done. Enjoy your shiny, new cymbals!	Fill the tub with lukewarm water. Soak the cymbal. Dry the cymbal. Apply the polish. Rinse off the polish.
Racing your car on public roads is dangerous and illegal. You will also have a lot more fun on a track that is made for speed and safety. Search on the Internet (see "External Links" below) or look in a phone book.       ; , Call the racetrack on the phone and ask when they will be hosting a "Driver's Education" event or when it will be open for the public. You should not race your car until participating in a Driver's Education event. If the track knows of none, search on the Internet for "motorsports clubs" in your area. If you have a car with a racing heritage like Audi, Porsche, BMW, Subaru, etc., search for that club (i.e., Porsche Club of America). When you go to any track, if there is classroom time, avail yourself of the wisdom which will be imparted. Many racers began their careers participating in autocross events. Contact the local NASA (National Auto Sport Association) or do an online search.  On the day of your first Driver's Education event, check all of the mechanics of your car including oil (which should be topped off), tire pressure (a few PSI higher than normal-ask the instructor or another participant), tire tread, steering fluid, brake fluid and brakes. If you are not experienced in doing a safety check on your car, take it to a mechanic and tell the mechanic you plan on racing the car. When you get to the track, check the tire pressure and oil again. Look under "Things You'll Need" (below) for a list of items to bring to the track.  Every event has different rules. One common rule is a prohibition on passing, among the most dangerous of racing moments. Find out the rules from the event organizer.  Feel the track. Be the track. On the track, go around twice at a normal rate of speed to get the lay of the land; if possible, get out and walk the track paying special attention to the turns. Commit the track to memory by drawing it on paper, noting turn-in and track-out points. Do a drive-through with an instructor if at all possible. Don't be scared of the track (AKA: An "O'Gorman"), but give it the proper caution and respect.  When you first go on track at speed, follow an experienced driver. Every turn is approached with a minds-eye view of entry & exit and understanding of apexes. The prime apex point is the point in the center of the turn which will produce the fastest exit speed. Depending on track conditions(debris)and traffic you may need to use an early or late apex. You want to maintain as shallow an arc from your entry (turn-in point) to the exit (track-out)point. You should always maximize the amount of road surface used.  Rather than braking incrementally when going into a curve, it is best to be going as fast as you are prepared to and to then brake fast. This does not mean slamming on your brakes to the point where you could go into a spin (a common mistake) but it does mean knowing when to brake at the last possible moment. Braking can be practiced daily on interstate off-ramps, etc. Braking is usually done to impending lock-up. With ABS, you simply stand on the brakes. Braking can slow the car to the speed necessary to successfully negotiate a turn as well as settle the car at turn-in or when used in combination with steering and acceleration can cause the car to begin to rotate in order to carry more speed into a corner. A teacher familiar with the track can tell you exactly when you should start braking and turning and even where your car should be positioned going into turns.  Or you can start drifting if you know how to and take a steady and compressive turn and go out of it without losing much speed.  If you are driving under "No Pass" rules, this usually means that passing is still allowed if consent is given. Ask first. If this is the case, ask for the signal to show your consent. You should not be doing a lot of passing (or any passing) as a novice but you should be getting passed often. When you see a driver approaching rapidly, the driver may well be looking for your signal. It is important to be courteous by giving this signal whenever it is safe to do so. This signal is usually an arm point out straight to the left if you wish the driver to pass to your left or, if to the right, your arm out the window and bent over the roof pointing to your right. Give the signal clearly with your arm fully extended. Immediately upon giving the signal, make sure your car behaves as if it is ready to allow passage on the side you indicated. Do not point right and then track right. Stay in your line of travel. Only give a passing signal on straightaways.  While most tracks attach the same meaning to each flag, there is some local variation. Use this paragraph as a guide but be sure to check with the event organizer. The following will usually apply: A solid green flag means that the warm-up lap has ended and that passing may commence (when passing is allowed and then only according to rules of consent). A blue flag with a diagonal yellow stripe means that you need to allow the car behind you to pass. This is usually only shown when you have already failed to do the right thing without request. At the next passing zone, give the signal and hold your line. A stationary yellow means that there is some type of danger ahead. Slow down and use caution. A waving yellow means that there is a disabled car on the track. Slow down and prepare to go off your line to avoid the car. A flag with alternating yellow and red vertical stripes means that there is debris on the track (e.g., an oil slick). Slow down and watch for debris on the road. A black flag means that there is something wrong with your car. If the black flag is shown at all flag stations, it means that all cars are being called back to the pit, usually because there has been a crash or there is something else obstructing the track. Safely slow your vehicle, indicate to the flagger that you have seen the flag and pull into the pits for instruction from the track master. A red flag means you must stop your car immediately. Brake slowly and be aware that another car may be behind you. Come to a stop, preferably off to the side. Stay still and stay in your car. There may be emergency vehicles entering the track. Wait for instruction. A black flag with a yellow meatball means that the run group is about to end. Proceed through the checkered flag and slow to a cool-down lap.  The last run is called a "cool-down" lap because you are cooling down the brakes, which, by now, may be hot enough to melt rubber. Go slow and try not to use your brakes at all. Wave at all the corner workers. Use all of your fingers.  When you are driving, position your hands at 3:00 and 9:00 clock format. This will give you the best response time and best posture at high speeds.  Keep both front windows down. This is necessary so you can signal a pass and arguably safer in crashes where the glass breaking would otherwise cause injury. Also keep your radio off. You want to hear the noises your car is communicating to you, not your music.  You will be shocked at how difficult it is. Early in your development you will be assigned an instructor at each Driver's Education event. As you improve and the different organizations get to know you, you will be allowed to drive without on instructor.  You will be shocked at how fast you go through brake pads, rotors and tires. the additional strain on your car will have you replacing other unexpected items.  If you are especially clever, buy a dedicated track car that will easily join a popular and relatively inexpensive race class.  Each racing organization has a Competition School that is necessary to get your Novice License.	Find a racetrack. Get schooled. Perform a safety check. Learn the rules. See the track. Track to curb. Learn how to brake. Alternate of braking. How to be Passed. Learn and be mindful of the flags. Chill out. Steer correctly. Keep your windows down. Driving fast takes a lots of practice. It is an expensive pursuit. If you are smart and lucky you will recognize early that you've become addicted and will get your daily driver off of the track and buy a dedicated track car. After over 40 track days, you may begin think about racing.

There are four main kinds of backing up maneuvers you might come across in your large vehicle driving: straight back, offset back, alley dock, and parallel parking. Each of these can be identified by the following characteristics:    Straight back spots are usually located in a grid and form a perpendicular (L-shaped) angle with the traffic passage that vehicles pass through to go deeper into or exit from the parking area.  Offset back spaces are usually arranged in an offset grid. These meet the traffic passage vehicles use to enter into or exit the parking area at a diagonal angle.  Alley dock spaces are almost always for semi-trucks. These require you to move straight back through a narrow passage and then turn sharply to maneuver the trailer to meet a loading/unloading dock, which is usually at a right angle (L-shape) to the passage.  Parallel parking spaces are on the side of the road, with either traffic, obstacles, or empty spaces before or after the spot. These require you to back your vehicle in, and can be especially challenging. New drivers may want to avoid these if at all possible., This is going to be slightly different for semi-trucks/vehicles with a trailer versus large, normal trucks that have a bed attached to the cab. While large, attached-bed trucks will turn similarly to smaller vehicles you may be used to driving, these will require plenty of extra room to complete the turn. Semi-trucks/vehicles with trailers will turn backwards opposite the direction you turn your wheel.Getting the hang of backing up a semi-truck/vehicle with a trailer requires time and practice. You should consider finding an empty parking area and executing reverse maneuvers to get a feel for how your trailer responds to turning. If you are are prepping for a driving test or expect to have to reverse your large vehicle into a space, you should purchase some traffic cones from your local hardware store or set out some obstacles, like a cheap folding chair, in an empty parking area. This way you can practice avoiding and guiding your trailer/rear end around obstacles.  You'll want to pull several feet ahead of your parking spot to make sure your turn doesn't cut too sharp and hit parked vehicles in the near-side spot, or swing wide and hit vehicles parked in the far-side spot. The more distance between your large vehicle and the parked cars means you will have more distance to straighten your rear-end before approaching the parked vehicles. This extra room can be the difference between scraping up another car and sliding into your spot without incident.   Roll down your mirrors on both the driver and passenger side of your vehicle. You want as clear and as unobstructed a view as possible of your mirrors. Do this especially it it's raining, as raindrops can negatively impact your perspective or obstruct your view. Ask any passengers to step out of the vehicle. Even well-behaved passengers can be difficult to see around while backing up. A clear line of sight will help you prevent potential damage to your vehicle or others.  Your mirrors should give you a general sense of the dimensions of the area you will be parking in. However, mirrors can sometimes distort distance or miss important features, like thin metal signs, posts, and so on. Take note of the surroundings in your mirrors and step outside of your vehicle. Then:   Compare your walk-around evaluation of the parking area to your mirror view. Note any inconsistencies, difficult to see obstacles, or missed obstacles. Evaluate the size of the parking spot. If you feel that the spot might not be a good fit, or if you are nervous in your ability to park, you are probably better off finding another parking spot. Adjust your mirrors upon returning to your vehicle. Now that you have a more complete idea of the area in which you are parking, you can adjust your mirrors to give you a better perspective of the surrounding area you will be turning into. Your mirrors will normally be situated for straight-traffic driving, so adjusting these for a better parking view can help immensely., For attached-bed trucks as well, but especially for semi-trucks/vehicles with a trailer, you should swing your front-end in an outward arc away from your parking spot by cutting your wheel in the direction of the parking spot. This will allow the rear-end of your vehicle to cut sharply in the direction of the space you are attempting to park in. Once your rear-end is angled diagonally into the spot, straighten it by turning your wheel ¼ turn or less in the direction away from the spot.   The more space between you and the already parked vehicles/obstacles surrounding the spot in which you are attempting to park, the more time you'll have to align your rear end with the parking spot. This will give you more space to make small adjustments and guide your rear-end into the spot. Outside of your initial hard cut in the direction of the parking spot, which began the hard turn of your rear-end toward the spot, you should only make slight adjustments while backing up. Large adjustments will likely result in over- or under-steering. If you feel your angle of approach too far off, you should pull out and start again. You should keep a close eye on the front- and rear-end of your vehicle during these maneuvers. While swinging out wide with your cab to angle your rear-end into the spot, it's easy to swing out into cars parked in spots across from the one you are backing into., Once your rear end is aligned with the spot, your cab will likely still be at an angle to it. Allow your rear end to travel a few more feet into the spot, then turn your wheel in the direction you made your first hard cut - in the direction of the spot. This should begin straightening your cab without changing the angle of your rear-end. Use gentle steering corrections at this point; oversteering could result in the angle of your trailer/rear-end changing significantly.   Some spots are too narrow or are at too sharp of an angle for you to back into in one attempt. Even experienced large vehicle drivers sometimes need several tries before their vehicle is in the right position when backing into a spot. Adjust your vehicle as necessary. You may need to pull out of your spot, straighten your vehicle one more time, and reverse back into it, nice and even. When pulling out, be careful your rear-end does not cut short or wide into surrounding vehicles.	Identify your backing up maneuver. Understand the mechanics of backing up. Pull ahead of your spot. Check your mirrors and do a walk-around. Swing out wide with your cab. Straighten out your cab.
Look for strings you feel good playing on; it's important to be comfortable when you play.  This is optional. The goal is to get a better feel on your strings. In this way, your fingers will slide with greater ease. Beware though––this is only to help you, but don't overdo it, don’t apply too much “fast fret”!       , If you work without it, you will practice the technique but you will not keep the rhythm. If you do practice with one, be aware that you will not be able to use it in a band or a composition., If you only play with two fingers, start playing with your third finger on a song that you already know. Don’t play a high speed rhythm at the beginning. (Don’t start with Slayer’s Raining Blood, for example.)      , Just scrape the string with the tip of your fingers to be fast enough. If you lose power in the sound, you can use a boost or distortion pedal to offset it. It is also a good way to highlight your shred when you play it in a band!, Focus on your right hand (for right-handed players). The D or G strings are the best for training., Try to change the note when you play. After that, work on your right hand by changing the string you are playing.	Play on high quality, round-wound nickel strings. Apply “fast fret” to your strings. Work with a metronome so that you don't lose the rhythm. Learn to play with three fingers on a high speed rhythm (180 bpm). Play the strings perpendicular to the body when you're feeling comfortable with the technique. Train yourself by staying on only one note. Work on your left hand once you're able to shred on one note.
The soap can break up fat inside the clog, much the same way it dissolves grease in the kitchen sink.   If you cannot find dish washing soap, you can try shampoo or bits of bar soap. It will not be as effective as dish washing soap, but it may work.; ,,, This method is best if the bowl is not too full to begin with, since the soap will be more effective.	Squeeze several squirts of liquid dish washing soap into the toilet bowl. Pour 4 more cups (0.9l) of hot water into the toilet bowl to activate the soap.  , Wait 20 minutes.  , Turn the water valve on and flush the toilet.
Focus on a theme of your own. You might want to make it really original, like the Great Sith War or the New Republic. You can also visit many different places for different planets, or just make one in the setting.   A Jedi could be walking around the neighborhood then attacked by two Sith. Or, you could make the story more complicated by putting it before or after the movies, or even in between.; , Humor will improve the amateur movie, allowing for much forgiveness for the amateur setting and storyline! Add few jokes and punch lines to your movie. It wouldn't be a good one without it. Make sure that you understand people's styles, and make the humor fit to each of them.   Make your own funny scenes. For example:  Rebel 1 and rebel 2 are walking. Rebel 1 collapses. Rebel 2 calls his commanding officer. Rebel 2: "Sir, my partner collapsed and is not breathing, what should I do?" Commander: "Make sure he is dead, then tell me." Rebel 2 shoots rebel 1. Rebel 2: " Now what?".   Make a parody of the original movies. Parody is both fun and clever. Creating a parody script will teach you a lot about analyzing and writing.  You'll need this for the actors to follow and to know that your film has a fully fledged storyline.  You'll need at least one set to film against.   If you live near a city or in one you could make it in Coruscant (see episode 1,2,3). If you live in woods, it would be a good idea to make the movie in Kashyyk (see Episode 3) or Endor (see Episode 6). If you live in a place like Arizona (desert), you could make it on Tatooine (see Episodes 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6). If in the mountains, make it on Hoth (see Episode 5). Or, if you live in the mountains with either forest or snow (never use both, unless you are creating your own planet), you can make forest moons like Endor or Yavin 4, or ice planets like Hoth. If you have a big field, you could make it Naboo (see Episode 1 or 2). If you live near a swamp, make it Dagobah (episode 5).  Do not just film the thing with toy lightsabers and guns and make swoosh sounds with your mouth. Download Lsmaker or FXhome visionlab Studio (both have a lightsaber effects program). Add other sound effects from the internet.  You can play it on your guitar but you can make it better by adding the real deal. You can get music from the internet as well.  This will depend on your budget and computer type; do the research to get the best for what you can afford.  Remember how Harrison Ford (aka, Han Solo) flew the Millenium Falcon in circles just to lose the Imperials in that asteroid field in "The Empire Strikes Back?" Well, to get characters with a good personality like Solo, you need actors with an equally good personality.   Don't try to use characters from the movies too much, they won't anything like the real thing at all (unless you have a really good makeup artist), and people will get confused. Try to make your own characters, or try to make the character you know and love from a different time (for example, you could make someone Luke Skywalker when he was growing up on Tatooine). Droids are recommended, but optional. If you decide to use droids, you can get some costumes, and if the color of it doesn't fit you, you can either bleach it or tie-dye it.  Get people who are happy with the camera, directing actors, making costumes, doing makeup, writing scripts, editing on the computer, etc. Wherever you have strengths, take on the role, otherwise find others to help you.  Include a lot of popcorn. And let it roll.	Come up with a plot. Make it funny. Produce a script. Make a set. Use good effects. Find suitable music. Use a good editing program to bring everything together. Get some actors. Assemble helpers for filming. Gather your family and friends together for a movie night.
Silk flowers cannot be dyed using fabric dye, because the fabric cannot be boiled. Although you can attempt using food coloring, it will likely rinse off the fabric because it is not permanent. The most success has come from dying silk flowers with acrylic paint. Therefore, you will need a tube of acrylic paint in a color of your choice, a container of gel medium, and water.  Depending on the type of silk flower you use, you may need to prepare them a bit. If your flower has a stamen in the center, you’ll need to use painters tape to block it off in order to prevent it from being dyed. Anything else you don’t want colored should be blocked off with painters tape as well.  To make the dye for your silk flowers, mix 2 parts acrylic paint with 1 part gel medium, Use a stir stick or spoon to fully incorporate this, and then add a small amount of water to thin it down. The amount of water you add to the mixture is dependent on how bright you want the dye to be; the more water you add, the paler the final color. When you’re done, put the dye in a wide-brimmed bowl or container, and place newspapers around it to prevent leaks.  Place a single flower in the dye, and hold it so that it is completely covered in the color. Carefully lift it out of the dye using the stem or tweezers (if there is no stem), and place it onto the newspapers. Use a paper towel to pat the flower and remove the excess dye. Then, leave the flower to dry on the newspaper for 2-3 hours.  Work through all your flowers, dying them using the aforementioned methods. After they have dried for about 3 hours, remove any painters tape you might have applied.	Gather your supplies. Prepare your flowers. Make your acrylic dye. Dye your flowers. Repeat the process.
If you are unsure if you're eligible, go ahead and apply anyway -- you can ask specific questions later if the show contacts you about being a contestant.   If you have appeared on any version of Wheel of Fortune in the past, you are not eligible to reappear. Also, if you have appeared on a game/dating/relationship or reality show in the last year or three of these shows in the last decade, you also are ineligible. In addition, you will be turned down if you work for or are related to anyone who works for Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc., the game show prize suppliers, or any TV station that broadcasts the show.; , Visit the Wheel of Fortune site. In the blue navigation bar located under the header photo, hover over "CONTESTANTS." A pink drop-down menu will appear with several options. Click on "Be A Contestant."   The first question will appear, asking you about your age group. Click on either "Adult," "College Student," or "Teen." Fill out the registration form completely and accurately.  As an alternative to the form, Wheel of Fortune has started a "Face of the Fan" contest where prospective applicants send in a 60-second video to score an audition. This way, any person in any city can have a chance.   Visit their website for more information. Because a million people audition each year and only 600 or so are chosen, it is strongly encouraged that if you don't have video equipment to stick to sending in the application form.  It's 39 feet (11.9 m) long, 13 feet (4.0 m) high and bright yellow. It rolls through cities, down highways and into America's heartland. Thousands of fans fill out applications and gather in front of the stage with a traveling version of the famous Wheel and Puzzle board. Applications are drawn at random throughout the event, calling individuals on stage in groups of five to participate in a brief interview, play a version of the Wheel of Fortune speed-up round and win special show-themed prizes.The most promising candidates are invited back to participate in final auditions for the show, usually held at a later date in the Wheelmobile host city. If you want to be notified when the Wheelmobile comes to your area, you can fill out a form online to be notified. However, they do say that they may not be able to contact everyone., They're looking for players who clearly can have fun, are calm in front of the camera, and are good winners and losers. They want you to be decisive and logical in calling out letters and in strategy.   Energetic contestants with a sense of humor generally do the best. Of course, keeping a positive attitude is helpful, too. It's about having a good time, whether you win or lose., The auditions are often held in hotel ballrooms. The contestant coordinators bring about 70 wannabe contestants together and create a sort of mini version of "Wheel of Fortune," complete with puzzles and a miniature wheel. All the participants take turns standing, calling out letters, and solving puzzles.   Then they take a 5 minute written test, consisting of 16 puzzles (where you have to fill in the missing letters). Afterward, they grade the tests and hand outdoor prizes. Then the coordinators tell some of the people to go home, while other people are allowed to stay and play more mock "Wheel" games (as the coordinators size them up). It all takes about two hours. Unfortunately, even if you do make it past the first round, you still won't know the verdict when you finally do head home. You'll have to wait indefinitely to be contacted -- if you've been selected, that is. Whether you're chosen or not depends both on your test scores and on their impression of what kind of contestant you'd make.	Read the eligibility rules. Apply online. Submit a video. Find the Wheelmobile. Have the persona. Rock the audition.
Going out of business sales are often good opportunities to find inexpensive furniture.   Check online or call furniture stores in nearby communities to ask about scheduled sales.; , Damaged furniture will likely be discounted.  You can buy many types of furniture, including solid wood dining sets, bedroom furniture, coffee tables and end tables, desks, bookcases and television and stereo cabinets.  Some stores and websites specialize in selling unfinished furniture.  You may say you saw similar furniture priced lower at another store, and you would be willing to pay the other store's price.  Shopping online has disadvantages because you can't test and handle the furniture, but prices may be much lower. Be sure to include shipping costs when deciding whether to buy online. Get the best prices by comparing online websites(Wayfair, FabFurnish, Ikea, urbanladder, etc)	Watch Sunday newspaper ads, television ads and online websites for sales at local furniture stores. Shop at retail furniture stores for new items that are scratched or dented. Purchase from all-wood furniture specialty stores to avoid furniture made from cheap pressed wood or particle board, which may be sold at high prices even at premier department stores. Buy unfinished furniture from stores or online and stain or paint it yourself to save money. Negotiate prices with sales staff, as some retail stores will lower prices for customers who negotiate. Shop online for discounted furniture.
The ability to hear, recognize, and then match a pitch with your voice is a fundamental ear training skill. While some people have a natural ear, others are “tone deaf.” If you are “tone deaf,” you develop this skill through consistent practice.   Find a digital tuner, piano, or acoustic guitar. Digital tuners are ideal for this exercise because the tool tells you if you are too sharp or too flat. If you don’t have access to any of these tools or instruments, there are several vocal match websites and apps available for you to choose from.; , A target note is the musical note that you wish to match in pitch. You can choose any note within your vocal range—you could start by trying to match pitch with the lowest "C" in your vocal range. As you move through the exercise, continue to pick random notes that fall within your vocal range and attempt to match their pitch.   Play the target note on the digital tuner, piano, or guitar. Listen to the pitch carefully. Try to hear the note in your head. This ability to hear, or visualize, a note in your head is called auralizing. This skill is developed over time and through persistent practice. Sing the target note. If you are using a digital tuner, look at the screen to see if you have perfectly matched the pitch, if you are flat, or if you are sharp. If you are off key, slide your pitch up or down until you perfectly match the pitch. Once you have matched pitch, select a new target note and repeat the process. It may take you awhile to find notes that are within your vocal range and you are comfortable singing. Don’t be afraid to experiment with notes in different octaves., Scales are musical exercises that go up and down in a predetermined pattern. Major scales are the most predictable and familiar. Scales are extremely adaptable and personalized exercises. When you sing scales, you can focus on mastering a specific technique, such as vibrato, overcoming a certain problem, like pitchiness, or increasing your vocal range.   Play a major scale on a piano or acoustic guitar. The C Major scale is an excellent place to start. The C Major scale follows this pattern: C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C, C, B, A, G, F, E, D, C. Listen to each pitch and visualize the note in your head. Play the exercise and sing along. As you move up and down the scale, focus on matching and maintaining each pitch. After mastering one major scale, move on to another major scale. Repeat the process., Arpeggios, like scales, are musical exercises. Instead of moving up and down from pitch to pitch, arpeggios go up and down in intervals. Practicing arpeggios will not only improve your pitch, but they will also enhance your ability to jump from one pitch to another pitch as you sing.   Play a major arpeggio on a piano or acoustic guitar. Basic arpeggios follow this pattern: 1, 3 (Major Third), 5 (Perfect Fifth), 8, 5 (Perfect Fifth) , 3 (Major Third), 1. Start with the C Major arpeggio. It follows this pattern: C (1), E (3, Major Third), G (5, Perfect Fifth), C (8), G (5, Perfect Fifth), E (3, Major Third), C (1). Listen to each pitch and interval. As you hear the notes, visualize the pitches and intervals in your head. Play the exercise and sing along. As you move up and down the arpeggio, strive to match and maintain each pitch. Pay particular attention to hitting each interval. After mastering the C Major Arpeggio, work on another Major Arpeggio. Repeat the process.	Match pitches on a digital tuner, piano, or guitar. Select a target note. Sing major scales. Sing major arpeggios.
Now you will want to create the tube. This tube comprises the main section of the headband. It will go around the head and embellishments will be added to it. Make it as even as possible but since it is made of stretch fabric, most imperfections will be hidden naturally.          Fold the rectangle of fabric. If you’ve chosen to use stretch lace, this will be unnecessary. If using other materials, fold it lengthwise so that the wrong side is facing outwards. Pin the material using straight pins, so that the long edges are in line with each other. Straight pins should be placed perpendicular to the long side of the fabric. This will keep your sewing machine from catching on a pin if you forget to remove one. It will also make it possible to sew right over the pins as well. Sew the length of the material, leaving your quarter to half-inch seam allowance and the ends open. Use a stitch and sewing machine needle appropriate to the material you have chosen. Stretchy fabrics will require a ball-point needle and a stretch or zigzag stitch. For plain cotton a normal needle and straight stitch should suffice. The same methods can be done by hand but will be more time consuming. Reverse the fabric. This can be done simply by hand but it may be easier to use basic tools. The most common method is to use a small safety-pin. Pin it at the end of the tub in such a way that the dead of the pin is inside the tube. Begin pulling small sections of fabric over the pin and pushing the head down the length of the tube. This takes time but is fair simple. When you are done you may wish to iron the tube flat, to create more of a band appearance. You may also wish to forgo ironing, in favor of a looser, draped look.  The elastic will allow the headband to gently stay on your baby’s head, without constricting or requiring snaps or ties. It will also allow the band to grow with your baby, allowing her to wear it for longer. Be sure that you have enough elastic, as a too-tight band is not good for your baby.          Feed the elastic through the tube. This will be easiest if you place a safety-pin at one end of the elastic and use that to guide you. Make sure that as you pull the elastic through the tube, the elastic remains flat. Sew the two ends of the elastic together by hand or by machine. A zigzag or x-shaped stitch is good for this. Be sure that the elastic is flat and did not twist inside the tube. Close the tube. While it is possible to use your machine, this step works best when using hand stitching. Tuck the ends of the fabric inward as much as possible. Use careful, small whip stitches to join the ends of the tube together. If you do not want to sew by hand, close the tube with your machine, overlapping the fabric and sewing a line down the back. This method will be more visible that hand-stitching. With the tube closed, now your band is done!	Create the tube. Add the elastic.
Chain drives are some of the most popular and durable openers on the market. These drives use a metal chain on a sprocket to lift and lower doors.Chain openers also tend to be some of the most affordable options; however, the affordability and strength of a chain drive come at the expense of noise.Chain drives are ideal for the heaviest garage door types, including oversized doors, one-piece wood doors, and wind-rated or heavily insulated doors. If you have a detached garage or a garage that is at the opposite end of the house from the bedrooms, then the noise will be less of an issue.Many upgraded chain-drive models can come with chain separators to help stop the chain from hitting against the track, which cuts down on the noise of a chain drive.; , Screw drives use a long metal rod threaded like a screw to lift and close garage doors.Due to having relatively few moving parts, a screw drive tends to be quite reliable as well.If noise is your biggest consideration, screw-drive openers tend to be middle of the pack. They’re not nearly as quiet as belt or direct drives, but they are most typically quieter than chain drives.Screw drives also require a bit more maintenance than most of the other types. Despite having fewer moving parts, the threaded metal rod meshes against a drive section with plastic teeth to catch the threading. Without the proper lubrication on this drive, the rod can wear on the teeth and eventually strip them, so you must grease the works fairly regularly—approximately every few months.The type of garage door you have should also be taken into consideration. For heavy wood one-piece doors, the extra weight and strain can wear the teeth in the inner works of the drive down pretty quickly. This makes screw drives most effective with single-car garage doors or steel doors since the thinner materials cut down on weight.Screw-drive openers also offer some of the faster speeds available. Newer models can open at 10” to 12” per second as opposed to the more standard 6” to 8” per second of most other drive types., Belt-drive openers use a rubber or rubber-like belt on a cog to open and close doors.Since the opener doesn’t have the loud, banging metal parts, it’s one of the quietest options available.Consider your particular garage door. If your door makes a lot of noise on its track, then the lower volume of the belt opener may be moot.Pay special attention to the current of belt-drive openers. Alternating current belt openers start and stop at full power, which can cause the door to jerk into movement and lead to noise despite the relative quiet of the drive.Direct current belt drives offer soft starts and stops that reduce noise even further, as well as reducing wear and tear., Though less common than the other models, these alternatives are gaining in popularity, and both offer additional options for quiet door openers.   Jackshaft openers attach directly to the front wall of the garage, meaning no overhead parts.These models use cables attached directly to the garage door along with pulleys and a rolling torsion bar to lift and lower the door.Many models of this computerized system even include an automatic deadbolt that locks when the door closes for added safety.Due to the compact nature and computerization, jackshaft openers are some of the most expensive models available, and the cable system also means that they only work on sectioned garage doors.Direct-drive openers still have an overhead rail with a chain, but the actual motor moves along the track with the door connected to the motor via a J-arm.Since the motor moves instead of the chain, these models are also extremely quiet, and since the only real moving part is the motor, they tend to come with extremely good—maybe even lifetime—warranties. They are still on the pricey side, however—comparable to a belt drive opener., 1/2-HP is the standard for most garage doors, and it is also the most popular motor speed. Depending on the type of drive you pair it with, the 1/2-HP motor can lift most garage door types. However, while it can lift most door types, well-insulated garage doors and one-piece, wooden doors can put extra strain on 1/2-HP motors that might lead to more wear and tear than with something more powerful.  3/4-HP motors are the next step up from 1/2-HP models. The additional power makes these motors a more durable, longer-lasting option, but the increased durability comes with a higher price tag as well. The extra power doesn’t just increase the life of these motors, but it also means they’re capable of lifting heavier doors more easily without as much wear.   Door styles that might benefit from the additional power include one-piece wooden doors on two-car garages or specialty doors with heavy insulation and wind-load ratings.  1-HP motors offer the maximum in efficiency and power. These motors are perfect for the heaviest garage doors, including oversized doors and commercial or industrial doors. When it comes to a standard, sectioned garage door, the extra power may prove unnecessary for your needs, especially at the larger price.  In addition to the horsepower of a motor, you should also consider the current. Direct current motors are most common on belt drives, but more manufacturers are incorporating them into other drive types as well. Direct current motors are typically more expensive, but they offer the added benefit of soft starts and stops, which means that the drive begins a gradual lift and stop on the door, and this equates to much less noise than a motor that jerks to life and shakes the door.Direct current motors are also more likely to provide backup battery options, allowing you to get several uses out of your garage door even during a power outage.	Consider chain-drive openers as a cost-effective option. Consider screw-drive openers for a well-rounded option. Consider belt-drive openers for quiet operation. Consider direct-drive and jackshaft openers for quiet and highly dependable options. Consider 1/2-HP models for standard doors. Consider 3/4-HP models for insulated or one-piece, wooden doors. Consider 1-HP models for oversized or industrial doors. Consider AC versus DC motors.
Choose strong fabric, such as upholstery fabric, from the sample range. You can often get samples, off-cuts or even the whole sample book simply by asking nicely at a store you know stocks such fabrics. When the season or line is no longer fashionable, the sample books are often donated.; , Each strip needs to be at least 10cm/4 inches in length and 2.5cm/1 inch in width. For the best design, use a different fabric for each strip but coordinated. For example, keep flowers with flowers, stripes with stripes, etc.  Gather it by sewing through the middle several times and knotting off tightly. Repeat for each of the other strips. They will look like little bows.  To do this, align the middle pieces in a clock formation, fanning around. Then sew all of the center pieces together.   Use a strong needle that is suited for upholstery fabrics and a thimble or thumb protector to give you the necessary oomph to push the needle through. Sew slowly, as this can be hard going. For certainty of hold, do at least six stitches, up to ten at most.  This not only covers up the stitching but serves as the center of the floral brooch. Choose a pretty button!  , Sew the pink/brooch back in place. Check that it is firmly attached.   You could also glue it in place. If so, follow the package instructions.  The fabric flower brooch is now ready for wearing. Why not make a few more for friends and family?	Select the fabric. Cut the fabric into strips using pinking shears. Pinch the middle of one strip in. Connect all of the pieces together. Sew a button in the middle area. Turn the brooch over. Done.

Attach the yarn to the crochet hook using a slip knot, then work one chain stitch from the loop., Work 12 single crochets into the center of the chain you just created.  Join the last single crochet to the top of the first using a slip stitch. Completing this step should form a tight circle that will act as the foundation round.  Chain one. Double crochet once into the stitch at the base of chain and the stitch that follows, completing one decrease.  Chain three. Double crochet once into the next two stitches, completing another decrease. Chain three.  Repeat this pattern across the remaining stitches in the round.   Join the last chain to the top of the first completed double crochet using a slip stitch.  Chain three, then slip stitch once into the first stitch of this chain. Slip stitch once more into the first chain-three space.  Chain three, then slip stitch once into the first chain. Slip stitch once into the next double crochet. Chain three, slip stitch once into the first of those chains, then slip stitch once into the next chain-three space. Chain three and slip stitch once into the first of these chains.  Repeat this pattern around the rest of the round.   Join the last stitch of this round with the first using one slip stitch.  Work a chain long enough to wrap around your finger. Connect the last stitch of this chain to the opposite side of the picot decoration using a slip stitch.  The exact number of chains will vary depending on the size of your finger, so you'll need to check the length against your finger before completing the band. When joining the band to the decoration, slip stitch into the slip-stitch space in between picots on the opposite side of the ring.  Cut the yarn, leaving 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) of excess. Pull this excess yarn through the loop on your hook to fasten it off.  Using a tapestry needle, weave the excess ends into the stitches. This step completes the project; your ring should be ready to wear.	Chain one. Single crochet into the center. Decrease double crochet across the round. Slip stitch across the round. Chain around your finger. Fasten off the yarn.
Check to see if there is a webpage for foreign travelers about driving in the country you’re visiting. Many countries in Europe, for instance, will have information available online about specific driving rules and regulations. Since these webpages are designed for foreign visitors, they will often be available in multiple languages.   You own country’s embassy websites can also helpful. Visit the website for your country’s embassy that is located in the country you’re looking for information on. If information is not forthright, there will likely be contact information on the website.  Your own government’s recommendations about driving abroad can also be helpful. In particular, these websites will contain information about driving practices that you are used to, but that are uncommon in other parts of the world.   This will be especially helpful when visiting a neighboring country. When travel between the two countries is common, you will be able to find plenty of information on government webpages.  While you already know you should never drink and drive, it’s important to recognize that the legal blood alcohol content to operate a motor vehicle in many countries is very low. In some countries, such as Japan and Czech Republic, you can get into serious legal trouble for driving with any alcohol in your system at all.Your country’s embassy in your destination country is the best source of information on unique driving rules and regulations. Other countries, such as Italy and France, will fine you for not wearing a seat belt on the spot. Prevent this by always wearing your seat belt. Finally, some European cities have outlawed using your horn unless it is an emergency. While horn use is both popular and common in some countries, it is heavily frowned upon in others.	Visit the destination country’s government website. Check your own country’s recommendations. Be aware of strict laws in some places.
Check to see if the caulk has pulled away from the tub or wall, or if it has formed cracks that may allow water to seep through to the wall.; ,   Silicone caulk is soft and rubbery and often comes off in 1 strip. Latex caulk is harder and often more difficult to remove. You can locate a caulk-softening agent from a hardware store to help in the caulk-removal process. Use the agent and the least abrasive tool that you can use to remove the old caulk.    Latex is easiest to work with and clean up, but silicone is more durable. Caulk may come in a squeeze tube, but for others you may need a caulk gun.  Use a utility knife and a piece of wire or long nail to break the seal at the bottom of the nose piece.   Do not try to squeeze the caulk without piercing the seal because the tube may burst.  Make sure that the caulk is being pressed into the joint and not just sitting on the outside of it.  You may also purchase a caulking tool to shape and smooth the caulk. ,	Inspect the caulk around the wall joint of your tub or shower. Use a putty knife to remove the defective caulk from the tab or wall joint. Purchase either silicone or latex caulk to replace the caulking seals around the tub or shower. Cut off the tip of the caulk tube at a 45-degree angle. Place a bead of caulk along the joint. Use a wet finger to smooth the caulk. Remove excess caulk with a rag or a caulking tool.  , Allow the caulk to cure as directed by the manufacturer.
You can find this in the owner's manual, on a sticker inside the driver-side door jamb, or in the glove compartment.   It may be the same for all four tires, or the front and rear tires may be different—it differs by model. Normally, it will be in the range of 28 to 36 psi (pounds per square inch) or 195 to 250 kPa (kilopascals). You can also find the maximum tire pressure on the tires themselves, but use this only if you can't find the vehicle's recommended numbers. "Maximum" doesn't necessarily translate to "best." A good rule of thumb is to set the tires to 32 psi. Then find the proper pressure and correct as needed.; , Warm air expands, and will give you a false reading of greater pressure.  This is the little black or silver stem poking out from your wheel. Remove the cap, and put it where you won't lose it.          There are two kinds of valve stems: rubber valve stems and metal valve stems that are on wheels equipped with TPMS (tire pressure monitoring systems).  Place the plug end of the gauge squarely onto the valve stem, and press down firmly. It may hear the hissing of air escaping; if so, press harder until the hissing stops. Read the gauge as directed to determine the pressure.          If the tire pressure matches the recommended number, replace the cap and move to the next tire. Repeat this process for all four tires, plus the spare. Should you run flat, it's not going to be helpful to have a flat spare!	Find the recommended pressure. Check the tires when cool. Remove the screw-on cap from the valve. Attach the gauge.
The natural green copper patina can be mimicked with an ammonia solution, while the slightly darker color of an American penny can be created with baking soda and water. Because the application of these solutions are so similar, they are both described in this section.  Wipe the item clean with a dry cloth. Grimy copper items should be washed in warm, soapy water instead, then dried thoroughly.  If you are trying to create a green patina, you'll need to use ammonia. Work outside or in an area with a powerful ventilation system or fan. Ammonia fumes can be toxic, so ammonia should never be handled in an enclosed space. Rubber gloves and safety glasses are recommended.   If creating a brown patina with baking soda and water, no safety precautions are required.  Stir together 2 cups (or 500 mL) white vinegar, 0.5 cups (or 125 mL) non-iodized salt, and 1.5 cups (or 375 mL) clear ammonia.Ammonia can be found at some grocery stores and drug stores, but take care not to purchase the weaker "detergent" variety.   The more salt you add, the greener the patina will be.  This solution will turn your copper a darker brown, roughly the color of an American penny. Simply shake baking soda in a bottle of hot water one spoonful at a time, until additional baking soda does not dissolve., Use a spray bottle to apply the patina onto the surface of the copper. Spray more heavily if you want a more even result rather than streaks or patterns.  This patina may take a few hours to develop, but keeping it in moist air will speed this process up. If the copper is kept in a dry environment, use a plastic bag or plastic sheeting to cover the copper without touching its surface. This will help retain moisture.  Depending on the environment the copper is kept in, and how often it is handled, the patina may wear off or fade before it sets permanently. If this occurs, reapply as before, either to the entire surface or to the area wear the patina has rubbed off.   The green patina tends to be more powdery and easier to rub off than the brown one.	Mix your own solutions to achieve specific colors. Clean your copper. Follow safety procedures if working with ammonia. Use ammonia for a green patina solution. Mix a brown patina solution instead. Spray the copper with the solution. Keep in a humid area for one to eight hours. Reapply the solution if the patina fades.
An eBook reader is a device for browsing electronic files representing books. An eBook reader typically has a low-resolution but low-glare black-and-white screen, often not backlit, the size of a paperback book page. Compared to a general-purpose computer or smartphone which is often backlit, an eBook reader will be thin and light and have a long battery life. eBook readers typically read one or more of several proprietary "eBook" file formats. Some eBook readers are also capable of reading documents in other forms, such as open-standard "ePub" eBooks, plain text files, PDFs, Word documents, and so forth, and some will also allow you to take notes, sync with other devices, etc. eBook readers don't have the "feel" of books, which some enjoy. But they have a few advantages such as being lightweight and portable, and being able to hold a lot more than a single paperback ever could. This makes them ideal for taking away on vacation, for reading in a favorite outdoor nook, or for reading on-the-go.   A dedicated eBook reader may be the most convenient way to read eBook files, but it is not the only way. PC and smartphone software is available free of charge to read ePub and various proprietary eBook formats such as those for Nookand Kindle. It would be good for infrequent use, for back lighting, for a big screen which props itself up (on a computer, perfect for complicated material that requires glancing forward and back repeatedly), or for sampling the eBook concept before buying a reader device. An eBook reader can make a great gift for someone who is both a technology enthusiast and a reader of long books. Because there are many specialized kinds, make sure the recipient can easily return it if it turns out not to suit his or her needs. Not all eBook readers can handle the same formats. In addition to certain seller-specific proprietary formats, many readers support HTML, plain text, and JPG but not all support the open standard ePub.This is an important distinction if you want to check out ebooks from your library, or to read the vast library of copyright-free (in the United States at least) ebooks at Project Gutenberg with nicer formatting than plain text files can provide.Be aware that some eBook readers handle PDFs better than others; this is important if you intend to use PDFs a lot.Some of the most common dedicated eBook readers include Barnes and Noble Nook, Kobo eReader, Amazon Kindle, Sony eReader, etc., with each electronic reader having its own features, feel, and capacity. Non-dedicated eBook readers (that is, items that are used for other purposes as well) include your computer, smartphone (with relevant apps installed), and the iPad.; , There are numerous things that you need to consider when choosing an eBook reader. One important thing to keep in mind is that choosing an eBook reader is fairly much like choosing many other electronic gadgets and even cars in on key respect – it all depends on what you want to do with it, and there is no one right eBook reader for every person, and different features can make all the difference to your choice.Since the features count for everything, the following features are currently the ones to pay attention to:    Memory: How many eBooks or other documents does the eBook reader have the capacity for? Can this memory capacity be increased?  Format type: Can the eBook reader handle a variety of file types or only one type (see previous step)? Is this ability (or lack of it) reflected in the price?  Connectivity: Does the eBook reader have 3G and WiFi connectivity? Most of the recent ones should by now.  Screen friendliness: Here you need to be concerned about viewability, color, size, and reflectiveness (glare).   Viewability: Is it easy to read? Which eBook readers seem most like the pages of a book? Some have more of this feel than others.  Color: Black and white or color? Both have advantages and drawbacks. Black and white is easy on the eye for novels and sun reading (see "Viewability" below), while books and other items such as magazines or comics which need color to transfer their beauty and photos (such as art books, cookbooks, graphic novels, etc.), won't appear so well on plain black and white eBook readers and should be experienced in color.  Size: Compare the eBook reader screen with the screen of non-dedicated eBook readers such as an iPad or your laptop to see which you prefer, and if you're happy to downsize your screen reading experience.  Reflectiveness: One of the advantages of black and white eBook readers (using E-ink technology) is that they can be read in full sun without reflecting, glaring, or loss of image, unlike a laptop, color eBook, or an iPad. If you're planning on reading outdoors a lot, keep this consideration at the forefront.    Weight and comfort: Each person's impression of weight and feel is rightly different but there are some things to assess:  Does it weigh less than your usual paperback? It should. Is it easy to carry and hold? You don't want something that's bulky, awkward, or hard to hold. In particular, be sure to hold the eBook reader in the store to check its weight and to ascertain whether the weight is comfortable for you personally. You might spend hundreds of hours with your electronic book reader, and it is important that relationship on a physical level is comfortable. For example, one eBook reader might have buttons and screen that are easy to use for paging through content, but after five minutes you notice some eye strain. That product wouldn’t work for you because you are going to need to be able to look at it for long periods without eye strain or headaches.    Battery life: What's the battery life promised by the blurb? You don't want an eBook reader that runs out after an hour of sitting on your hammock at the beach. You could have taken a paper novel along in that case! Can the battery be replaced by you or do you need to send the eReader to a technician for replacement?  Ease of downloading: Is it easy to download eBooks? Do you have to connect to the computer or can it be done without a computer as the intermediary? This can be important when choosing an eBook reader as a gift for an older person who isn't that keen on "fiddling" with technology.Share ability: The ability to transfer eBooks to another eBook reader is important, especially if you need to remove purchased books from an old eBook reader to a new one; if you can't do this, you may lose the purchase when the eBook reader dies. Does the eBook reader allow sharing with friends or not?  Other features: What other features does the eBook reader have? For example, does it allow you to add notes? How easy is the process? Some readers have keyboards that work well. Others are difficult to use and can distract you from your reading. How easy is it to "page back" and find something? Are there dictionaries and is it possible to upload new ones?  , Although this is a time-consuming activity, it's the most important part of choosing an expensive product, especially one liable to fast changes and updates. You want to be sure that you're getting the best value product for its kind at the time, as well as knowing that it will do absolutely everything you want it to do. The best research will be a combination of reading both professional reviews and user-submitted content because this provides a balance of viewpoints. Where technology reviewers might be paid to focus on about certain features, the consumer points of view should help to inject some realism into the worth or otherwise of the eBook reader.   Ask others about their eBook experiences. Friends and family members may have insights about what is important to know before buying one. For example, some readers only allow you to read down loadable books, but others provide Internet access so you can also read blogs and websites. Asking people who already have used eBook devices is faster than researching the information and most people are generally interested in ensuring you don't encounter the same pitfalls that they did!  , While it may be tempting to purchase an eBook reader from overseas, double and triple check the compatibility for your home area. The problem may be that you cannot download books for it because you live in a different region from where you purchased the eBook reader and that would leave you with a less-than-bargain priced eBook reader! Moreover, check the method by which your eBook reader allows downloads. Some provide WiFi download compatibility and USB download, others only have USB download. What will be most convenient for you?   Look into the breadth of options for getting eBooks that comes with your eBook reader. Some eBook readers enable free reading with a bookstore and loan of items.If that appeals to you, realize that the extent of free reads and loans might be highly dependent on the particular bookstore. Check your local library's provision of eBooks. Many libraries are now adding eBooks to their lending systems. Talk to your local librarian about eBook reader compatibility issues, especially if you intend on relying a great deal on your library.  Some eBook readers are able to access more content than others, and the ideal is to get an eBook reader that has the largest content availability possible, to ensure that you can access eBooks that are relevant to your interests. However, the extent of access is changing rapidly and is becoming less of an issue. What is important is to check that the eBook reader that interests you can access the content that interests you. Ask the retailer for more information if your research hasn't made this clear.  Once you've done the research, make a list of the features you want (see the suggested things to consider above) and take this list along to the store. You may need to visit a variety of stores to cover each eBook reader you're keen to trial. Take a bit of time to play with the eBook readers and to ask the assistants questions about them. It's important to do this manual checking because it gives you the opportunity to hold the item, page through the content, see how the screen appears to you, and to simply get a feel for each type of reader in your own hands.   Try to read at least one chapter of a book to see how the reading feels on each reader. As you're doing so, think about the ease of seeing the text, the ease of turning pages, the ease of finding the information, etc.  It's a good idea to go home after your trialing expedition and to think through the purchase. You've done the research and the testing, now allow a few days for the right one to surface in your thinking. Don't be swayed by boredom, loneliness, stress, or the urgency of trends; these gadgets are new and therefore subject to a lot of change and if you're going to fork out a lot of money for one, it needs to be the right one for now.   While some eBook readers might have more bells and whistles than others, if you just want the basics at this stage, a cheaper, less fancy version could be a good initial solution, allowing you to upgrade to a fancier eBook reader as new versions are released down the track. Note that in the short time since eBooks have been released, the prices have been dropping dramatically, so waiting does no harm. Consider purchasing a reconditioned or used eBook reader. Older models are often just as functional as those which replaced them and can be found for much lower prices. Be sure to check the warranty information. New products can bring unknown problems with them and it's reassuring to know you can return it without hassle if something goes wrong, as well as finding out what happens if you lose any eBooks due to technical malfunctions.	Know what eBook readers are. Know what to look for in an eBook reader. Read online product reviews. Be careful about the ability to find eBooks and download them to your eBook reader. Check the eBook provider's breadth of published content access. Visit the store to try the eBook reader. Don’t rush your decision.
If there's potential to rock out, think like a Boy Scout. You may not be able to rock out as hard in flannel and suspenders ("braces" for you British folks with your eyebrows all a-flutter). Think ahead. How much rocking are you capable of?   Jeans and a t-shirt is always classic for either sex. Is this a party where you can gallivant discalced? Or will you be keeping your shoes on? Consider this when choosing your footwear. Ladies, get ready to move. The last thing you want is to interrupt your metal horns to adjust your hemline. Wear something comfortable.  If they're not already being cranked. But let's face it, you shouldn't be the one to have to get the party started. What kind of party are you even at? Your own? Ah, alright. Proceed.   Find music that gets everybody going. In this circumstance, rocking out is a community bonding session. You'll feed off their energy and they will feed off yours. As a result, a beautiful thing will become nascent. Take time to feel the vibes and let it brew. Don't crank the jams too loudly. The police hate that.  Sting loves it, however.  By this time, the party-goers should be in a distinctive yet morphing shape. Get in there! Show them your stuff.   Use your body. Don't be afraid to get on your knees or pop a handstand (you've been practicing after all, right?). Just make sure the area is clear before you risk popping someone's eye out. Then the fun and games just stop. Jump up and down. And then up and down again. And possibly a few times after that. If no one else is jumping, start it. They'll wonder why they aren't jumping with you. And hey, calf workout!  , Rocking out can be a great release and is sometimes necessary, but it also can be incredibly dangerous or, at worst, fatal. Drinking and driving, smoking, and other illicit drugs get all the hype--think of rocking out like the Korean War (when was that again?). Just because it doesn't receive the appropriate anti-marketing campaign doesn't mean you should rock out carelessly.   Watch your elbows. Those things can be weapons of destruction if flailed about angrily. Stay sober. Drunken rocking out is a recipe for disaster and a recipe for a trip to the temple of the porcelain gods. Besides, you'll want to remember this cathartic experience when it's over. Don't judge other rockers. They may not have the skills you do and that's fine. They may be rocking out to One Direction...also...fine...mostly. Either way, these people are made up of the same stuff you are: stuff that's looking to rock out. Embrace them.	Prepare the look. Crank the jams. Get moving. Be responsible.
They can happen very quickly and suddenly, so be very attentive. If the bright light hurts your eyes, look through a translucent curtain to dull the impact of the light, or focus your eyes away from the window so the lightning flashes in your peripheral vision.   Note that faraway lightning will be much more difficult to spot, so keep a steady watch. If you sense the storm is not close to you (e.g. faint thunder) watch more carefully for lightning bolts.; , Start a stopwatch, count in your head, or use the stopwatch on your phone. Do not stop.  Listen carefully- distant thunder may be difficult to hear. If you have been counting for a very long time, chances are you missed the thunder. Search for another bolt of lightning and start the process over.  (For example: 10 divided by 5.) If the dividend cannot be wholly divided by five, you can either round the quotient or divide to a decimal (you may need a calculator).   Before proceeding, make sure you didn't accidentally make a minor mistake or miscalculation. If you want to find out the distance of lightning in kilometers, divide by three. (e.g. 9 divided by 3). You are likely to come across a decimal, so choose if you want an exact measurement or a rough estimate.  (For example, 10 divided by 5 equals 2, so lightning is two miles away, or 9 divided by 3 equals 3, so lightning is 3 kilometers away.) You can do this as many times as you like, but try to space your countings a minute or two apart, otherwise you will likely end up with roughly the same result.  With time, the miles away of the lightning should either get smaller or larger, depending on whether the storm is moving closer or farther away from you. If you get roughly the same number for a extensive period, check your work to make sure you didn't have any miscalculations.	Look outside for a flash of lightning. Once you see the lightning, begin counting right away. Stop counting once you hear a roll of thunder. Divide the number of seconds you counted between the lightning and thunder by five.  Once you have found your quotient, that is how many miles or kilometers away lightning is.
Not all stars are, but some are, and can be very useful.  Eclipsing binaries, like Algol in Perseus, are two stars orbiting each other.  Compare these to the characteristics of known variable types to determine the type of variable star. For example, Cepheid variables have periods of days to months and amplitudes of up to 2 magnitudes, whereas Delta Scuti  variables have periods of less than 8 hours, and amplitudes of less than 0.9 magnitudes.	Determine if the star is variable. Determine if it is an eclipsing binary. Determine the amplitude and period of the variation.
Block the rear wheels with something heavy (like bricks or lumber which is small enough to jam under the wheels) to prevent the car from rolling or sliding while it's jacked up. Apply the emergency or parking brake to hold the rear wheels fast. (The vehicle's "PARK" gear will only hold one of the drive wheels, if you have a front-wheel drive car then it will hold only one of your front wheels and if you have a rear-wheel drive car then it will hold only one of your back wheels).  If you skip this step, loosening the lugs may be very annoying, if not impossible. It is also somewhat dangerous to loosen lug nuts after a car has been jacked up.  Caution: a floor jack's wheels need to be able to roll and the jack needs to travel a little and so it must not embed (sink) into a soft floor or surface.   Never work without jackstands that are on solid flat surface like stepping-stones or wide scraps of strong wood to keep the jackstands from sinking, leaning or tilting and falling, etc. Position the jackstands under a solid part of the car — the frame or subframe. You can easily damage the underside of the car, or even break something.       Give the car a couple of good hard, small shoves from side to side; if it's going to shift, slide off the jackstands, sink into asphalt, dirt or gravel, or just twist around and fall, better to learn now while the wheels are on than when you're partially under it with the wheels off.  In case the car slips off the stands, those wheels may prevent you, your arms or head from being caught under a falling car (preventing the car from falling to the ground) if the jack stands fall over.	Park the car in a clean, solid, well-lit place. Loosen the lug nuts before jacking the car up (do not remove lug nuts yet). Jack the car up with a sturdy jack on a solid surface (such as a floor jack if you have concrete to work on) and lower it very slowly and carefully onto jackstands. Finish removing the wheels, and lay the wheels under the car, just to the rear of the jackstands.
Allow the part to dry. Drying can occur using a hair-dryer or in air. If air-dried, allow enough time for the cleaning agent to evaporate from the defects. This may take several hours depending on the ambient temperature and cleaning material used on the part.; , This can be accomplished by spraying, brushing, dipping, etc. Allow the penetrant material to sit for a minimum of 10 minutes. Do not let the penetrant sit on the surface for longer than 2 hours as drying may occur. The part and penetrant should beat a temperature between 50 and 100 degrees Fahrenheit.  Remove as much penetrant as possible using as many cloths as necessary. This is followed by wetting a lint free cloth with a solvent. The cloth must be damp or moist. A cloth dripping with solvent will wash the penetrant material out of the defect and make the test ineffective. Allow the solvent to dry before the next step.  The developer usually come in a spray can and is normally white. Apply a light coating holding the can about 6 to 12 inches (15.2 to 30.5 cm) from the surface. You should see visual evidence of the metal surface showing after applying the developer. Too thick of a coat will make the test ineffective.  Bright white light for visible dye penetrants and UV light for fluorescent type penetrants. Evaluating the results. This is the most difficult part of the testing process. Most people do not have a lot of experience with the different defect types, for example, porosity, shrink, cracks, etc.Porosity is typically round and easily defined, while shrink can look like a big blob of residual penetrant. Solvent wiping can help in determining the defect type and if the indication you are seeing is from a real defect or just an anomaly not associated with a defect. Solvent wiping is achieved by wiping the area of interest with a cloth dampened with solvent. Do not flood the area with solvent or allow solvent to run or pool on the surface as this may washout the defect and make it undetectable. As soon as the wiping occurs you can look at the indication to determine defect type	Clean the part thoroughly using a suitable cleaner, acetone, aqueous degreasing, etc. Apply the penetrant to the surface being inspected. Remove excess penetrant using a clean, dry, lint free cloth. Apply non-aqueous developer. The evaluation should occur using the proper lighting.
To do tricks, you need to develop the right foot placement to ensure that the scooter will land where you want it to land. Typically, if you are right footed, your left foot will be your riding foot, placed forward on the scooter, and will not leave the scooter unless you're jumping to do a trick. The right foot will be used to push off and move the scooter, and will stand near the brake toward the back of the scooter when you're cruising.   Practice riding your scooter around and do what feels comfortable. Even if you're right footed, the "fakie" placement, with your right foot as the riding foot, might feel more comfortable.; , Before you start kicking the scooter out from under your feet while in motion, practice the basic "kick" while you're standing still on the ground. With your riding foot on the scooter, use your other foot to push the side of the scooter abruptly and firmly so it spins around under you and comes back to its original position.   Practice jumping out of the way of the scooter as you kick it back behind and around your body with your pushing foot. When you can do this regularly, you're ready to start trying a tail whip in motion.  It'll happen quickly, but you can lift the handle bar slightly with your hands to make sure the scooter raises off the ground. Try to keep the scooter as parallel to the ground as possible while you do this.   Practice by picking up the scooter and getting a feel for its weight. As you practice, get a feel for how high you need to lift the scooter (if at all) and how much you'll need adjust the scooter so it stays level. Your hands should never leave the grips for this move.  Place your riding foot on the scooter and start pushing off until you maintain a good speed. Stay balanced without going too quickly. Put your riding foot forward and position your pedaling foot on the opposite side of the brake, slightly hanging over the edge.  This will cross your legs slightly, so the trick is to get them back uncrossed and land the trick at the same moment the scooter makes it's full rotation. When you first get started, practice your timing by landing on the ground and move on when you can do that regularly.  When the scooter comes around towards your riding foot, place your riding foot on it, and pull it the remainder of the 360 degree rotation to land straight, then position your pedaling foot in a comfortable position.   This will take lots of practice. Steady the scooter and stop its rotation with your riding foot before planting the scooter back onto the ground with your pushing foot.  To do a heel whip, or a "opposite" tail whip, you'll do essentially the same move, but kick the scooter in the opposite direction. Push out with your pushing foot, using your heel to push the scooter forward, instead of behind you. Stop the rotation of the scooter with your riding foot and land the trick with your pushing foot like normal.	Choose your riding foot and your pushing foot. Practice the tailwhip while standing. Use your hands to control the height and motion of the scooter during the whip. Practice while in motion. Jump into the air, and push the brake sideways with your pushing foot. Land the tail-whip. Practice doing a heel whip.
This means, stop using the transpose button gradually, until not using it becomes the new normal for you.; , It is helpful to write out these tools using solfa notation, as this will make it easy to transcribe to other keys.  Choose one key per week, then at the end of the week, rehearse everything you have practiced. Note the difference between practice time and rehearsal time. In practice time, you are learning new material, while in rehearsal time, you are revising the material you already learnt.  Also, when practicing, be sure to have your fingers as relaxed as possible, as this would help improve on speed and accuracy, though much focus should be placed on accuracy  , What doesn't kill you only makes you stronger.  For example, if you are learning Key C on a certain week, move over to Key F or Key G the next week. The reason for this is because keys a perfect fourth interval apart are very much similar, with a difference of only one extra black note. For example, if you're moving from Key C to Key F, there is only one added black note which is A#.  Include all the inversions of the key you're learning.  Practice their inversions of the key.  Examples are the 2-5-1, 7-3-6, 7-3-6-2-5-1, b5-7-3, and 5-1-4.  In about two months, with some level of discipline and consistency, you should be able to break out of the transpose comfort zone.	Break out of your comfort zone. Write out everything you know on your favourite key including chords, scales, chord structures, scale patterns, and licks. Devote at least two hours daily to practice. Practice until you have developed muscle memory (you can play it without much effort). Don't be afraid of mistakes. As you move from one key to another, do this in perfect fourths or fifths. Practice all the triads (major, minor, diminished and augmented). Practice the seventh chords (Maj.7, Min.7, Dim.7, Dom.7, etc). Afterwards, begin to learn standard progressions and their substitutions on each key, one at a time. Begin to incorporate all the licks you already know on your favourite key into all other keys, one by one.
NAUPA is a non-profit organization with the goal of reuniting property with its rightful owners. The NAUPA website is the best place to start because it provides links to all of the state unclaimed property databases in the US. You can search the database for each state that you have lived in to see if you have any lost money., Using the NAUPA website, search for lost money in the state where you have or have had resident status. If you believe that you may have lost money as a result of the death of a loved one, then you will also want to check with the insurance department in the state where your loved one lived., NAUPA provides the links to other legitimate sources for finding lost money such as the IRS, National Credit Union Association, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and more. Make sure to search all of the sources that are applicable to you., Each state and federal website will have a different process for claiming your lost money. After you conduct your searches, you will need to carefully follow the instructions on the website.

Check NAUPA’s “Other Sources For Unclaimed Property” tab to see if there are any other sources of lost money that you can claim. Follow the steps to claim your money. Consider hiring a professional asset detective.
This example shows use of bronze and white papers for the card. You can vary the colours as per your requirement. Take a more than 160 grams per square meter weight paper (250 gsm paper is used in this example), preferably A4 sheet but you can really use any size you want. Fold it into half and decide which side you want to use as the front of the card.; , In this case, guidelines are made 2.5 centimeter (1.0 in) from the edge, leaving enough room for the design to be accommodated.  Don't use ordinary cello tape as it's hard to remove. Scotch tape comes off easily.    Here is how it will look.    This is how it'll look after finishing.    Make one or two rectangles with this ribbon depending on your preference. This is how it'll look after you're finished with pasting the ribbons.  You can use a negative embossing pattern also. In that case, you need to paste it on the back side, much like the angel embossing pattern.  This is how it'll look from the back as you emboss.   After you're through with embossing, cut out the portions from in between and if you wish to, make a thin border cut. ,   This is a flower punch. This is how it looks at the base. This shows you how it punches a flower out of a paper.  Using an ordinary paper punch, cut out two small circles of bronze paper and paste them at the centre of the white flower. And that's it. The card is ready!  ,	Choose the colours you want to use. Make guidelines on the back side of the front cover. Stick the embossing pattern with scotch tape along the guiding lines. Take an embossing needle (as you can see in the picture here) and start outlining the pattern on the front cover, much like moving a pen around on a stencil. Outline the inner pattern after you're through with the outer pattern. Keeping the edge of the embossed pattern in mind, cut the bronze (or whichever colour you want) paper ribbon and paste it as shown. Paste the second mold on the “outside” of the front cover (it's a positive embossing pattern). Start embossing with the needle on the reverse side. Paste a bronze colour paper at the back to give it a matched look.  , Use the same bronze colour paper, cut out flowers and paste them as shown. Paste a white flower of a smaller size on top of the bronze flower. Finished.
This part requires good balancing to ensure that they are not cut off too short or left too long.   Use a sharp knife, clippers, or hand shears to perform this.; , Finished basketry work should be carefully singed to remove the thin fibers that tend to stick out after working with the cane. Do this using the tip of a Bunsen burner or small craft flame.   Avoid using a wax taper such as a candle, as this will blacken the cane-work.  This will remove any dirt and improves the look of the basket. Do not use soap.  If it isn't, it will discolor and it may attract mold or mildew growth.	Cut off any excess ends of cane. Singe the work. Wash the piece with warm water. Ensure that the basketry work is fully dry before placing into storage.
If you want to be able to move your clay person around after it's finished, you'll need modeling clay. This clay doesn't dry in the air, so it's perfect for making clay models out of. If you want your clay person to be still once it's done, you can use oven-bake clay.   You can make your clay person all the same color, or you can use different colors for different parts of the body. For example, if you want it to look like your clay person is wearing a shirt, you can use a green or white piece of clay for the torso.; , Pinch off a piece of the clay. Roll the piece of clay into a ball. This will be the clay person's head.   It's up to you what color the clay person's skin will be. You can make the whole person out of blue clay, or you can find some flesh colored clay for the head and arms., Pinch off a piece of clay that's larger than the head. Shape this piece into a fat snake-like cylinder. Flatten the cylinder slightly.  Pinch off two more pieces of clay. Roll these pieces into two long tube shapes. One tube should be thicker than the other. These will become the arms and legs., Take the ball that will be the head and pinch out of it a little spike of clay. This will be how the head will attach to the body.   The neck should jut out of the head like a small spike or cone, and should be about half the length of the neck. And make sure it's thick enough that you can hold the head up by holding nothing but the neck between two fingers.  Take something narrow, like a pencil, or a toothpick, and burrow out a small hole in the top of the body cylinder. Make sure the hole isn't too wide, but wide enough for the neck to fit in. Make the hole deep enough for the neck to go completely in.  Stick the neck into the hole in the body so that the ball touches the body. Smooth out the edge where the head meets the body to make it secure., Find the middle of the smaller tube and tear it into, for the two arms.  With your thumb and finger, flatten a small bit of one end of both arms. These will become the hands.  First, cut out a bit of the flattened parts. Use something sharp to cut out a corner of the flattened ends of the arms. Then round out the corners of the hand so that it looks like a cartoony thumb and fingers.  Take the finished arms and attach them to the sides of the body. Smooth out the connection between the arms and body to secure them.   If the arms are too long, tear off an even amount from both arms until they're as short as you'd like., Find the middle of the larger tube and tear it into, for the two legs.  Bend one end of both of the legs. Shape this bent part into a rough foot shape. Make sure they are large enough to support the legs. Stand the legs up to test the feet. Press the feet into the table so that the feet bottoms are flat.  Stick the legs into the bottom of the body. Smooth the connection between the legs and body to secure them together. Make sure the feet are facing forward.If the clay person can't stay standing on its own at this point, you'll need to redo the legs and make them thicker.  If you're clay person can't stand up on its own after you attach the legs, there could be a balancing issue. You can always make the legs thicker, but sometimes the legs are plenty thick, and it still falls over. In that case, you might want to redo various parts of the person and experiment with a shorter torso, less clay for the torso, smaller arms, a smaller head, ect.   Also make sure the clay person's torso is straight, and that the arms are close to the same size and weight.  Tear off four small bits of clay. Make four balls out of these clay pieces. Two of these balls should be smaller than the others.  Push the smaller balls into the larger ones. Flatten them a bit into the bigger balls. These will be the eyes.  Press both eyes firmly into to the head of your person.If you want, you can use another method to make eyes, such as using two googly eyes, or making eyes out of paper.If you want a simpler method for making eyes, you can just take a pencil and make two round holes in the head for eyes. You can use a pencil to carve out a smile or open mouth as well.  Take a small pinch of clay and roll it into a small tube. The tube should be no longer than the width of the head. You can make it as thin as you'd like the mouth to be.  Place the small tube under the eyes, where the mouth should go. With the flexibility of the tube, you can make any sort of expression you want, a smile, a frown, or any other mouth shape.  You can add a nose to your clay person's face by just taking a small bit of clay and sticking it in the center of the face. Then use your fingers to form it into any sort of nose shape you want, a small ball, a little triangle, whatever shape you prefer.	Get clay. Make a ball for the head. Make a tube for the body. Make two long tubes for the arms and legs. Pinch out the neck. Make a hole for the neck. Attach the head to the body. Tear the arm tube into two pieces. Flatten the ends of the arms. Mold the hands. Attach the arms. Tear the leg tube into two pieces. Make the feet. Attach the legs. Troubleshoot any balancing issues. Make balls for the eyes. Finish the eyes. Attach the eyes. Make a small tube for the mouth. Attach the mouth to the head. Add a nose.
If you have decided that you are not okay with him paying, and you have talked about it, then the first step is to start changing the behavior. The next time you are out, offer to pay the bill. He may be paying all the time because you haven't offered to pay.Since you two have talked about it and how you feel about it, there shouldn't be any arguments. Try being lighthearted about it, keeping your tone bright and cheery.   ”Nope! My turn!” ”Hey, you've covered like the last 10 meals. I'm paying tonight.” If he takes out his wallet, ”Uh-uh, put it away mister. Tonight is on me.”  , It doesn't need to be a big deal; just let him know that you'd like to pay for yourself once in a while, starting with this bill.   An alternate way is to split the bill by items. Instead of splitting in half or for what you have ordered make an agreement to split up by parts. For example, if he pays for dinner then you pay for drinks and dessert. If you are going to the movies, he can pay for the tickets and you pay for drinks and popcorn.  You can also take turns with who pays for what dates. This works well with friends, too. If he pays for dinner one night, the next time you go out, you pay. Then the next date you have he pays, and so on, back and forth. This is a good way to evenly split the responsibility of paying without having to do check math every time the bill comes.  If you are uncomfortable with him paying for everything, but you can't come to an agreement about it, then just plan for dates that are very inexpensive or free.There are tons of fun, low key things you can do that are cost effective.This way, you still get to date and have fun, without the stress of figuring out who is going to pay or worrying about getting into an argument about it.   For example, you and your boyfriend could go hiking or biking at a local park, take a trip to the beach, go to a free outdoor concert in your community, or stay in for a movie night.	Offer to pay. Split the bill down the middle.Another way to change it up is to offer to split the bill in half or to “go dutch” (each person paying for what they ordered) with the bill. Pay for alternate dates. Go on inexpensive or free dates.
You can also use other fabrics as well, such as cotton, linen, or twill.For a larger bag, cut your fabric into two 16 by 18-inch (40.64 by 45.72-centimeter) rectangles.; , Take one of the fabric pieces, and turn it so that the wrong side is facing you. Fold both of the long edges and one of the narrow edges down by ¼ inch (0.64 centimeter). Secure the edges with sewing pins, then iron them flat.Do this step for both fabric rectangles.  Do not sew the two fabric rectangles together just yet. Simply sew along both of the side edges and the bottom edge on each piece. Remove the pins as you sew.  Take one of the fabric pieces, and turn it so that the wrong side is facing you. Fold the top, raw edge down by ½ inch (1.27 centimeters), and press it flat with an iron. Fold it down again, but this time by 2 inches (5.08 centimeters), and press it flat with an iron.Secure the folded edges with sewing pins, if you need to.  Sew it as close to the bottom, folded edge of the casing as you can. If you used sewing pins to hold the fabric down, be sure to remove them as you go. You can use a thread color that matches your fabric, or a contrasting color for something more interesting.  Use a color that either matches your bag, or contrasts with it. Avoid using cord that is too thin or too rough, or it will "bite" into your shoulder when you wear the bag.  The paper side is the smooth side. The rough side is the adhesive side.   Iron-on adhesive is also called "no-sew fusible web" and "heat-n-bond."  , Make sure that you are pinning the iron-on adhesive to the wrong side of the fabric. Also, make sure that the smooth, paper side of the iron-on adhesive is facing up.Consider using a contrasting or color for the fabric. For example, if your back is a solid black color, choose a colorful print for your appliqué.  Each iron-on adhesive will be a little different. If you are in doubt, start with a lower heat setting. Avoid using too much heat, or the glue will harden and become stiff., Cut right along the lines that you drew; there is no need to leave seam allowances.  Make sure that you are pinning the appliqué adhesive-side-down. Also, make sure that you are pinning it to the right side of your backpack piece.   You can also pin the appliqué to a pocket piece instead. You must do it before sewing the pocket onto the bag, however.  Again, avoid using too much heat, or the glue will harden and become brittle. Once the appliqué cools, pull the sewing pins out.  You can use a thread color that matches the appliqué, or you can use a contrasting one. If you are using a straight stitch, try to sew as close to the edge of the shape as you can. If you are using a zigzag stitch, sew right over the edge instead. This will help anchor your appliqué to the backpack as well as add some design., You can use the same color as your bag, or a contrasting color. Here are the recommended dimensions for the pockets:Inside: 6 by 7 inches (15.24 by 17.78 centimeters) Outside: 8 by 10 inches (20.32 by 25.4 centimeters)  , Turn the fabric so that the wrong side is facing you. Fold both of the short edges and one of the long edges down by ½ inch (1.27 centimeters). If you need to, use sewing pins to keep the fabric in place.   Leave one of the long edges alone. You will be folding it differently.  Fold it by ¼ inch (0.64 centimeters) first, then press it flat with an iron. Fold it again, by this time by ½ inch (1.27 centimeters). Press the edge flat with an iron once more. This will be the top edge of your pocket.  Try to get as close to the bottom fold as possible. You can use the same color thread as your fabric, or a contrasting one.  Pin the big pocket to the right side of your first backpack piece. Pin the small pocket to the wrong side of your other backpack piece. Try to pin the smaller pocket towards the top of the backpack piece.   If you wish to add an appliqué to the outside pocket, do that before you pin it.  When sewing your inside pocket, use a thread color that matches the backpack fabric. This way, the stitching won't be visible as much from the outside. You can use any thread color you want for the outside pocket: the same color as the pocket, or a contrasting on.   Do not sew along the top edge of the pocket. To prevent unraveling, sew back and forth a few times along the start and end of your sewing.  Make sure that everything is aligned.  Start just below the casing, and finish just below the casing. To prevent unraveling, sew back and forth a few times over the start and end of your sewing.   Do not start sewing from the top of the bag. If you do, you will sew the casing shut, and won't be able to use your bag.  Clip a safety pin to one of the 58-inch (147.32-centimeter) long cords. Starting from the front-left side of the bag, push it all the way through the front and back casing, until it comes out the back-left side of the bag. Repeat this step with the other cord, but start from the right side of the bag., Make a mark on the fabric where you need the grommets to go first, then make a small "X" shaped hole using a craft blade. Set the grommet using the manufacturer's instructions.   Do not make the hole too big. You want the fabric to stretch around the base of the grommet as you push it through. If you make the hole too big, the grommet will fall out.  Take both of the left-side cords, and pull them through the left grommet; you want the cords to be coming out of the front of the bag. Tie the ends of the cords into a tight, overhand knot. Repeat this step for the cords on the right side of the bag.   If the cords are too thin or the grommet is too big, the knot may not be able to hold the cords in place. Instead, pull just one of the cords through the grommet, then knot both ends of the cord together.	Cut two 12 by 14-inch (30.48 by 35.56-centimeter) rectangles out of durable fabric, such a canvas. Fold and press both of the long edges and one of the short edges by ¼ inch (0.64 centimeter). Sew the folded edges down. Fold the top, raw edge down twice on each piece to make the casing. Topstitch the casing down. Cut two 58-inch (147.32-centimeter) long cords. Trace your design onto the paper side of the iron-on adhesive. Pin the iron-on adhesive to the fabric you want to use for your appliqué. Iron the adhesive using the recommended heat setting on the package. Let the iron-on adhesive cool, then cut the appliqué out. Peel the backing off, then pin the appliqué to the front of the backpack piece. Iron the appliqué using the recommended heat setting on the package. Topstitch the shape down. Cut out your inside and/or outside pockets. Fold and iron both of the narrow edges and one of the long edges by ½ inch (1.27 centimeters). Fold the remaining long edge down twice. Topstitch the top, folded edge down. Pin the pockets in place. Topstitch the pockets in place along the bottom edge and both of the side edges. Pin the two backpack pieces together, with the right sides facing in. Sew around the bottom edge and both of the side edges using a ⅝-inch (1.59-centimeter) seam allowance. Pull the cording through the casing. Set a grommet into the bottom corners of your bag, ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) away from the edges. Pull the cords through the grommets, and knot the ends.
Keep in mind that there are many types of charm bracelets. Some are fancier than others, and some are larger than others. Gold is also more expensive than silver. So remember that price is a big factor too.; , Lobster clasp are the most common as it locks your bracelets at each end. Toggle is also very popular as it’s easily put on and taken off. Keep in mind that you might want a safety chain with your charm bracelet. A safety chain will insure that if your bracelet does come loose, you will still have the safety chain to keep the bracelet on your wrist.  You will want something that represents you as a person, maybe a hobby of yours, or important events in your life. For example, you might want to choose a wedding ring charm to remember your wedding day by or a baby shoe charm with your son/daughter’s name engraved on the bottom.  For instance, Christmas may be a big event in your family. If so, make it a day filled with love, laughter, and lots of presents!  , The London bus charm can remind you of the wonderful time you spend there with your family. It will help keep the memories cherished.  You've worked hard to find them, and paid for them, so take this precaution to prevent losing the charms.	Choose a charm bracelet what will fit your lifestyle. Pick a clasp that will suit you. Think about what you want on your charm bracelet. Have charms that symbolize your family. Pick out charms for places you have traveled to. After you have collected all of the charms for your bracelet, bring it in to a jeweler to have them soldered on securely.
Square throw pillows and covers for them are both very easy to sew, if you have a little bit of experience. Choose a firm batting and sew it into a tightly-stitched, stain-resistant pocket made from two pieces of identical cloth. Sew three sides first, stuff, check for evenness, and then sew up the last side. Slipcovers are a great way to add zest and character to your new pillows. Choose bold, fun fabrics with an eye to the décor of the room as a whole.   More complex slipcovers (such as those with ruffles and textured covers) can be made by following patterns available online or in fabric stores. A crazy-quilt slipcover can add a rustic Americana feel to the room, and is easy to make with fabric scraps and a bit of patience.  A wooden headboard is essentially just a big palette for your sense of style, if you want it to be. Lightly sand, prime, and repaint it however you want, or stitch together a cloth cover for it to change both its color and its reflectiveness quickly. Use stencils to add shapes in a contrasting color, such as leaves or birds.   Even more whimsical designs are possible, using fancy fabrics and crafting supplies. Try gluing seashells and a bit of craft sand to the board, and then covering the top part with ragged fishing net cloth to make a seaside look, for example.  Dedicated light fixtures are expensive and time-consuming to install, but portable and temporary solutions can dress up a room just as well. Use stick-on lights to illuminate kitchen cabinets or closets with the touch of your hand, or staple rope lights along the ceiling seam for an elegant and fun lighting option that's perfect for watching movies, having a romantic dinner, or spending time with a loved one in the bedroom. Rope lights are also useful for softly illuminating pantries and coat closets from above the door frame.   Simple Christmas lights can be used for beautiful illuminated garlands that add a touch of class to a living room or front room. Buy small lights all in one color; white is best for its versatility, but other colors may also be acceptable. Go to your local craft store and buy decorative garlands, preferably with a wire core. Wrap the lights in a spiral around the garlands and nail or staple the finished garland to the wall around a door frame or along the ceiling seam.  Change your garland with the seasons. Use a pine bough motif with berries and pine cones for winter, red and orange maple leaves for fall, and so on. Plug it into a wall outlet for an instant, dramatic effect.  A crochet rug is easy to make, and can combine any colors you want for a homey, personalized look. It's also a great way to recycle old T-shirts or bedsheets. Alternatively, try stenciling a pattern onto a plain area rug with durable fabric paint to make it more dramatic and interesting to look at.   Mats for the bathroom or front door can also be stenciled for a new look. Whenever you stencil a rug or mat, be sure to thin the paint first – it doesn't take much to produce a vibrant effect.	Sew your own pillows. Redesign headboards in bedrooms. Add inexpensive, dramatic lighting. Tie the room together with a homemade rug.
Detached tubs hearken back to a time when indoor plumbing was scarce. As such, built-in tubs were rare. The claw-foot tub is a classic design, and smooth porcelain was one of the most popular materials for early tubs due to the fact that it is an easy surface to clean.; , Like detached tubs, detached pedestal sinks recall an era before the widespread use of indoor plumbing. Select a curvy design to give your bathroom a Victorian look or a straight-edged, boxy design if you want to give your bathroom a Craftsman look, which is the style that immediately followed the Victorian era. If you don't want to lose storage space, consider retrofitting an antique dresser into a bathroom vanity.  The earliest toilets did not have a built-in tank. Instead, the tank and the bowl were separate, and the tank usually hung on the wall high about the wall. The handle was attached to the tank by a long metal chain.  Chrome and other shiny metals tend to create a modern ambiance. For a vintage style, opt for dull metals instead, like copper, wrought iron, nickel, and oiled bronze.	Install a claw-foot porcelain tub. Go with a pedestal sink. Include a toilet with a detached tank and chain handle. Look for the right metals.
Although in some situations you may need to expand your crafting repertoire, the best and most efficient way to contribute crafts to someone in need is to do what you already know. For example, a quilt guild may make quilts and jewelry makers should choose to make jewelry.   Try doing an Internet search that includes your craft and "for charity" in the search terms. This will give you examples of charities and what other people have done.; ,   Before donating crafts or money to a charity, ensure that it is authentic. You can check this at http://charitynavigator.org.  Many groups like to dedicate 1 month each year or a few weekends to making crafts to send to an organization they support. The more people who get involved, the more help you will be.  Consider creating a group that crafts for charity that includes teenagers or elderly people. A charity crafting class could be a mother/daughter operation, or it could take place at a retirement community. Many elderly people knit, crochet or embroider and may be interested in meeting with people who are of a different generation.  Most charities have instructions about the sizes of the crafts that are made, the materials and, in some cases, the patterns. Although most crafters love to be creative, make sure you are doing it within the confines of these instructions.  Corporate responsibility leads many large stores to look for charities to support, while local small businesses may enjoy both the ethical and marketing benefits of donating materials to a charity crafting group.   In most cases it is unlikely that all materials would be donated. You should expect to have to buy some materials. If you have a group, then you can share the burden of costs as well as time creating the project.  For example, October is breast cancer awareness month, so you could contribute to a charity and use pink material, and December is AIDS awareness month, so a red craft for an AIDS charity might be preferable. You can increase your craft knowledge while contributing to a number of charities.	Choose your craft. Find an organization that aligns with your craft and the part of society you would like to help. Ask your friends or crafting group if they would like to join you in giving to charity. Get instructions from the charity of your choice before beginning. Ask a local craft store if they want to donate supplies. Rotate your charitable crafts.
We already have a general theme "Holidays!". Although, what type of holidays? Is it maybe Easter Holidays, or Christmas holidays? It is up to you! In this article we will focus on making a Christmas theme bracelet, but you can easily change the colours to suit your holiday!; , Colours are very important in a bracelet, and they should suit the theme. Probably the first things that come in mind for "colours on Christmas" would be green and red, and maybe gold. These are great colours and complement Christmas decorations/clothes.   Remember your colour theme for the next step.  Searching for the right beads are sometimes hard, which is why you must plan, because planning prepares you. First, have a look around the selection of beads that match your colour choice, and think of a plan in your head. What do you want your bracelet to look like? Will it have big beads and small beads, will it follow a pattern, or will it have a small charm in the middle, then follow red and green small beads?  , Before purchasing the beads, visualize some different variations of the bracelet you would like to make, then buy the beads when/if you are sure you are happy with the selection you have. It is a good idea to buy a bit more beads than what you need in case you switch ideas for the bracelet, but remember do not over-buy beads!  , Hopefully your beads are still in separate little baggies.   Do not dump them all into a big container! It will be hard to find them!  , Find the centre of your piece: On the string you are using for the bracelet, find the centre to use for separation, or where you will put a charm in the middle. No matter the design, it is good to know the centre. Pattern or no pattern? Choose if you like a pattern on your bracelet like "red, green, gold, OR red, red, green, green, gold, gold. No matter what the pattern it should be repetitive and you should not stop halfway through. Continue the pattern all the way. Plain is a choice: Sometimes, less is more! Some simple bracelets look beautiful, especially if you use a three stranded bracelet (which is a bit more difficult) and use 1 row of red, another of green and last of gold, but that is up to you!  , Now that you are ready to start, make sure you know who you are making the bracelet for, so you have enough string. Maybe measure their other bracelets, and leave a bit more space in case you need it. Remember, if you have too little string, you cannot add more, but if you have too much, you can always cut it!  , The process of making a bracelet is hard, so prepare to be patient and take some breaks once in a while!  , You can begin by tying a knot on the beginning of the piece, then continuing with beading. Stop every now and then to check out how your pattern is going. Remember to check the middle!  , Once the bracelet is done, secure the ends in whichever method you use, or get a grown -up to help you do the ends. Wrap up the present and it is ready!	Choose a theme. Choose colours. Look for beads. Visualize. Prepare a little workspace where you will start. Then, start with planning:   Your bracelet should be balanced: Do not have huge beads on one side, and small beads on another, because that is not balanced and will most likely look bad. Start the bracelet. Be patient. Start. Done!
If your can does not allow water to drain, the potatoes will rot. Holes can be drilled or cut with a small saw. Drill as many holes as possible without making the trash can bottom too weak to hold in soil.; , Once the drainage holes are drilled, you can begin adding soil. It is best to use potting mix rather than soil from your garden, as potting mix produces the best results when container gardening. Begin by adding a layer about 10 inches (25 cm) deep.   You can mix in fertilizer if desired. A low-nitrogen fertilizer should be used, as high levels of nitrogen promote leaf growth at the expense of potato size. A "5-10-10" mix works well; this indicates that the fertilizer contains 5 parts nitrogen to 10 parts each phosphorous and potassium.  Small potatoes can be planted whole, but larger ones should be cut into smaller pieces. Each piece should have at least 3 "eyes," or dimples. After cutting the potatoes, allow the cut edges to air dry before planting.  Bury the seed potatoes about 4 inches (10 cm) under the potting mix. In a 32 gallon (120 L) garbage can, you should only need about 4 potatoes, spaced evenly apart. Place the garbage can into an area that receives direct sunlight for 4 to 6 hours a day.   Keep the soil moist as the potatoes grow. In mid-summer, you may have to water the potatoes once a day to keep the soil from drying out.  When the potato plants start growing, you should continually add potting mix to the garbage can to cover the plants' stems, making sure to leave the leaves exposed to the sun. This allows more room underneath the soil for new potatoes to grow.   You should continually build up this hill of soil throughout the growing season. This is why the trash can is such an effective vessel - it allows for plenty of vertical room to continually bury the plants' stems.  At the end of the growing season, you simply have to lay down a tarp and overturn the trash can onto it. You can then pick the potatoes off of the tarp. Do not reuse the potting mix for growing potatoes again, as this will make the plants more susceptible to disease.	Drill holes in the bottom of the trash can for drainage. Add a layer of potting mix to the trash can. Prepare your potatoes for planting. Plant the potatoes. Add more potting mix as the plants grow. Harvest the potatoes when they're ready.
As soon as you realize your apple tree needs pruning, it can be tempting to jump to it and start lopping off branches immediately. However, it is important to prune at the right time to avoid damaging your tree. Prune in the first month or two of spring, at least two weeks after the last frost.          If you need to, pruning can occur later in the spring and early in the summer. Avoid pruning in the fall, as new growth will be stimulated but will die off from the cold of winter.; , A well pruned healthy apple tree will be a poor shade tree; it should have significant spacing between branches.  Pruning requires some specific tools in order to prevent damage to the tree. The blades you use to cut branches should be proportional in size to the branches you cut. For small limbs, use hand pruners. Larger branches that are about 1” thick can be cut off with loppers. Use a saw (a folding saw works well) to cut any branches wider than 3”.  If your apple tree is a good shade tree, then it is an obvious candidate for pruning. However, pruning should not be done on all trees. Hold off on heavy pruning until your tree is at least three years old. If a significant amount of pruning needs to be done for a tree, do portions of it over several seasons.          Pruning young or small trees is done to encourage a strong framework and starting shape. Pruning large or matured trees encourages larger, healthier fruit and maintains the overall shape.	Know when to prune. Decide how much you need to prune. Get the right tools. Know which trees to prune.
If put in the kiln, this will probably make it explode. As outlined in the Wheel Throwing section, slam your clay on plaster (absorbs wetness) and knead it like bread.   If you'd like to check the insides to be sure, take a wire and cut it in half. If bubbles are still present, persist.  When you're hand building, there are generally three methods you can employ. Each creates a very different look. Slab works best for large pieces.           Pinch pots: Begin a pinch pot by forming a lump of clay into a smooth sphere that fits the size of the hand. This method is similar to the way the Native Americans shaped clay into useful pots. While holding the sphere of clay, press the thumb into the center of the ball, half-way to the bottom. While revolving the ball in one hand, press the walls out evenly with the thumb into the inside and the fingers on the outside. Smooth the surface with a damp sponge.  Coil Method: Coils of clay can be used to build bowls, vases and other forms in various shapes and sizes. Keeping the fingers flat, form the clay into sausage shapes, then roll into ropes 1⁄4 to 1⁄2 inch (0.6 to 1.3 cm) thick. Make a shallow dish with the pinch pot method and turn up-side down to serve as a foot of base. Place a coil along the edge of the foot. Dampen the fingers and join the next coil to it, with a little pressure. Keep adding coils. Coils may be pressed with the fingers or a tool on both the inside and outside to create interesting texture.  Slab Method: Place two strips of wood on canvas a little further apart than the width of the finished slabs. Working on a textured fabric will leave imprints on the clay slab. Place clay on the cloth between the strips of wood and roll out. Use a pointed tool to trim the slab of clay to desired size. You may make paper patterns to follow if a form that has a number of sides is desired. Rub a wet finger over the edges to be joined and score with a tool. Roll out a thin coil of sticky clay and place it along one edge. Press the two edges together. Slabs of clay may be placed over rocks, bowls, plastic forms etc. to create interesting shapes. As the clay dries, it shrinks away from the form but retains the shape of the form.If it is a medium or larger piece, make it hollow. Solid clay takes an eternity to dry and will explode in a firing most of the time.	Make sure that your clay has no bubbles in it. Pinch, coil or slab.

This can be found either from information in your owner's manual or on the Internet.  You should refer to your electrical schematic for help. You want to make sure that there are no breaks in the connection from the fuse box to the switch. If you did not find a schematic, it might be easier to trace the wiring from the switch back to the fuse box to look for any breaks in the connection., Attach the leads of the multi-meter to where the electrical wires come into the switch and set the meter to D/C volts. It should read 12 volts.  This is the path that a signal will travel to move your window when you press the switch. Any breaks or loose connections in this path will prevent your motor from functioning properly., Attach the leads of the multi-meter to where the electrical wires come into the motor. Again, set it to D/C volts and it should read 12 volts.  If there are any loose or corroded connections in the circuit they will disrupt the signal and cause your window to malfunction.  Push any connectors or wiring harnesses together tightly, and clean any corrosion away with a wire brush or similar tool. .  If your problem was in the circuitry and is now fixed, then your window should freely roll up and down without any restrictions or delays.	Find an electrical schematic of your vehicle. Trace the wiring from the fuse panel to the switch. Use a multi-meter to confirm that the switch is getting 12V of power. Trace the wiring from the switch to the motor. Use the multi-meter to confirm that the motor is getting 12V of power. Look for any interrupted voltage caused by a loose connector or corrosion. Fix the connector or corroded areas. Test the window again.
The leak will generally come from the discharge hose at the standpipe in the wall. Are there water stains running down the wall? Perhaps, when you turn the machine to drain, water comes out of the standpipe. Adjust the drainage hose if you suspect an obstructed flow or stopped up drain. Another common water leak can be a bad hose or loose connection. Pull out the washing machine and turn it on, allowing water to flow into the tub. Check at the back to ensure there are no cuts in the hose or at the connections as the tub fills. There are two hoses that are part of the cycle system. Check as it cycles to verify the clamps and hoses are in good condition.; ,   You need to remove the bottom panel from the washing machine using a Phillips head screwdriver. Possible leaks can be hidden under the washtub.  This would make water come from around the top of the washtub during the spin cycle.   Raise the top of the washing machine to check the gasket. It is normally held in place with two clips in the front. Insert a thin-bladed flat head screwdriver and pry the top up. The two clips are at the back and act like hinges. With the top up, visually inspect the gasket around the top of the tub for cracks, dirt or anything else that would keep it from sealing off the water.	Check where on the washer the leak is coming from. Get on the floor to check the bottom and back of the washing machine as it cycles through. Confirm whether you have a worn out gasket.
The term “RV” applies to a number of different types of vehicle, including Class A and Class C motorhomes, travel trailers, fifth wheels, and toy haulers. Think about what you will be using your RV for and plan accordingly. You can still compare across types, but knowing generally what you want can help narrow your search and save you time and effort.; , There are a number of different sites that have information about different manufacturers. However, you will usually have to pay a fee to get more complete information. But it is still worth a try with a free guide, because it might have just the information you are looking for.   A good place to start is http://www.nadaguides.com/rvs. This site has information about a huge number of different brands and models going back a number of years.  There are a number of different consumer guides available that compare a large number of different brands and models. These guides often include the vehicle specs and recommended pricing information. While they can cost about $100, they can save you a good deal of money and stress in the long run.   Two popular guides can be purchased at the following sites:   JR Consumer. This site offers a complete guide in both ebook ($68) and hardcopy ($78) formats, as well as a number of supplementary products. The guides provide information about make and model, price, value, and customer satisfaction. The guides only include information about 3 or 4 model years, so if you are looking for an older RV, make sure to purchase the appropriate guide.  RV Consumer Group. This non-profit site offers guides for individual purchase ($78), or memberships that include a package of informational products ($139). The guide offers information about price, reliability, value, control, and vehicle specs.  You can do an Internet search for something general, like “RV reviews,” or for a specific brand or model if you have something in mind.   Forums have the benefit of being free, but they do not usually have extremely specific information about a wide variety of models in a single place. Forums can be especially useful once you have narrowed your search.  If you have friends who have purchased RVs before, ask them about their experiences. Are they satisfied with the RV they purchased? Would they recommend a different manufacturer? The more information you have, the better, so ask around as much as you can.  When you feel that you are ready to actually go to an RV dealer, ask him or her for recommendations. Chances are, they will have good information about customer satisfaction from previous buyers. They may be able to give you information that you were not able to get from a consumer guide or online forum. It never hurts to get more first-hand information, so don’t be afraid to ask.	Do some research about the type of RV you want. Search for online consumer guides. Purchase a consumer guide. Read online forums. Talk to friends. Talk to your dealer.
Since you won't be doing any sewing for this, you want to find a fabric that does not fray, such as felt or flannel. Jersey/t-shirt fabric and tulle also make great choices.   This will create a child-sized cape. You can use larger measurements to make an adult cape.  Measure down from your child's neck down to where you want the cape to end. Add 2 to 3 inches (5.08 to 7.62 centimeters) to your measurement. Cut the fabric according to that measurement.The cape can be as wide as you want it to be.  Turn the fabric so that the wrong side is facing you. Fold the top edge down by 2 to 3 inches (5.08 to 7.62 centimeters) to make the casing. Secure the bottom edge with fabric glue or iron-on hem tape.Hot glue is not recommended for this because it is not flexible enough to gather. If you do know how to sew, you can sew the casing down, ¼-inch (0.64-centimeter) from the bottom edge.  It can be the same color as the cape, or a contrasting one. Something between 1 and 2 inches (2.54 and 5.08 centimeters) would work best.  If you want to tie the ribbon into a bow, cut it twice the length as the casing. You can also use a piece of silver or gold cording instead.  Secure a safety pin to one end of the ribbon. Use the safety pin to pull the ribbon through the casing., Slide the cape so that it is centered on the ribbon. Next, scrunch the cape on the ribbon so that it gathers. It should be about half the width it used to be., Cut the ribbon down to 3 inches (7.62 centimeters) on each side. Seal the ends with a lighter to keep them from fraying.  If you will be tying the ribbon into a bow, skip this step.  Place one Velcro closure on the front of one ribbon, and the other on the back of the other ribbon. Self-adhesive Velcro would work best. If you can't find any, you can glue on the regular kind with hot glue or fabric glue.  Consider hot gluing some pretty rhinestones over the front of one ribbon to make it fancier. If you left the ribbon long, cut the ends at angles, then seal them with a lighter. If you used cording instead of a ribbon, tie a knot into each end of the cord to keep it from fraying.  You can leave your cape as is, or you can add some finishing touches, such as rhinestones or paint. Use colors that go well with your cape, and remember, less is more. Here are some ideas to get you started:Paint on designs using fabric glue or puff paint. You can free-hand them or use fabric stencils. Use iron-on transfers to add designs to your cape. Glue rhinestones along the edges using fabric glue or hot glue. Use fusible web interfacing to glue appliqués onto the cape. Hot glue a feather boa to the bottom of the cape.	Choose your fabric. Cut the fabric to length. Make the casing. Cut a piece of ribbon that's just a little longer than the casing. Pull the ribbon through the casing. Scrunch the cape to gather it. Trim the ribbon down to make the closure. Add Velcro closures to the ribbon. Add the finishing touches.
Whether you rubbed oil or grease on your interior ultimately doesn’t matter for cleanup purposes. Here’s why:   Oils are defined as any compounds that are insoluble in water, soluble in organic solvents (non-polar things like gasoline), and liquid at room temperature.Grease, on the other hand, is simply an oil that has additives to make it semi-solid (kind of like Jell-O) at room temperature. These additives are solid and do not absorb into the surfaces inside your car.This means that, once you scrape off any excess contaminants from the surface of your interior, the stain left behind is an oil stain. Cleaning oil from cloth seats requires the same process you would use to clean it from carpet.; , You can use a paint scraper, spoon, or knife. It doesn’t matter if you use metal or plastic, but be cautious not to puncture your seat., This will remove any residual oil or grease that is left sitting on the surface of your interior. Use a dry paper towel or shop towel to do this., This will soak up the oil. Allow the baking soda to sit for 10-15 minutes., You can vacuum it up with a shopvac or sweep it up. If there is a large amount of oil, you might put more baking soda on the stain and repeat this cycle several times., If there is any stain left, you can repeat the process as long as you continue to see improvement. Instructions for sponging and blotting with a particular dry cleaner will be included on the manufacturer's bottle. Once you can no longer tell that this method is making a difference, you should move on to another method., A detergent such as Dawn is often enough to break up oil stains, especially fresh ones. You can also buy other over the counter grease/oil removers such as Goo Gone. This is the most common and straightforward way to remove a grease or oil stain., If a degreaser didn’t knock out the stain, you may need to use steam to coax it out. The steam will heat the fibers of your carpet and open up any pores in the fiber. This allows the carpet to “release” any trapped oil and gives you the chance to soak it up.   You can use a traditional steam cleaner to do this job. If you do not have a steam cleaner, you can place a brown paper bag over the stain to absorb the oils. Then, apply steam by putting a clothing iron on top of the bag to create the heat and steam to free the oils.	Understand the enemy. Scrape off any excess oil or grease. Blot the stain. Apply baking soda to the stain. Remove the baking soda. Clean the carpet with dry cleaning solvent if residual stains remain. Scrub with a degreaser. Steam the stained area.
A single horn generally has one main tuning slide. To locate this tuning slide, follow the tubing of your horn from the mouthpiece until you arrive at a tuning slide. This is your main tuning slide.   If your horn has more than one tuning slide, you likely have a double horn and you will also need to adjust the B flat tuning slide.; , Play your instrument for at least 3 to 5 minutes, going through scales or practicing musical and fingering patterns or even just blowing warm air through the instrument, a cold instrument never plays as well, this is all to warm up your own playing as well as the instrument. Also cold air temperature will make an instrument react and play differently, tending towards playing flat. The instrument will also warm up as you play, and the tone will shift slightly and become more predictable., In order to match the tune that the rest of the orchestra or ensemble is playing, match your tone to a consistent tuner (usually the oboe), it is best if the other hornists in your ensemble are there and you can all match the same pitch. Alternately, use a bar or electric tuner, tuning fork or even a well tuned piano.  The approximate position for the main tuning slide is about ¼ inch to ½ inch out. With the tuning slide all the way in, the notes should sound sharp, with it all the way to it is flat. You can listen to your tuner's pitch and yours to determine if you are sharp or flat.  If the piano is playing F above middle C, play the corresponding open note (meaning there are no valves being pressed). Play the third C that would correspond with the middle C on a “horn in F.”, You will want to tune the horn to match the sounds that will emerge when you play it in performance. Keep the positioning and size of your hand’s coverage in the bell consistent as you tune.  As you play this open note with the piano or other tuning instrument, you will hear if your note is flat (below the note) or sharp (above the note). Pull the tuning slide out to draw down sharp tones, or push the slide in to push up flat notes. It might take practice to hear if your pitch is right or wrong, it is a difference but it seems small at first Even though these are minor adjustments, they do impact how much air must travel through the horn and therefore impact how the tone sounds.  If you are playing a double horn, your next step is to tune the horn so that it’s in tune with itself.Press the thumb valve to switch over to the horn’s B flat side. Play F again above middle C on piano. Slide between the F and Bb on the horn. Leave the main tuning slide alone and only adjust the Bb tuning slide the same way as the F slide.  You have now tuned the open note (notes played with no valves pressed down). Now you need to tune closed notes, or those that are played while pressing valves down. You can use an electronic tuner, piano, tuning fork, or similar instrument to help you, but you can also use your ear to listen for sharp or flat notes.   Play your middle C, which you just tuned. This should be perfectly in pitch now. Play either fourths, fifths or an octave above the tuned middle C for each valve. For example, to tune first valve, play F above your middle C. It is much easier to compare notes with middle C and hear the intonation between notes that are distant from each other, such as an octave apart. Adjust the valve tuner for each valve note you play to sharpen or flatten the note. To sharpen, push the slide valve tuner in. To flatten, slide the valve tuner out. Repeat for each valve.For a double horn, you should have six valves (three on the F side and three on the B flat side).  If you have pulled out all the tuning slides and the horn is still sounding too sharp, then you likely need to provide more coverage with your right hand inside the horn’s bell. Similarly, if you have pushed in the slides all the way and you are still flat, then you will need to adjust how much of your hand is inside the bell, instead making the coverage area smaller., Mark the slides after you’ve tuned and adjusted the slide. This will give you a good indication of where the slide should sit to be in tune, although you will still need to tune your horn in comparison to the other instruments with which you are playing.   Marking your slides is especially useful for when you need to empty condensation or saliva from the horn in the middle of a performance. Emptying condensation will usually throw off the pitch a bit. To offset this, make sure you take note of where you’ve put the valve mark so you can return the tuning slide to the correct location quickly. Alternately, you can measure where the tuning slide sits with your fingernail or knuckle and easily return the slide to its proper location after emptying condensation.  The complexity of the French horn is such that you cannot achieve perfect pitch for every note. You will need to compromise by choosing the middle ground on tuning.	Locate your tuning slide(s). Warm up your instrument. Use a tuning instrument to play an F above middle C. Tune your horn to match the arrangement in which you’re playing. Listen to see if you match pitch. Play the horn to match the tuning instrument’s note. Keep your right hand in the horn’s bell. Adjust the main F tuning slide. Tune the B flat slide. Tune the horn’s closed notes. Ensure you have enough coverage with your hand in the bell. Mark your tuning slides with a soft-leaded pencil. Be ready to compromise.
Use a glass cleaner and some paper towels to clean the inside of the window before beginning to paint the frame. This will keep any dust and dirt that may be gathered on the window from getting into the paint.  Use painter's tape to cover any hardware or areas that are not meant to be painted, such as hinges, locks and catches. If removing these items is easier than covering them with tape, take them off the window and set them aside., Prevent paint from getting onto the glass by taping off the window with painter's tape., Muntins are horizontal pieces of wood going across the window. Paint them slowly with a small paintbrush, making even strokes across the wood from 1 end of the window to the other., Using the same strokes and brush as on the muntins, paint the top and bottom horizontal pieces of the window pane.,,,, Do this while the paint is in the process of drying. If the tape is not removed until after it the paint is completely dry, it can chip paint off the window frame., This may take up to 24 hours to dry completely., Use a paint scraper to gently rub away at any paint marks that are on the window. If the paint scraper is too large to manage or reach the corners, try using a small razor blade.,	Clean the window. Tape the hardware. Tape the window. Paint any muntins. Paint the horizontal pieces.Paint the vertical cross pieces.Paint any additional top, bottom or side pieces of wood that are on the window pane.Paint the window molding. Remove the painter's tape from the glass and hardware. Allow the paint to dry on the window frame. Scrape off any paint that landed on the glass.Once the paint is dry, replace any hardware that was removed before the window painting process.
Cut a rectangle around your traced blade to separate it from the main slab. You will need a stiffer hacksaw for thicker steel. This rectangle is what you will grind down to form the profile of the blade.  Put the rough cut blade into a vise and grind away excess metal. Follow the guidelines to form the profile. Use the grinder to finalize the shape of the blade.  Gently grind the edge into a slope with the flap wheel. Make sure that the slope does not go past the middle of the blade. Make this slope on each side of the blade. Doing this forms the actual edge of the blade.   Go slowly during this step, as grinding too much can ruin the blade, forcing you to start over.  Use a drill bit that is the same size as the rivets that you intend to use. Put the holes in the tang. Depending on the size of the blade, you may need a varying number of holes.  Sand the blade using successively finer grits of sandpaper, up to 220 grit. Be sure to take the time to sand out any scratches. Sand all areas of the blade. This will increase its luster and quality.   Sand in opposite directions each time you change grits. You can use a file to add ridges to the inside near the handle. Trace a pattern and file the metal away.	Use the hacksaw to cut the metal. Grind the profile. Grind the edge. Drill your rivet holes. Finish the blade.
If you take a cutting, choose one with a lot of roots on it. This can be planted straight into the garden as they root extremely easily.; , Vietnamese mint will grow best in well-draining, fertile soil that stays moist. Add some well-rotted manure or compost to enrich the soil if needed. Choose an area with bright dappled shade, and where it will definitely get shade during the hottest part of the day.  The mint needs lots of water to establish well.   This plant grows fast so you might want to consider containing it within a container.  Remember that it's tropical, so it needs a wet season, or a simulation of one.  A soluble fertiliser with a high proportion of nitrogen or a complete plant food is ideal, given occasionally during the spring and summer months.  Vietnamese mint grows rapidly and is ready for harvesting within a month, so it needs to be pruned regularly to keep its rampant growth in check.  The leaves are best between spring and autumn but can be harvested all year. Harvesting can begin about 4-6 weeks after the initial planting.  Vietnamese mint is excellent washed, chopped, and added to salads and Thai and Vietnamese dishes. It's a far more authentic addition to cold/fresh spring rolls than common mint. It is best used fresh.	Take a cutting or purchase seeds or a seedling from the local nursery. Prepare the soil. Plant early spring or during the wet season. Water well and frequently. Fertilise. Prune regularly. Harvest. Use.
Extend your arm straight out so that it is perpendicular to the rest of your body.   You can work with either the left or right arm. It is easiest to take an accurate measurement for your Armhole if you have a second person helping you. Your helper will need to use the tape measure while you keep your arm in position. If you do not have a helper to assist you, it might be easiest to measure the Armhole of your non-dominant arm while using your dominant hand to hold and maneuver the tape measure. You should stand in front of a full-length mirror, as well.; , Position the starting (zero) end of the tape measure flat against the the center of your shoulder. Draw the tape measure down over the front of your shoulder and arm, pausing once it hits the center of your armpit.   This measurement is sometimes referred to as your Armhole depth.It is not a full Armhole measurement, however, so you should keep going if you need the full measurement instead of the depth measurement. Keep the tape measure flat against your body. It should also be vertically straight along the front of your body.  Continue wrapping the tape measure around your arm and shoulder, drawing it up from behind your shoulder until it meets the starting end.This measurement is your full Armhole measurement. The tape measure must be vertically straight along the back and front of your shoulder. Make sure that it also lies flat against your body. Note that your full Armhole measurement should be twice as large as your Armhole depth. Since it may not be exactly twice as large, though, it is best to take the actual measurement instead of mathematically doubling the depth measurement.  With the tape measure held in place, move your arm around. Rotate it back and forth, then up and down. The tape measure should not be tight enough to restrict the movement of your arm in any way.   As a general rule, place two fingers underneath the measuring tape and against your body as you take the measurement. Do not stretch the tape, either. Following these two precautions should prevent the Armhole from being too tight.When in doubt, a measurement that is slightly too large is better than one that is too small.	Raise your arm. Wrap the tape measure from the shoulder to the armpit. Wrap the tape measure back up to the shoulder. Keep it comfortable.
Place the nylon in a bucket and cover it with lukewarm water. Allow it to soak overnight, or for at least eight hours.   Soaking the nylon makes it easier for the dye to penetrate its fibers, and a long soak will ensure that the fibers are evenly drenched. With chemical dyes, warm to hot water is necessary, but room temperature water will suffice for food coloring dye.  Add warm water to a large saucepan or stockpot until it is one-half to two-thirds full. Mix your chosen food coloring into this water, stirring until evenly combined.   Make sure that you have a large enough pot and enough water for the amount of nylon being dyed. Test the pot size before you add the water by stuffing the nylon inside. The nylon fill no more than one-quarter of the pot. You will need about 1 qt (1 L) of water for every 1/4 lb (110 g) or less of nylon. For instance, if you are dyeing one pair of nylon stockings, 1 qt (1 L) of water will usually suffice. The right amount of food coloring can be tricky to determine. For a vibrant color, you will need at least 10 drops for every 1 cup (250 ml) of water. Vary the amount as desired to lighten or deepen the shade.  Add the nylon to the dye bath, making sure that it is completely submerged. The dye bath must be allowed to soak into all the fibers of the material.   Stir the nylon as it sits in the dye bath. You will need to stir it almost constantly throughout the entire dyeing process if you want to maintain an even color.  Place the saucepan on the stove and heat it on medium until the dye bath reaches a temperature of 180 degrees Fahrenheit (82 degrees Celsius).The dyeing process is almost always triggered by heat, no matter what kind of dye you use. If you want the dye to be its brightest and most vibrant, this is the minimum temperature you will need the dye bath to reach. Do not allow the dye bath to reach a rolling boil, however.  Pour a little white vinegar into the dye bath, mixing it in gently. Vinegar will help the color set into the nylon.   The amount of vinegar also varies based on the amount of water you use. As a general rule, use 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of white vinegar for every 1 cup (250 ml) of water in your dye bath., Turn the heat source off and remove the pan from the stove. Allow it to sit until the dye bath cools to room temperature. Do not remove the nylon during this time.   The water will be close to clear when the nylon is done dyeing. If you do not notice a change in the color of the water after 20 to 30 minutes, place the pan back on the stove and heat it again to reactivate the dyeing process.  Take the nylon to a large sink and rinse it under warm, running water until the water runs clear., Gently squeeze the excess water out the material using your hands, but do not wring the material out since doing so can damage the fibers. Allow the nylon to sit out flat or hang in a warm location with good air circulation until fully dry.   You may need to gently stretch the nylon as it dries if you want the material to lie flat. If you allow the nylon to dry without stretching it, the end result will likely have wrinkles.	Soak the nylon. Mix the dye bath. Dunk the nylon in the dye bath. Heat the bath. Add vinegar. Cool the dye bath. Rinse the nylon. Let the nylon dry.
You may love a character, and think you could cosplay her perfectly, but if she’s not very well known, you’re not likely to get much of a response from other people. The best characters to cosplay as are iconic and distinctive. They don't need to be the most well-known characters, but you will want at least a fraction of convention attendees to know who you're playing as.   If being seen as attractive is your priority, think about which characters members of the fan community are most attracted to, and which ones you find most beautiful.; , Cosplay means costume art to some, but truly dedicated cosplayers act out their character. This requires having a solid knowledge of the character's motivations, history and psychology.Look into the source material and give yourself a crash course in the character. Ask yourself questions and try to answer them yourself. What is her darkest secret? How would she react to a stranger? What hobbies does she have? These may not have a big effect on the character's personality, but it helps you get into the proper mindset.   For example, if you're going as Rei Ayanami from the Neon Genesis Evangelion universe, it helps to watch the show closer to the date of the convention. Observe the way she is animated, and pay attention to her character arc. A good cosplayer might simply act shy and mysterious, but the best cosplayers will try to get into the actual mindset of the character.  To be a great cosplayer, you should be able to capture the essence of your character in a single pose. Without movement or talking, frame your body in such a way that expresses something of the character's personality. Practice some poses in front of the mirror and see if something sticks. If you're having a trouble finding one that really works, try looking up artwork or promo photos for the character you're cosplaying as and copy it.   For instance, an action-based character like someone from the Kingdom Hearts series may suit a battle-ready stance. On the other hand, a schoolgirl-type character from the shojo manga Love Hina. Anime characters are often boldly characterized, so it shouldn't be difficult to pinpoint the dominant mood for the character you're going as.  Poses are best-suited for photo ops. If your costume is impressive enough, you're bound to get a lot of attention. Having a few good poses will maximize how good you look in photos., Dressing up as an attractive anime girl can be an open invitation for some of these less desirable types. If someone like this approaches you or makes a comment you're not comfortable with, the best thing you can do is ignore it and walk away. Nothing breaks character like genuine stress, and you don't want negative feelings to get in the way of your convention experience.   If someone is persistently harassing you, it's a good idea to contact security.  Cosplay if ultimately about expressing yourself, and the best way to do that is through confidence. If you're confident about what you're doing, the cosplay act will come more naturally. Of course, this may be easier said than done for a lot of people. Confidence is not the sort of thing that happens overnight. Nonetheless, you should pat yourself on the back for the fact alone you are putting yourself out there via cosplay. Cosplay takes courage, and simply being interested in doing it means you've got what it takes.  One of the great things about cosplay is that it is a communal activity. Chances are there are others who have cosplayed as the same anime character you've chosen. Looking online at sites like Cosplay.com and Kotaku will yield lots of inspiration.Take a look at the details in costumes you see. Are there any liberties taken with the source material? Any effective makeup techniques? In the end, you want to be your own attractive anime girl, but it doesn't hurt to lean on the innovations of others when you find yourself stuck.   Some cosplayers combine characters for a hybrid cosplay. This is only recommended if you really know what you're doing., Find some pictures of your chosen anime character for reference. From there, you should be able to break down what you need for the costume. Some costumes are easier to put together than others. Many anime characters use a "schoolgirl" aesthetic; the clothes for costumes like this can be purchased at stores. More elaborate designs will require sewing on your part. If you want to have an attractive costume, it's important that your costume shows off your figure. This doesn't necessarily mean wearing a high-cut skirt, but it does mean you should do without costumes that blanket your figure.   If you're in a bind, the Japanese "schoolgirl" outfit is a great pick. Even if you don't end up representing a character in particular, you'll definitely fit in with the crowd.  While it's still recommended you base your costume choices around a certain character, wearing a skirt is a standard look for the Japanese schoolgirl. Many anime girls match this look. Luckily, skirts of this sort can be purchased from a department store, or ordered online.  Boots are a bold type of clothing, and will make your costume more attention-grabbing. Boots already fit into a lot of anime costume designs, but you should choose your footwear to suit the character you've chosen.   If you're going for a schoolgirl look, boots may be too assertive. Cosplay costumes can get incredibly expensive. When you're first starting out, it's recommended you try to keep costs to a minimum. This will make sure you are able to afford other costumes as time goes on. Only seasoned cosplayers should let themselves settle into a single costume.  How you go about making a costume depends on how skilled you as a seamstress. To get a more specific costume for your anime character, you can sew, cut and hem existing pieces of clothing to fit your costume. In most cases, the clothes you use for this purpose will be permanently changed, so it's best to use old clothing you don't normally wear anymore or go shopping at a thrift store., Fabric that is flimsy, stretchy, or shiny tends to be very difficult to sew, which can lead to extremely unflattering costumes. Unless you are an extremely confident sewer, avoid these fabrics.Plain and medium weight fabrics are the easiest for beginners to sew with. Look for natural fabrics like poplin, cotton broadcloth, and lightweight wools.Darker prints make it easier to hide imperfect seams.If you're using patterned fabric, go for a small pattern rather than a large one. A large pattern will need to be matched up at the seams, which is much harder to do., Detailed costumes are great, but if you're in a pinch, you can usually do something simple to make your costume distinctive or recognizable. Depending on your knowledge of anime, you may be able to think of ways to spruce up your look. Even if you only have a schoolgirl costume, adding a Pokeball (from the Pokemon universe) will signal to everyone that you're playing as someone from that world.  Anime is a very distinctive animation style, and the most distinctive thing about it is arguably the way in which eyes are exaggerated. Cosplaying as an anime girl, you can get these bigger eyes with makeup.Pencil your eyes with a white eyeliner, and extend the frame of your eyes using a light-shaded eyeshadow. Eyeshadow should be used to create a new, wider shape for the eyes. Lightly smudge it where the eyeshadow ends for a blended look.   While this is more eyeshadow that you may be used to wearing, the rest of your eye makeup should be kept mild. This will make the bigger eyes more believable. Exceptions should be made if your character suits a different kind of eye makeup.  Because eyes are so important to the anime drawing style, you want to bring as much attention to the eyes as possible. Contact lenses are a quick and relatively affordable way of spicing up your look.Study the design of your character's eyes, and make a judgement call whether you think coloured contacts would fit her loo.  Female characters in anime tend to be very stylized. Many anime girls look like dolls, and makeup should be used to get that look. Blush can get used to get the reddened cheeks of anime characters. You may also want to make your face paler using foundation and concealer. Watch the anime your character is based in if you need specific inspiration for the look. The best cosplays are specifically based around the details of a character.   Makeup is a less important part of cosplaying, so you shouldn't worry about it too much if makeup isn't your forte.  It is recommended that you try to style your hair based on a character. With that said, straightening your hair will give you a more Japanese look. Bangs are also a staple hairstyle in anime. It's recommended you find a picture of your favourite anime character and get a hairstylist to match your hair to it.   Wigs are also a possibility. Suitable wigs for your costume should be available at a costume store.  Cosplay has a very passionate and inclusive community. If you don't already have friends that are into it, it's a good idea to meet some fellow fans. Because it's such a popular subculture, cosplay groups are quite easy to hook up with online.Look for public groups on social media sites like Facebook. If you join up with one of these groups, you can begin making friends by listing some of your favourite animes.  Depending on where you live, some travelling may be required. Cosplay conventions range significantly in size and scope. At first, it is recommended you choose a smaller one. They're less overwhelming, and it's easier to make friends with people when there's less chaos.Conventions usually cost around $20-60 USD to attend per day.  While doing a cosplay project on your own is perfectly fine, many cosplayers find it more enjoyable to go as a group. If you're planning on going to a convention with some friends, you might decide as a group to dress as characters from a certain anime. Theme groups tend to leave a much bigger impression at conventions than individual costumes.   Groups are also safer to go in. Conventions sometimes come with the risk of guys who harass attractive cosplayers. If you're in a group, it'll be easier to keep them at bay.  Some of them may be interested in taking your picture. Although it's usually to be taken as a compliment if someone asks to take your picture, it's ultimately up to you whether you're comfortable for that or not. Politely decline and move on if you're not okay with it.   If you're worried about harassment, going in a group can help alleviate the pressure. It's usually recommended you have a friend there to look out for you in the slight chance there's an issue.  You might not think so at first, but cosplay conventions can be physically exhausting. Walking around and posing all day can have an effect on anyone's fatigue. It's recommended you prepare for a convention day by doing 5-10 minutes of light stretches and warming up before heading in.Stretch out your arms and legs to make sure they're limber. Neck and arm rolls will ease the risk of strain throughout your day.  The most important thing at any convention is that you enjoy yourself. Preparing for a convention can be stressful, and conventions themselves can feel overwhelming at first. Once you get past the worst of it however, they can be a ton of fun. There are many things you can do to maximize your enjoyment of conventions:   Take your own photos.Why wait for others to photograph you? Take photos of yourself and other cosplayers. It's a great way to immortalize the memory. Check out anime booths. There's often a lot of interesting fan merch for sale. If you're a fan of anime, you'll find plenty to love. Taking some money with you to purchase souvenirs can be fun. Socialize and meet people. Everyone at the convention is ultimately there because they share a love of the same artform. This can be the foundation to meet new lifelong friends. Even if lasting friendships don't come out of it, it can still be great to talk shop about common interests.	Choose a recognizable character. Know your character. Plan some poses. Ignore negative attention.Unfortunately, for all of the great things conventions can offer, they are also notorious for attracting haters and creeps. Be confident. Look online for inspiration. Design a costume. Wear a skirt. Aim for colourful boots.Because anime is usually so stylized, characters' shoes tend to be bright and bold. Modify a pattern or existing garment. Use a plain or natural fabric. Make your costume distinctive.In a lot of cases, people are only going to have a few seconds to admire your costume before their gaze turns elsewhere. Enlarge your eyes. Try wearing contact lenses. Rose your cheeks. Straighten and bang your hair.There is no single "anime haircut" for girls. Get into the community. Choose a convention.The idea of going to conventions can be daunting if you haven't made a habit of going already. Consider going in a group. Decide whether you want your photo taken.Some people go to cosplay conventions purely with the interest of checking out other peoples cosplays. Warm up. Have fun!
It’s easier to do this with the paper turned like a diamond. Bring the top point down so that it meets the bottom point. Crease the fold well and unfold the sheet.   A standard 6-inch by 6-inch (15-cm by 15-cm) square of origami paper is perfect for this process. Otherwise, you can cut a typical sheet of printer paper into a square.; , Keeping the sheet oriented as a diamond, fold the left point over until it meets the right point. Crease the paper well before unfolding it back into its original shape.After doing this, your sheet should have two perpendicular crease marks. One should go from the top corner to the bottom, and the other should go between the side corners. The two crease marks should intersect in the center of the paper.  Again, keep the sheet oriented like a diamond rather than a square. Fold the top of the sheet so that the top point meets the center of the paper, where the diagonal creases intersect. Crease the folded edge.  Fold until the bottom point completely covers the folded top point. Crease the new fold. The corner should meet the center of the top edge.Note that there should now be a total of six points: three on the left and three on the right.  Both folds should start at the middle of the sheet’s bottom edge, running parallel to the edges at the bottom corners.Fold the lowest right-hand corner up so that it meets the middle of the upper edge. Repeat this fold with the lowest left-hand corner, bringing it together with the fold made on the right.   Crease both folds well. The bottom edge should now be a point where to diagonal edges meet.  Fold the tips of the two top corners and two side corners inward. You should now have edges instead of corners, completing your heart.	Fold a square piece of paper in half diagonally. Fold the square diagonally in the opposite direction. Fold the top corner down to the center. Fold the bottom corner up to the top edge. Fold the right and left sides towards the center crease. Turn the heart over and fold the points.
Choose two contrasting colors of duct tape to make your bow.  Before you make the bow itself, it is a good idea to cut out a small strip of duct tape (about 0.25 inches, or about 0.64 centimeters, in width) for the centerpiece. This will make it easier to secure the bow later. Stick the strip of duct tape to the edge of a table where you can easily grab it.  Taking the second roll of duct tape, cut out a piece 18 inches (45.7 cm) in length. Fold it neatly in half (lengthwise), sticky sides together, leaving just a small strip of adhesive exposed at the end.  Take both ends of the strip of duct tape and curl them upwards, to form a circle. Stick the ends together, using the small strip of adhesive that you left exposed earlier. The duct tape should now form a circular shape, like a cuff.  Flatten the circle of duct tape and pinch the edges together, in the center, to form a bow shape.  Take the small strip of duct tape you cut out earlier and wrap it tightly around the center of the bow to secure.  Stick it to a headband or barrette for a funky hair piece or attach it to bags, clothing, hats, etc.	Choose your duct tape. Cut out the center piece. Cut out an 18 inch (45.7 cm) strip of duct tape. Stick the ends together. Pinch the center of the circle. Secure the bow. Attach the bow to anything you like!
Otto Link makes an amazing ebonite mouthpiece for jazz, as does Meyer. Vandoren v16 and Java are specifically for jazz, while the V5, as long as it is open, is a great saxophone mouthpiece. Also check out Jody Jazz and the Selmer supper session, as well as the Selmer sd20 All the greats, Charlie Parker, Coltrane, Cannonball, Brecker... used a jazz mouthpiece. Remember, a jazz mouthpiece should be open, for basic jazz from size 6-8 or 9 should work, for big band music, 5-8 should work and for crazy funk and fusion, 7-11. Don't be deceived by players that you can use your classical mouthpiece for jazz.; , jazz reeds are highly recommended and so is a good ligature. Rico Select Jazz reeds are really good, and Vandoren makes four specifically for jazz, The jazz ZZ, Java green, java red, and the V16. The v16 provides a very full sound. Vandoren traditional reeds also work decently for jazz. Hemke reeds are also great for jazz. Smooth jazz star Kenny G uses Hemke reeds. Many websites allow you to buy one reed of a certain type. Do this for several and find the one you like best. It should both sound good and respond easily. The vandoren optimum ligature has a reputation as a classical ligature but if you choose the plate with four points, the reed vibrates to its maximum capability. Also check out the Francois Louis Ultimate ligature. Try to avoid all rovner ligatures, as they dampen the sound WAY to much and have WAY to much contact with the reed.  It is a different form of playing, less control, more unpredictable and " from the soul" It's about grooving, but doing it well.  Play scales in a different way. Get used to articulating and create your sound.  These are Ionian (major), Dorian, Phrygian, lydian, Mixolydian, Aeolian (minor), and Lochrian (in ascending order).  Listening is very important for developing a jazz style. Listen to such greats as Charlie Parker, John Coltrane, Sonny Rollins, Cannonball Adderley, and develop the style you want.

Get jazz reeds. Change your mindset before playing jazz if you already play classical. Learn to swing. Learn the seven modes. Listen. Join a jazz band. Take private lessons.
Use a utility knife or similar tool to cut the paint around the hardware to prevent paint from peeling off with surface to which the hardware is attached. Cut around fasteners and carve paint from their slots with your knife.   Remove fasteners with the appropriate tool and take off the hardware. In most cases, a screwdriver or claw hammer work well for fastener removal., Use an old pot for this. After boiling the hardware, do not re-use this pot for cooking to prevent food from becoming contaminated with paint particles. Fill the pot halfway with water or enough so the hardware is completely covered. Boil hardware for 10 to 20 minutes.For especially thick or stubborn paint, you may want to use a longer boiling time. Boil your hardware for a few hours for best results. A quart (950 ml) of water mixed with ¼ cup of baking soda should intensify the paint stripping power of this method., Remove the hardware from the water with tongs. Put on gloves so you can handle the hot hardware. Hold the hardware in your gloved hands and use a tool, like a putty knife, to scrape the loosened paint from the hardware.   As the hardware cools, the paint will become more difficult to scrape free. Dunk your hardware back into the hot water with your tongs to soften it again. Use a soft bristle brush to remove paint any remaining paint from the hardware. Brushes can be especially useful for removing paint from cracks and crevices.	Unfasten the hardware. Boil the hardware in water. Scrape off the paint.
Used book stores, library book sales, and thrift stores are good places to find a tome that will suit this purpose.  Look for something with an attractive cover in a color that suits your (or your recipient's) style. Some old books are bound with leather (or a lookalike) and embossed. Look around for textbooks, mismatched/outdated encyclopedias, Reader's Digest Condensed Books or anything that you think will be worth more for its cover than its contents.; , You can use scissors or a craft knife. Open the cover and cut along the gutter (crease) line.       Empty cover, ready to become a purse.  If you like, hang onto the pages or part of them for use in a collage or other paper crafts. Text, even if it's nothing in particular, can lend character to craft projects, and things like old encyclopedias can be great sources of images and inspiration. You can also cut out text to glue onto the cover of the book- the name of the person, etc.  Heavy mailing envelopes work fine., Cut slightly INSIDE your tracing lines so that you get a cardboard rectangle that is just slightly smaller than your book cover(s).,,, This will support and reinforce the bottom of your new purse.,, You may starch the fabric to make it stiffer and easier to use if you like., Lay the cardboard on the cloth and cut around it, leaving an inch or so in every direction.,,       Fold a quarter yard (23cm) of fabric into quarters (fold once along a vertical centered fold line, then once along a horizontal fold line). You should end up with a rectangular shape, with folds on two adjacent edges and four layers of material. Measure and mark the following:       One spine width from the corner where the two folded edges meet, along the edge with two folds. This measurement is shown by the red line in the previous diagram. One book cover width from the corner where the folded edges meet, down either of the longest sides. This measurement is shown by the blue line in the previous diagram. A diagonal line from the end of the first measurement to the end of the second measurement.             Blue line is the folded edge. The red line is a folded edge that should be cut to separate the triangle(s) from each other.  Cut the triangles from the markings you made.       You should now have two triangles that measure as follows: A = twice the spine width. B = the length of the short side (width) of the book cover. C = the distance that you want your book purse to open up. Repeat the process to make two more triangles with these dimensions, making for a total of four triangles.  (see photo for pointers), Right sides together.,,,, Stitch up the fold at least an inch. This will help your purse to close cleanly without the fabric bunching outward., You may glue the fabric to the front side if you wish as well., Be certain that the dart lies to the inside of the cover. Glue into place.,, Glue into place.,,,,,,,,	Obtain a largish hardcover book.  Cut the pages away from the cover.  Trace the book cover onto some firm pressed cardboard.  Cut your tracing out.  Cut the spine section away. ,  Check to see that the cardboard cutouts fit the covers of the book, and that their edges fit slightly INSIDE the edges of the book covers. ,  Cut a piece of pressed cardboard slightly smaller than the size of the book spine.Launder your fabric.  Iron the fabric smooth.  Use your cardboard rectangles as a template to cut your cloth.  Repeat for the spine cardboard piece. , Cut the ends of your purse.  Trim the top of the fabric to one quarter inch (or so) longer than the width of the cover.  Sew the long sides of each pair of triangles.   Turn and press the seam. ,Top stitch.Fold the bottom, narrow edge of your triangle in half to form a dart at the bottom. By hand or by machine, begin your stitch slightly less than halfway from fold to edge.    Cover the two large cardboard rectangles with fabric, gluing the edges to the back side.  Place the narrow, darted edge of the triangle(s) onto the inside, spine ends of the book cover.Lay one of the thin strips of cardboard on the back side of its fabric.  Wrap the short ends of the fabric over the short ends of the spine cover.  Glue the long, raw edges of the triangles to the top and bottom edges of the book cover to form the sides of your purse. ,  Make two loops of bias tape, one to hold the button/bead closure and one for the button to slide through. ,Place the bias tape loops in the center of the openings and glue them carefully to the edges.  String beads on the bias tape or similar for your handle. ,  Measure carefully and glue them into place. ,   Glue your covered rectangles to the inside of each book cover, covering all raw edges. ,  Press bottom corners to the inside of purse and glue them into place. ,  Your new purse is ready to dazzle and amaze!
To stand at ease, you can relax and stand comfortably, but do not talk or move around. Stand with your feet shoulder distance apart. Place your left hand in the small of your back. Your right hand will hold your instrument, unless you are carrying a drum, which will be held in front of you.; , Lift your left leg up and bring it down to the ground on the count of 1. At the same time, bring your left arm from behind your back and place it on your left side. Your thumb will rest on the seam of your pants. On the count of 2, bring your heels together.  Keep your heels together and your toes straight out. Straighten your legs, trying not to stiffen your knees. Rest evenly on your heels and balls of your feet. Draw your hips slightly back beneath your shoulders.  Stretch your neck out as long as possible without creating tension. Hold your chin level to the field and focus your eyes forward on a distant point in space., Hold your instrument parallel to the ground, or in uniform with the other instruments in your section. On the count of 1 extend your instrument directly out away from you. On the count of 2, grasp the instrument with your left hand. On the count of 3, bring your instrument into playing position.  Your starting position on the chart is listed in a coordinate system of horizontal and vertical values.   Instead of an X and Y coordinate, this might be listed as a number of steps Left or Right (on either side of the 50 yard line) and a number of steps in front of or behind the hash line that runs parallel to the Visitor-Home sidelines.Drill charts are read from the viewpoint of the director. If the chart says “in front of” it means toward the director. If the chart says “behind” it means away from the director’s viewpoint.  In order for the marching band to look uniform, it’s important that everybody moves about the same distance with each step they take. Drill chart instructions will be listed in steps.   The standard marching style is called 8-to-5, which means there are 8 steps for every 5 yards. Since there will be 5-yard lines on a standard football field, it creates a grid marchers can follow, counting 8 steps between each line. You can also think of each step as being an average of 22.5 inches, since there should be 8 steps in 5 yards. This measurement is often used as a standard. More important than knowing the average size of a standard step while you’re marching is to be moving at the same pace as those around you., Each position in a drill chart corresponds to a count in the music. As the song progresses, you will move across the field into a new position. You will start on the count of 0 and generally move in increments of 8., 8-to-5 is the most common marching style. Every step is 22.5 inches. In other words, you will take 8 steps between every 5 yard line. You will start with your left foot and end on your right.   Another common style is the 6-to-5 style, which means 6 (30 inch) steps per 5 yards.  Lift your leg high in the air with your thigh parallel to the ground and your calf vertical to the ground with your toes pointed. Break the step into 4 motions.   On the count of 1, lift your left heel off the ground, keeping your toes pointed. On the count of 2, lift your left leg into a chair position, keeping your toes pointed. On the count of 3, drop your left leg so the toe is pointed and the heel is off the ground. On the count of 4, drop your left heel to the ground. Repeat this for your right leg.  Keep your legs straight while you march. Start by lifting and moving your left foot forward. Plant your heel into the ground first, keeping your foot straight so that your toes point up at an angle and so the bottom of your foot can be seen. Repeat for your right foot.   A roll step, also known as a glide step, is a way to march while keeping your instrument level so that it is easier to play.  To march backwards, use the motions of the chair step. Bring each leg up into a chair position, then thrust the foot backwards. Always stay on the balls of your feet and keep your heels off the ground.  Turn 90 degrees to the left, pivoting on the ball of your right foot. To do a right flank, turn 90 degrees to the right and pivot on your left foot.  To perform a horn slide, you will only turn the upper half of your body instead of turning on the ball of your foot. Turn the upper half of your body (along with your horn) 90 degrees right or left, while keeping your legs and feet in the same position, marching in the same direction they were before, if you are marching.   For a lateral slide, do a left or right flank with the lower half of your body, but keep the upper half of your body facing the same direction as it was before.  For percussionists, the crab step will substitute for a slide. To crab step to the left, on the count of 1 sidestep with your left foot over your right, taking about ¾ of a standard sized step. Then sidestep with your right foot, take a slightly larger 1¼ sized step so that you are moving at the same pace as the horn section who is taking standard sized steps each time.  Make a sharp up-and-down motion with your head, which will cause the instrument to move up and down. This will accompany turning movements.  Make a 90 degree turn in 4 counts.  To halt, bring your feet back to the attention positing, beginning the movement with your right foot and ending on your left foot.	Stand at ease. Move to attention. Stand at attention. Hold your head up. Bring your instrument into playing position. Find your position number. Move in equal sized steps. Follow the count. March in an 8-to-5 style. March a chair step. March a rolling step. March backwards. Do a left or right flank. Do a horn slide or a lateral slide. Do a crab step. Do a horn flash. Do a slow turn. Halt.
This simple method ensures the vest will be a good fit without the hassle of measurements, etc.; , Seam allowance is the part that gets folded under when you make the seams. , For each half, fold the t-shirt in half vertically and trace around it, adding seam allowance along the outer edge plus a little extra room for the front-center overlap if desired (e.g., where you'd put snaps or buttons).  Again, add room (1/2 inch) for the seam allowance. Keep in mind the back may have a higher neckline than the front pieces, depending on your design.  Put the cutout pieces together as they would be for the vest, making sure the armholes and hem line up., You'll need at least 1 to 1 1/2 yards for the vest, and an equal amount for the lining.   The lining is the part that goes inside the vest, on the reverse side of the outer cloth. If you have doubts as to how much fabric you need, take your pattern to the fabric or craft store and ask for help. It's always better to have a bit extra material than not enough. You can choose from a wide range of materials for your vest. Keep in mind the season when selecting your fabric; for example, you can use a light wool for autumn, velvet for winter, seersucker for spring, and silk or light cotton for summer.  On a large working surface, lay the fabric out. Place the cutout patterns on top, pinning them together to avoid slippage. Use a pen to trace the outline onto the fabric.  Remove the pattern pieces and use a pen to mark a dotted line around the fabric about 1/2 inch from the edge (your seam allowance). You'll follow this line when you sew up the vest., When you've finished this, check that the lining pieces line up with the vest pieces.  At this point, you are not sewing the lining to the vest, but rather working on the two parts separately.Right sides together (RST) means that the insides of your seam – the parts touching each other – are the right sides of the cloth (the part with the pattern and/or the one that will be seen in the finished product), while the wrong sides are showing outside.At this point, it may be helpful to press the seams flat with an iron if your fabric allows.  Line up the vest and lining pieces, making sure the side seams and shoulder openings match up. Pin them together and sew along all sides except the shoulder seams (the part at the top between the neck and shoulder openings)., At this point, the right side of the fabric should be visible for both liner and vest.  First fold the top 1/2 inch of the back shoulder piece under, then tuck the front piece in. Place a pin at either end of the shoulder seam and sew together on the back piece, about 1/8 inch from the edge. Repeat for the other shoulder seam.  While for some vests this may not be desirable, it adds a crisp finish to more tailored pieces. You can make topstitch with your sewing machine.   For a subtle topstitch, use a regular or lightweight thread that is a similar shade as the fabric. For more contrast, choose a heavier thread and/or a contrasting color. Press the vest before adding topstitch for better accuracy., If you want the option of closing your vest, you'll need to decide how. Buttons and snaps are popular options and easy to add.   Measure where you want your closures to go. You can eyeball the top and bottom closures and then measure and mark precisely where the middle closures should be. Ensure you have the positions marked evenly on both inside edges so that they line up.  Follow the directions for your particular snap plier. First affix the stub to one side, and next the socket to the other.    To make button holes by hand, sew two parallel satin stitches the length of the button and connect them at the top and bottom (these are called bar tacks). Place pins at either end of the hole, just along the bar tacks, and slice open the fabric in between the seams using a seam ripper or small, sharp scissors. Alternatively, your sewing machine might have an attachment for button holes. Lucky you!Sew buttons onto the opposite side of the button holes.	Trace a tank top or a t-shirt (with sleeves tucked in so you can get the arm openings) onto pieces of newspaper or a brown paper bag that's been opened up. Add about 1/2 inch (about 13 mm) around the entire outline for seam allowance. Make the front piece in two halves. Make the back piece by laying the t-shirt flat and tracing along it. Cut out the pattern pieces and inspect. Buy your cloth. Cut out the fabric. Mark the stitching lines on the wrong side (the side you won't see in the finished product). Repeat Steps 1 and 2 for your lining cloth. Using a sewing machine, sew side seams right sides together (RST), vest to vest, lining to lining. Sew the vest and lining fabrics together RST, leaving the shoulder seams open. Turn the fabric inside-out by pulling it through one of the shoulder seams. Pin and sew shoulder seams. Add a row of topstitch 1/8 inch all the way along the edge (optional).A topstitch is a stitch visible from the fabric's right side. Decide on a closure type. Add snaps with a snap plier tool. Add buttons by making button holes and sewing buttons on the opposite side.
Although the often used term "plane spotting" refers to airplanes, the preferred term is "aircraft spotting" because you can observe and record any number of flying craft and not just airplanes. For example, helicopters, gliders, balloons, airships, and microlights can be included if wished.You might want to narrow the choices if you live somewhere that has an incredible amount of air traffic, such as London, Chicago, Frankfurt, etc., or you might want to include a wider range of aircraft if you're living in the middle of empty airspace where aircraft arrivals are not so frequent, such as the country, outback, or the Arctic region. It's really up to your time availability and personal interests.   Start by doing some background research on aircraft spotting websites. There are many sites dedicated to aircraft spotting, from the amateur blog to the professional club-sponsored site, and they can all open up new ideas for your hobby. When searching for online information about aircraft spotting, also use the term "plane spotting", as it is used frequently as well. When looking for information online, also look for airports, aircraft manufacturers, airline information, flight pathways, etc., as these will provide you with a great deal of useful background information. You can limit the search to your own country, or check different sites from all around the world.Keep in mind that aviation photography is a hobby in its own right, and dovetails perfectly with aircraft spotting. So, if anyone questions your interest, you can always justify it by explaining that you are an aviation photography hobbyist as well!; , Although you are free to spot aircraft in any way that pleases you, there are some standard practices that aircraft spotters tend to follow. In order to work out the type of aircraft, there are many indicators that assist the aircraft spotter in working this out. In addition, even where the type of plane is evident, there ares still many other elements worth noting, including country of origin, age, and any special modifications. Things to note as an aircraft spotter include:Noting the type of plane. Its make, size, colors, and country of origin can all be of interest. Noting the plane's registration details. This might enable you to discern the delivery or launch dates of the particular aircraft, depending how much detail you want to go into. Noting any interesting artwork or insignia features on a plane (for example, some airlines like Qantas paint the tail wing, or the whole aircraft, using special artwork from renowned artists on certain planes). For military aircraft, camouflage markings are important and these will differ from country to country. There might also be squadron badges and code letters. Noting engine noise, vapor trails. Placement of wings - is it a monoplane, biplane, or triplane. How are the wings placed in relation to the fuselage, and how much do they sweep rearwards? Is it a recent aircraft, or a vintage model? Noting whether it has retractable wheels or a fixed undercarriage. Or is it a seaplane? Noting the speed. Noting cockpit placement. Noting the landing or take-off pattern of the plane.  Here is your excuse to indulge in good quality gear guaranteed to enhance your aircraft spotting experience. Some items to consider include:   Decent binoculars - for checking out incoming aircraft angles, for noting registration numbers, marks and details, for outdoing your mate at seeing things first, good binoculars are a must. You can also purchase a "spotting scope" instead of binoculars, if preferred.  Digital camera, plus telescope lens, tripod, etc. - for photographic records of the aircraft you have spotted. This is especially important if you are keeping a personal digital album record of your spots, or if you're contributing your spots to a website. Fold-up chair, thermos flask, snack container, rug and warm clothing if cold, sunscreen and hat if hot, snacks and drinks - it's important to be comfortable and to keep well hydrated and fed! Manuals or guides if you want to work out what the aircraft is. You will need to consider both commercial aircraft manuals or guides and military aircraft manuals or guides unless you're not likely to see military aircraft, in which case, only commercial aircraft manuals will be needed. Ask at your local library or look online - some online auction sites can be a good source of such manuals, or sites dedicated to aircraft spotting. A dedicated notebook and decent all-weather pens for writing down the information you glean from spotting. A weatherproof notebook available from camping stores is a good idea. A safety jacket. While not essential, if you are able to spot somewhere that could potential be hazardous for you if you're not seen, consider getting a safety jacket. This might be useful even if your only hazardous element is crossing a very busy main road to get to your spotter's paradise.  It's a lot more fun if you're doing this with someone you know and who appreciates your enthusiasm for aircraft spotting too. If you have a buddy, both of you can chat and set up your own spotting competitions between you. Take walkie-talkies and sit in different locations to see who can spot the registration first. Award yourself points, with the winner or loser shouting a meal or drink after the day's spotting, depending on how you like to play it!  , Initially, it is a good idea to team up with somebody who has already done aircraft spotting so that they can take you to the best places and give you pointers throughout the session. If not, look online, or ask around, to find suitable places to go aircraft spotting. Some airports or aviation associations are very helpful and suggest spotting places for enthusiasts.Always consider safety first. Don't go where you're not allowed. There are strict rules about getting too close to airports, even if they're not fenced off. On the whole, those rules are for your own safety but they're also about security, particularly in more security conscious countries. Set up your spotting area with consideration for existing spotters. If you are somewhere used traditionally for spotting, it's probably not wise to just assume it's OK to sit just anywhere. Ask for advice from the other spotters and they'll usually be very happy to make suggestions for you.  If you've already worked out from the previous steps what you're looking for, then start observing for those elements as you're spotting. Otherwise, you might to ease yourself into the aircraft spotting experience by simply observing everything initially and deciding from this experience which elements interest you most. This is why it can be helpful to have someone already well versed in spotting nearby, to give you hints and guidance so that you don't feel overwhelmed by the initial spotting experience.  While on your outing, you will be taking notes and photos which will need sorting once back home. Plan to set aside some time to tidy up, collate and reference your findings. This might include:   Selecting the best aircraft photos for uploading to a website. Noting significant features or things of interest that you saw during the aircraft spotting exercise. Tallying up the aircraft spotted. Marking down the aircraft you've not spotted before, as well as making notes of aircraft you still would like to be able to check off in the future.  There are many possibilities and some of them may be more appealing than others. For starters, it is a good idea to consider how you feel about the following ideas as forming a part of your hobby, or not, as the case may be:   Competing with other aircraft spotters. This can include joining a club or association and aiming to spot all types of aircraft in a class that is determined by the club or association. Creating your own website and uploading your photos of spots onto it, along with commentary.  Uploading your photos of spots onto one of the many aircraft spotting websites already online. This can be a combination of competition and hobby if wished, or just serve as a source of displaying your photos as wished. If you do this, be sure to keep note of the date, time, and place of your spot, as many sites record the "last spot" of each aircraft as a way of keeping track of the aircraft for all interested viewers. Joining spotting mail lists. There are a number of these that you can join to be kept informed.There are now also Twitter accounts you can follow to keep up with spotting information.Find out if your local club or association, or your favorite aircraft spotting websites, have Twitter accounts that you can follow. Broadening your hobby to include what are "ancillary activities", such as listening to air traffic transmissions (this can be done using radio scanners but only where it is legal to do so). Packing your bags and getting on a plane to go and spot more planes somewhere else in the world. If you have spent time cultivating friendships with other aircraft spotting enthusiasts around the world, this can be a fun and exciting way to make holiday plans and to make new friends. There are plenty of sites dedicated to explaining where the best places for aircraft spotting are to be found around the world. Just be understanding that if you drag along the family though, they're unlikely to want to spend their holiday pursuing your passion, so have something more interesting planned for them! Visiting aviation museums around the world. This can also be adding to your aircraft spotting records, as you check off vintage and famous aircraft from different parts of the world.  A hobby is always a lot more fun when you share it with other like-minded enthusiasts and being part of an excited and active group is a great way to give real life to your hobby experience. For example, you can join the LAAS International as an aircraft enthusiast. , As your hobby continues, if you notice anything that you believe should be passed on to airport officials, then be helpful and do so. This doesn't mean being a nuisance and trying to suppose you know their job better than they do, but some things that could be helpful include:   Alerting airport officials if you notice any bird nesting or animal breeding activities near the airport or on it. Birds and animals can be a hazard for aircraft and it's a good idea to let airport officials know in case they haven't realized. Alerting airport officials if you notice any strange activities, or security breaches such as broken fences, etc. Don't be a vigilante though - just things that might be out of the ordinary. For example, in the UK there is a code of conduct in place for aircraft spotters introduced by aviation enthusiasts' club LAAS International, under which aircraft spotters are encouraged to report suspicious behavior.	Make a decision as to the extent of aircraft that you might like to "spot". Understand what is usually involved in aircraft spotting. Get some good gear. Take a buddy. Prepare yourself for an aircraft spotting trip. Start spotting. Record your experiences once back at home. Decide how far you want to take your new hobby. Consider joining a club or association that supports and promotes aircraft spotting. Be useful.
Arrange your tools on a clean flat surface and have all your tools at hand. Make sure you have enough space to move around as well as keeping your soldering iron at a safe distance while not in use.   Make sure you have the Dream Lite on hand, too!; , Remove all three batteries before moving forward.  Starting at the corners, pull up until you hear the top cover pop, continue to the next corner (start going long ways) and then pull up on the middle. The other side will come off with greater ease once the first side is done.   This does take a bit of muscle; don't be afraid to strong arm it, just be mindful of your fingernails. Here's what it should look like without the cover.  Using a Phillips head screwdriver, remove the two screws that are securing the board to the casing.   You will now be able to move the board around but be careful as some of the wires are short and won't allow you to twist too far.  D1 is the amber LED, D2 is the green LED, and D3 is the blue LED.   This tutorial shows replacement of the blue LED (D3). You can even change up the colors to suit your child's taste.  Place locking pliers (regular pliers will work but you will need to keep your grip) around the bulb you want to remove keeping it as close to the board as possible. You can use this to not only hold your board still but the added pressure will help pull the bulb out as you use your soldering iron to loosen it.  Using the pliers to hold the bulb and board, carefully use the soldering iron to melt the solder around the two pins for that specific LED bulb. This may take some back-and-forth moving between the pins––do not hold the iron against the board or keep it on the solder too long or you may damage the board this way. Going back and forth will help keep the heat down.   You can use small nail clippers to trim some of the solder and pin away before using the soldering iron. This can help cut down the amount of time needed to loosen the bulb; doing this is optional.    Depending on the style of LED bulb you are using, you may have to trim the pins. Trim just above the little squares using wire cutters or nail clippers. If you want to test the bulb before doing anything and have a flat 3v battery at hand, place the bulb with one pin on each side as shown in the photo. Make sure the positive pin is on the positive side. If it doesn't light, try flipping the bulb around.  Each bulb has a positive and negative pin. In order for it to work, you must make sure you are placing the new bulb on the board correctly. To find the positive and negative pin, look at the inside of the bulb. The positive pin will have the least amount of metal inside and the negative pin will have the most.  You can use them to slide the new bulb into. One of the openings will have + above it. Make sure to place the positive pin into that hole.  Using electrical tape, secure the new bulb onto the board to keep it in place while soldering.   If you make the strip of tape long enough, you can then secure the board to part of the casing. This will help keep your hands free to use the soldering iron and solder.  Using a small amount of solder, secure the pins to the board being careful to not press the iron against the board for too long. Use as little solder as possible to keep the board clean.  Replace the batteries and turn on the Dream Lite. Go through all of the settings to make sure the bulb is bright enough and dims with the rotate setting.  Screw the board back in once you have verified everything is working.  Pop the top of the casing back on. Again, this takes a bit of muscle. Start with the corners first and then the middle. Revel in your newfound skills!	Prepare. Remove the batteries. Remove the top cover. Unscrew the board. Take this time to examine which bulb you need to remove. Secure the dim/dead LED. Remove the bulb. Prepare the new bulb. Find the positive pin. Find the 2 small openings on the board. Secure the new bulb. Solder the new bulb. Test the bulb. Remove the batteries. Replace the top.
Learn it thoroughly with careful attention to establishing consistent fingerings, dynamics, articulation, and any repeats.   Once you're familiar with your piece, memorize it. Memorize measure by measure or line by line. Even after you've learned and memorized it, continue to practice diligently at slow tempos to fix any new problems that develop. Practice with the understanding that you won't be able to make changes at the last minute, and your performance will sound much like your practice.; , If your piano is at home, play for your family and guests. Find pianos in public places and play your piece for passersby.   If you practice in a music school, play for other students. Evaluate each performance for its good and bad moments, and develop a plan for fixing the mistakes.  Pick out the clothes you'll be wearing and make sure they don't restrict your movement or look awkward when you play. Knowing you look great gives you one less thing to worry about on the day of the recital.  On the day of the recital, play your piece slowly with the music. Pay attention to troublesome spots, but understand that it's too late to make major changes. Once you've looked over your piece, play something that you love to play, gets you excited about sharing your music with others, or relaxes you.  If possible, test out the instrument you'll be performing on. Evaluate its soft and loud dynamics, tonal control, relative loudness of the octaves, and pedals. You should arrive early even if you're not able to play on the performance instrument: few things contribute to performance anxiety like arriving to your recital late.  Be confident in your thorough preparation. The green room is no place to change fingerings or correct memory slips, so reassure yourself that you have it down. If you feel the need, review the score and play the piece in your head, but not more than once.  As you do, smile at the audience and think to yourself, "I have prepared my piece and I feel confident!" Roll the bench up or down to the proper height for you, and take your time to get it right. Once you're done, put your hands in your lap and vividly imagine the beginning of your piece, paying attention to tempo, tone, volume, and the sensation of playing the first notes.  Immerse yourself in the music. Enjoy the audience's captivation. Revel in sharing your hard work.	Prepare your piece. Perform your piece in low-pressure settings. Do a dress rehearsal. Warm up. Arrive early. Stay calm backstage. Step onto the stage confidently. Forget about everything.
You do not want the car to roll or sink once you have it jacked up.  It is important to remember to loosen, or break, the lug nuts before you jack up the vehicle. This way the weight of the vehicle is still on the wheels and it prevents them from spinning dangerously while you turn the lugs.  Once the lugs have been loosened, it will be necessary to jack the care up so that the wheels can be removed. As mentioned above, this should be done on level concrete or some other hard, level surface. Some important things to remember when jacking up the care are:   Your service manual will recommend jacking points The most common way to elevate the car is a floor jack, or trolley jack. If you are unsure how to use one visit Lift a Car Using a Trolley Jack. You should use jack stands to stabilize the car. A good tutorial on jack stands can be found at Use Jack Stands. If you have access to a hydraulic lift it will save you time.  At this point, the lugs may be loose enough to remove by hand. If not, finish removing the lugs with the lug wrench or impact wrench. Once the lugs are removed, pull the wheel off of the wheelbase. If you are uncomfortable removing a wheel, read about how to Remove Lug Nuts and Tires.  You can use a small kiddie pool, bathtub, or any other container large enough to hold the tire. You should add water until the tire is completely submerged and then allow the water to settle.  Once the water has settled you might notice air bubbles escaping from the tire. If so, you have found your leak.	Pull the car onto level, solid ground. Loosen the lug nuts with a lug wrench (tire iron) or impact wrench. Jack up the car. Remove the wheel. Submerge the tire in water. Watch for air bubbles.
; , It should reach about 1 inch (2.5cm) in height.  Shorten the stems of the leaves if they're longer than 1 1/2 inches (3.27cm). , Do this very slowly and with care not to cause folds in the leaves. There should be enough silica gel to cover the leaves.  Add the container of leaves and silica.  Initially microwave for 1 minute, then check and try another minute. You are looking for the leaves to have dried, which will take about 2-3 minutes.  Pour the silica gel into another container, slowly and carefully. Any silica still on the leaves can be brushed off with your fingers or a paintbrush or other suitable small soft brush.  This step is optional but it will help prolong the life of the preserved leaves by strengthening them. Follow the instructions on the packaging.  You can include the silica-preserved leaves in floral arrangements, artwork, craft projects, and as decoration on wrapping, cards, and pictures, etc.	Place the microwave-safe container on a flat work surface, such as the kitchen table. Pour the silica gel into the container so that it covers the base of the container. Prepare the leaves. Arrange the leaves across the surface of the silica in the container.  , Pour in more silica gel over the top of the leaves sitting on the other silica gel. Put the glass of water into the microwave. Microwave the container on medium power. Remove the container from the microwave. Spray glaze or dried flower coating over the leaves. Use the leaves.
It is usually a light colored reservoir with a black cap and is usually is inline with your brake pedal in the engine compartment.; , Using a clean turkey baster, suck out as much of the old, inky fluid as you can.  After you've gotten all the old brake fluid out, clean any sediment out of the reservoir, if accessible, with a clean, lint-free rag. Do not spill any brake fluid on any painted surfaces, it will remove the paint almost immediately. Clean up any spilled fluid with a brake clean fluid or soap and water.  Replace the top of the master cylinder reservoir. , Using a box-end wrench (often 5/16") that fits the bleeder bolt, loosen the bleeder valves, but leave them closed. A little oil drizzled or sprayed on the bolts the day before will help to loosen them.  Using a piece of clear plastic tubing (aquarium tubing works fine), push one end of the tube over the brake bleeder bolt.   Put the other end of the tube into a small, clear bottle with an inch or two of clean brake fluid in it. (This will keep air from being sucked back into the brake cylinder or lines.)  , This will prevent the pedal from traveling too close to the floor and you begin to bleed the brakes. This is needed so you do not bottom out pistons in the master cylinder and causing internal master cylinder leakage.  Remove the top of the master cylinder reservoir and top off the master cylinder reservoir with fresh fluid. Keep the master cylinder full during process otherwise air might get into system. , The helper should shout "down" when the pedal is down as far as it will go.    Note: Not too much force is needed. Press down as much as you would to fully come to a halt before a stop sign.  Old fluid and air will go down the tubing into the bottle. When the fluid stops, close the bleeder valve.    Note: Warn your helper that the brake pedal he or she is pressing down on will sink down as you unlock the bleeder bolt a quarter turn. This is perfectly natural and your helper should keep pressure and follow pedal down until it stops and hold it down. , After every five times the brake pedal is depressed, top off the master cylinder reservoir with fresh fluid. Never let the reservoir get too low, or air will be sucked into the master cylinder. ,,,, Your brakes have been properly bled. Thank your helper by buying him or her a beer or cream soda. Never take your help for granted.	Remove the top of the master cylinder reservoir. Draw out the old fluid. Clean the reservoir. Fill the master cylinder with clean brake fluid. Pump the brake pedal several times (15 or more).  , Loosen the bleeder valves. Hook a tube to the bleeder bolt. Put a piece of 1 x 4 lumber or some other "spacer" under the brake pedal. Refill the master cylinder reservoir. Replace the top of the master cylinder reservoir.  , Have a helper sit in the driver's seat and slowly depress the brake pedal with an even force and hold it down. Starting with the rear passenger wheel (back right for left-hand drive cars), turn the bleeder bolt to the left one quarter-turn. Shout "up" to your helper, who at this point should remove his or her foot from the pedal, allowing it to move up.  , Repeat this process until new, clear fluid comes from the bleeder tube. Tighten the bleeder bolt back up.  , Repeat steps 12 to 15 on the left rear wheel.  , Repeat steps 12 to 15 on the right front wheel.  , Repeat steps 12 to 15 on the left front wheel.  , Finished.Never use brake fluid not fit for a specific car
Use a tape measure to measure the wrist of the future owner. After making your measurements add two or three inches to the measurements. The extra amount is for adjustments and leeway for braiding., Measure out the tape based off the lengths you took down. Cut out three strips of duct tape that are equal lengths. You can use different colors that complement each other for a flashy accessory., Fold each strip of duct tape lengthwise. Fold the adhesive into itself so that there isn’t any sticky side of the tape leftover. Attach each folded strip together using tape or a binder clip at one end of the tape., Start by laying each strip side by side. Wrap the leftmost strip over the rest of the strips. Wrap the rightmost strip up and over the left strip. Now wrap the center strip over the rightmost strip. Wrap the leftmost strip around the center. Continue this pattern until you reach the end of the bracelet., Finish up the bracelet by taping or stapling the other end of the braid. Wrap the bracelet around the wearer’s wrist and then tape the two ends together. Ensure that the bracelet is not too tight.	Create the measurements. Cut your duct tape. Fold and connect your strips. Braid the strips. Secure the braid.
This is a contract between a seller and a buyer. The seller agrees to sell a commodity in the future at a price upon which they agree today. The seller agrees to deliver this asset in the future, and the buyer agrees to purchase the asset in the future. No physical exchange takes place until the specified future date. This contract must be accounted for now, when it is signed, and again on the date when the physical exchange takes place.For example, suppose a seller agrees to sell grain to a buyer in 3 months for $12,000, but the current value of the grain is only $10,000. In one year, when the exchange takes place, the market value of the grain is $11,000, so in the end, the seller makes a profit of $1,000 on the sale. The spot rate, or current value, of the grain is $10,000. The forward rate, or future value, of the grain is $12,000.; , On the liability side of the equation, you would credit the Asset Obligation for the spot rate. Then, on the asset side of the equation, you would debit the Asset Receivable for the forward rate. Finally, debit or credit the Contra-Asset Account for the difference between the spot rate and the forward rate. You would debit, or decrease the Contra- Asset Account for a discount and credit, or increase it for a premium.Using the example above, the seller would credit the Asset Obligation account for $10,000. He has made a commitment to sell his grain today, and today it is worth $10,000. But, he is going to receive $12,000 for the grain. So he debits Assets Receivable for $12,000. This is what he’s going to be paid. To account for the $2,000 premium, he credits the Contra-Asset Account for $2,000.  On the liability side of the equation, you would credit Contracts Payable in the amount of the forward rate. Then you would record the difference between the spot rate and the forward rate as a debit or credit to the Contra-Assets Account. On the asset side of the equation, you would debit Assets Receivable for the spot rate.Using the example above, the buyer would credit Contracts Payable in the amount of $12,000. Then he would debit the Contra-Assets Account for $2,000 to account for the difference between the spot rate and the forward rate. Then he would debit Assets Receivable for $10,000.  First, you close out your asset and liability accounts. On the liability side, debit Asset Obligations by the spot value on the contract date. On the asset side, credit Contracts Receivable by the forward rate, and debit or credit the Contra-Assets account by the difference between the spot rate and the forward rate.Using the above example, on the liability side you would debit Asset Obligations by $10,000. On the asset side, you would credit Contracts Receivable by $12,000/ Then you would debit the Contra-Asset account by $2,000, the difference between the spot rate and the forward rate.  Determine the current market value of the commodity. This is its value on the date of the physical exchange between the buyer and seller. Next, debit, or increase, your cash account by the forward rate. Then credit, or decrease, your Asset account by the current market value of the commodity. Finally, recognize the gain or loss, which is the difference between the forward rate and the current market value, with a debit or credit on the Asset Account.In the example above the current market value of the grain on the date of the physical exchange is $11,000. First, the seller must increase cash based on the contracted amount, so he would debit cash by $12,000. Next he must reduce the Asset account by the current market value by recording a credit of $11,000. Then, to recognize the gain of $1,000 (which is the current value, $11,000, less the spot rate, $10,000), he would record a credit on the Asset Account of $1,000.  First, you close out your asset and liability accounts. On the liability side, debit Contracts Payable by the forward rate, and debit or credit the Contra-Assets account by the difference between the spot rate and the forward rate. On the asset side, credit Assets Receivable by the spot rate on the date of the contract.Using the example above, on the liability side, the buyer would debit Contracts Payable by $12,000 and credit the Contra-Asset Account by $2,000. On the asset side, he would credit Assets Receivable by $10,000.  Decrease, or credit the Cash account by the amount of the forward rate. Then, record the difference between the forward rate and the current market value as an additional credit or debit to the Cash account. Finally, increase, or debit, the Asset account by the current market value of the commodity.In the above example, the buyer would debit Cash by $12,000. The difference between the market value, $11,000, and the forward rate $12,000, is $1,000. They buyer lost $1,000, so he would record a debit to Cash of $1,000. Next, he would debit the Asset account by $11,000.  A forward contract is an agreement between a buyer and a seller to deliver a commodity on a future date for a specified price. The value of the commodity on that future date is calculated using rational assumptions about rates of exchange. Farmers use forward contracts to eliminate risk for falling grain prices.Forward contracts are also used in transactions using foreign exchange in an effort to reduce the risk of losses due to changes in the exchange rates., A derivative is a security with a price that is based upon, or derived, from something else. Forward contracts are considered derivative financial instruments because the future value of the commodity is derived from other information about the commodity.The future value of the commodity for the forward contract is derived from the current market value, or spot price, and the risk-free rate of return.  In investing, hedging means minimizing risk. In forward contracts, buyers and sellers attempt to minimize risk of losses by locking in prices for commodities in advance. Buyers lock in a price in hopes that they will end up paying less than the current market value of a commodity. Sellers hedge their risks with forward contracts in an attempt to protect themselves from falling prices., The party agreeing to purchase the commodity assumes the long position. The party agreeing to sell the commodity is assuming the short position.The buyer, who is in the long position, is the person who stands to benefit if the price of the commodity rises higher than expected. The seller, who is in the short position, stands to lose if the price of the commodity rises.  The spot value and the forward value are both quotes for the rate at which the commodity will be bought or sold. The difference between the two has to do with the timing of the settlement and delivery of the commodity. Both parties in a forward contract need to know both values in order to accurately account for the forward contract.]   The spot rate is the current market value for the asset in question. It is the value of the commodity if it were sold today. For example, a farmer selling grain for the spot value agrees to sell it immediately for the current price.The forward rate is the agreed-upon future price in the contract. For example, suppose the farmer in the above example wants to enter into a forward contract in an effort to hedge against falling grain prices. He can agree to sell his grain to another party in six months at agreed-upon forward rate. When the time comes to sell, the grain will be sold for the agreed-upon forward rate, despite fluctuations that occur in the spot rate during the intervening six months., The spot rate can be used to determine the forward rate. This is because a commodity’s future value is based in part on its current value. The other factor that is used to determine the forward value is the risk-free rate.The risk-free rate is the rate at which the commodity is expected to change in value with zero risk. It is usually based on the current interest rate of a three-month U.S. Treasury bill, which is considered the safest investment you can make.	Recognize a forward contract. Record a forward contract on the contract date on the balance sheet from the seller’s perspective. Record a forward contract on the contract date on the balance sheet from the buyer’s perspective. Record a forward contract on the balance sheet from the seller’s perspective on the date the commodity is exchanged. Recognize any gain or loss on the commodity sold from the seller’s perspective. Record a forward contract on the balance sheet from the buyer’s perspective on the date the commodity is exchanged. Recognize any gain or loss on the commodity sold from the buyer’s perspective. Understand the definition of a forward contract. Learn the meaning of derivatives. Learn the meaning of hedging. Know the difference between the long position and the short position. Know the difference between the spot value and the forward value. Understand the relationship between the spot value and the forward value.
A wet/dry vacuum such as a Shop-Vac is a powerful and handy machine that can handle different types of vacuuming jobs. They usually have a long hose or nozzle and a long cord, which makes it easier to vacuum out a car.   Alternately, use a coin-operated vacuum at car wash. These also have long nozzles, but they require that you feed coins into a timed meter, which can interrupt your cleaning progress. There are small handheld, portable vacuums that you can also use. These are usually good for spot cleaning but do not tend to have enough suction power to adequately vacuum out a car.  Most vacuums have plastic attachments, which are superior to metal attachments. With metal, you run the risk of scratching your car or upholstery, particularly if you have leather or vinyl seats.Useful attachments are brushes with a wide square opening and a skinny, narrow attachment that can reach into crevices.  When vacuuming a vehicle, make sure you are getting into all the crevices and cracks to suck up dirt and dust. Recline the seats to get at the inside crease of the seat. Move the seats forward to get underneath the seats.   Take out child car seats as well, so that you are sure to get underneath these, which tend to gather cereal, granola bars and crayons.  Vacuum the upholstery on the floor by getting underneath the floor mats. This will also make it easier to deep-clean the floor mats.  Removing dirt and debris from your car will prevent them from becoming ground into the seats and the carpet, thereby contributing to hard-to-remove stains. Set a schedule for yourself to vacuum out your car at least once a month, or more frequently if your car gets dirty quickly.	Use a wet/dry vacuum. Use plastic vacuum attachments. Move the seats. Take out floor mats. Vacuum frequently.
Contact the corporate headquarters of your local theaters. Some viewers are allowed free movies in exchange for rating the quality of service, choice of movies, customer service, and, in some cases even the quality and selection of the snacks.  Once you are on the inside, sit back and enjoy (after your shift is over, of course)! This is probably your best option for being able to see free movies on a regular basis. Just be aware that you are at work, not vacation, and keep that popcorn flowing.  This takes a bit of skill and training, and a bit of luck. But writing for a small paper or website will get you a seat for almost every movie that comes to town.   Be aware that jobs in this area are often very competitive, and even in small communities you will need to have a degree in journalism or communications before most papers will even consider you. Contrary to popular opinion, becoming a paid critic is difficult work. If you're having trouble breaking into the traditional media outlets, try starting your own movie blog, and start reviewing movies on your own. You'll have to pay at first, but if you provide quality content and earn a lot of followers, you may have some leverage in getting into more and more movies for free.	Call theater management. Get a job at a movie theater. Become a film critic.
This knight does not carry the GBE or KBE appendage. This title is for men only, and is appended John Jones, kt. This is known as the Knights Bachelor and is the most junior of the order for men. It is the lowest rank of the knighted male. A woman given this honor will actually carry the Dame Jane Jones, DBE title, Dame Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire, because this is the most junior of the order for women., For religious organizations such as the Knights of Columbus, they even say "serve the Lord, get a sword" (and then they offer you pretty epic insurance.) Besides the KofC, there are a surpringly large number of organizations that feature “Knight” in their names or as a title that can be earned by rising through the organization’s ranks.  It’s possible to gain the title of “knight” simply by paying a membership fee in some organizations or signing up for a reward program that includes the title “knight.”  , Some social organizations, such as the International Fellowship of Chivalry-Now, devote themselves to fostering the ideals of chivalrous behavior in their daily lives, as opposed to having their members to dress in armor and swing maces at each other.	Earn the title through life achievement. Join a religious or civic organization. Buy the title. Join an organization that promotes the ideals of chivalry in the modern world.
Usually the tension will be written in a box on the pattern.; , This ensures that the item will be of the correct size and appearance, rather than sloppy, lopsided, or misshapen. This will also prevent kitten-sized sweaters or refrigerator-size socks!  , This will show any problems before it is too late. For example, if the tension square is smaller than the one specified, then your needles are too small and you must find thicker needles. Equally, if your tension square is larger than the one specified, your needles are too large and you will need to replace with thinner ones.	Note that every pattern has the specific tension instructions. Always work to the correct tension specified. Always knit a tension square for practice before starting your project.
Most animals that are sneaking into your garden are doing so because they can smell the vegetables and are attracted by the free meal. Scents can also be used to keep animals out, sending a message that your garden is either not a safe place to eat or by making it smell unappealing. Take a look at the two main types of scent deterrents to help you pick one for your garden:You can buy animal repellents that smell like the urine of a predator. These repellents will make your garden seem dangerous to animals. You'll likely need to know which type of animal is invading your garden before buying a predator scent that scares that specific animal. You might try using spicy or unappealing sprays around your garden. These sprays can make animals uncomfortable or make your garden taste and smell bad enough that they will look for food elsewhere. Animal repelling sprays can be bought at most home or garden stores. You can try looking up homemade animal repellent recipes and make your own. Many sprays will need to be applied often, as rain or moisture will wash them away.  If you know the type of animal that is regularly invading your garden, you can try growing some plants that they would find repulsive. Adding plants that common garden pests dislike can help keep them out and protect your vegetables. Take a look at some of the following plants that are thought to keep away garden pests:Azalea, boxwood, lamb's ear, peony and marigolds are all unappealing to rabbits. Bleeding hearts, daffodils, hyssop, and mullein are plants that can repel deer. You can try mixing some of these plants in with your garden to make the whole thing look unappealing. Planting these barrier plants along the parameter of your garden can help repel pests.  Even though your garden is a peaceful place, the animals that are sneaking in will still be on the look out for threats. Because of this, you can add devices to your garden that are designed to startle and scare off whatever animal might be nibbling your vegetables. Take a look at some of these ideas to give you an idea of how you can make your garden a scary place to unwanted animals:Modern scarecrows come equipped with motion sensors and will spray water at any invading wildlife. Having an outdoor dog can help keep many animals out of your garden. Some repellents make use of shiny or reflective material to frighten off birds. You can buy electronic repellents that sound an alarm or play a frightening sound when they detect motion.  Cats are naturally inclined to hunt and can do a great job of keeping small animals out of your garden. Besides actually hunting the animals that make it into your garden, your cat's scent and presence may scare off future pests. So if you have an outdoor cat, consider introducing them to your garden to help cut down on the amount animals snack on your vegetables.Make sure your cat has all of its vaccines as many wild animals can carry diseases. Always monitor your cat to make sure they are in good health and are capable of safely going outdoors.  It might seem counterintuitive, but adding plants near your garden that animals love can be a good way to keep them out of your actual garden. Once you know which animals are causing you trouble, you can try planting their favorite foods away from your garden, keeping them out and sparing your vegetables.   Make sure any attractive plants are placed away from your garden. Making an animal's favorite foods easy to get to will prevent them from trying to gain access to your garden. Try planting some extra vegetables in an area that is easy for pests to get at, keeping them away from the ones you plan on eating.  Certain environments and landscapes will make animals feel more or less comfortable. Depending on how you've landscaped your garden or yard, you may actually be making animals feel right at home. Rearranging your landscaping can be a simple way to help make animals uncomfortable and keep them out of your garden. Try keeping some of these tips in mind when landscaping your garden to help scare off would be invaders: Avoid having lots of weeds or heavy plant cover, as most animals enjoy feeling hidden in the foliage. Get rid of woodpiles that may be near the garden. Cut down or move bushes or shrubs that surround the garden.	Apply sprays around your garden. Include plants that animals find repulsive in your garden. Scare away unwanted animals. Let your cat help keep small animals away. Include sacrificial plants near your garden. Use landscaping to make animals feel unwelcome.
If you don't have a serger, you have a few other options. These include:          Hand-finishing the edges with a blanket stitch or whip stitch. Finishing the edges with a decorative sewing machine stitch. Crocheting around the edge of the blanket as suggested by the Linus Project. Use a skip-stitch blade on a rotary cutter to create evenly spaced holes around the blanket's edge. Place a crochet hook through each hole, in turn. Draw the yarn through the hole toward you, perform a single crochet and chain one. Repeat.	Finish the edge of your fleece blanket with a serger.
Drum corps are relatively exclusive when it comes to instrumentation- no woodwinds of any sort are allowed to march, including all variety of saxophone. In the brass family, the DCI and DCA (more on them later) both have rules only allowing bell-front valved brass instruments into drum corps. That means trombonists, French horn players, and Sousaphone players will want to learn trumpet, mellophone, baritone/euphonium, or contrabass/tuba. Percussion instruments offered generally shift from corps to corps, depending on their style or show each year.; , Drum corps is a world with a different vocabulary than that of the rest of the world. Some of the more commonly used terms are listed here.   DCI is short for Drum Corps International, which is in charge of junior drum corps. Junior drum corps are drum corps that allow members between the ages of 13 to 21, though they may be more exclusive if they chose. DCA stands for Drum Corps Associates, and is in charge of all-age drum and bugle corps. While not as popular as DCI drum corps, all-age corps are starting to be more popular. "Phantom" style is a reference to The Phantom Regiment's marching style, which is unique. You may hear any other corps name inserted, though, as nearly all corps have their own unique style. Spirit, for example, has a "rolling walk" style, while Cavaliers have a "high walk" of sort, and Phantom has a "sharp" style. World class/open class/international class are the different classes of drum corps as of 2008. World class corps have exactly 150 members, while open class corps has 30-150 members. International class is the class for corps based in countries outside of North America that wish to tour the DCI circuit. "Contra" normally refers to the contra-bass, which is the tuba of drum and bugle corps. They look rather like very large baritones, slung over one shoulder, as seen in this picture.  Since practice schedules are often extremely difficult to follow, but time commitment is a huge part of making a corps, when looking into joining a corps, look at the local ones first. You may be surprised what isn't that far away- in 2008, there were 24 different drum corps in the World Class of DCI alone, almost all from different states.  Currently, in DCI, at least, there are no corps that are female-only, however, the Cavaliers and the Madison Scouts are male-only corps. In other countries, female-only corps are, while not common, existent, at least.  In today's global economy, fees may be the deciding factor between you marching in a corps, and you just watching the show from the stands. If you have financial problems, but are talented, some corps offers scholarships to help with dues. After you've marched a year or two of corps, though, it's much easier to get money for marching.  Regardless of what corps you decide on, when the audition weekend is, how your marching, playing, or attitude is, if you're even considering getting into corps, you must be in shape. You're not looking to build that much muscle mass, though, so standard workouts may not be exactly what you need. You should be looking to be lightweight, true, but quick and nimble. Running, biking, and swimming all help out with this without weighing you down with extra muscle mass. Push-ups and crunches are also recommended, as they will help you build the endurance you will need to survive drum and bugle corps.  Drum corps schedules are demanding, to say the least, and there is very little room for error when first going out for a corps. People understand, though, that everyone has lives outside of drum corps. As long as you are upfront and clear about any conflicts in your schedule, and they don't conflict too often, of course, you can normally have a bit of "wiggle room", though that really depends on the corps most of all.  Also, look into what else the audition exactly entails. A standard audition for drum corps includes prepared pieces of some sort, a piece of your own, sight reading, basic marching skills, and a section in which you have to march and play at the same time. It's obviously best to practice as many of these things as possible, especially if you are particularly weak in any of these areas. Range, lip setting, dynamic ability, posture, and tone are all major factors for brass players. Keep in mind, meanwhile, that many drum corps also judge attitude! Be positive, polite, and don't make excuses for yourself.  Each corp, as previously mentioned, has their own style. You don't have to know this prior to auditioning, as the instructors will teach it later, but it can't hurt to be one step ahead.  Make sure that, a week or two prior, you registered for the audition, if that was required, and paid any audition fees. Instrumentalists should bring their instrument to the first camp (normally corps-owned instruments aren't distributed until at least the second weekend), a folding music stand, their music, and any oils, tuners, metronomes, etc. that may be needed for the weekend.  At this point, there's nothing that should be said. If you have practiced enough, have the talent and ability, and just a bit of luck, you should do just fine. If not, there's always next year!	Make sure your instrument is allowed in a drum corps. Learn the terminology. Look into (relatively) local corps first. Notice gender-specific corps. Look into dues once you've found a corps you're interested in. Get into shape. Check your calendar. Find the audition music/routine. Look into the corps marching style. Show up on the audition weekend, prepared. Audition.
You'll need to draw a system of squares that will end up "inscribing" the spiral, acting as guide lines for your drawing. Gather your materials, making sure that you have everything––the list of what is needed is found in the Things You'll Need section below all the steps.; , This works by adding the two previous numbers: You get the next one starting from 0 and 1; so, it goes 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, etc. The length of one side of each square should equal a number in the sequence (the 0 is not needed for drawing any of the square), but the beginning point can be called (0,0), if we set it up that way. You will have a 1X1 square (use any unit of measurement you want, at any size, just be consistent) with a second 1X1 drawn next to it on the left side of the first, then down to put 2X2, and right for 3X3, then up for 5X5, and then left to fit 8X8. Below all that, put 13X13 and so on, to as large a square as your paper can fit.  Draw each of these squares in a counter-clockwise pattern. It will finally form a spiral as you draw a curve through the squares (as instructed later).  Put your compass, pivot point and pencil, as shown in the picture, with its length set at one unit (side of the first square) long. Turn it 90 degrees counter-clockwise.  Adjust the compass so it is now two units long. Again, turn it 90 degrees counter-clockwise. Then 3, then 5, next 8 and continue this process until the squares each have the curving spiral through them.  Ink your drawing with pen when you are ready, carefully tracing along the penciled curve. If you're shooting for exceptional accuracy, you can use a French curve to help you.  With the spiral traced in pen, use your eraser to rub out the squares made in pencil.  Congratulations, you've just made the golden spiral!	Gather your materials. Draw squares using the Fibonacci sequence. Arrange the squares. Turn the compass. Adjust the compass. Ink your spiral. Erase your guide lines. Done!
Duct tape is available in all sorts of colors and patterns, so choose some pretty, brightly colored ones to make your bow with. A good idea is to pick one color for the main part of your bow and another, contrasting color for the centerpiece.; , Use a pair of sharp scissors to do this. The six inch pieces will make a pretty large bow, so if you'd prefer a smaller one, cut out two 3 inch (7.6 cm) pieces instead.  Do this slowly and carefully to make sure the two pieces are exactly aligned. However, if you make a mistake, you can use your scissors to trim any extra bits off the edges. Try to make sure that there aren't any wrinkles and the bow will look better at the end!   At this point, you can feel free to decorate your strip of duct tape with any additional details, using markers or glitter pens.  Fold the strip of duct tape three ways, going in opposite directions each time, as if you were making a fan.  Pinch the middle of the folded duct tape between your fingers and wrap a thin strip (about 0.25 inches in width) of the other colored duct tape around the center, to secure. Make sure to keep your fingers out of the way or making a duct tape bow could turn into a sticky situation!  , Once you have made the bow, you can stick it to whatever you like. One easy idea is to stick a bobby pin through the back of the wrapped piece of tape. Now you have a beautiful, customized bow to wear whenever you want! Alternatively, you could try attaching the bow to a headband or pinning it to a schoolbag or handbag.	Get some colored duct tape. Cut two 6 inch (15.2 cm) strips of duct tape. Line up the two pieces of tape and stick the sticky sides to each other. Fold the strip three ways. Tape the center of the bow. Attach the bow to something. Finished.
If you're a serious guitar player you'll be changing your strings frequently, and some musicians change weekly. If your strings feel slow and sticky, or you have to re-tune frequently, you're due for new strings. If you haven't restrung in 3-4 months, get new strings.          If you're about to play a big gig, change the strings that morning to prevent unexpected breaking.; , If you're new to tuning, you want to have a good sense of how the guitar should look. Take a picture of the strings, or simply look up a picture of your guitar online. While it isn't complicated, you want a good sense of how the guitar is strung before beginning.         Though it is rare, some guitars have special holes or winding patterns near the strings. Don't cut the strings off without take a quick look at everything.  Turn the tuning machine or peg to loosen each string enough that you can unwind the string and pull it out but hand. You'll know you're loosening if, when plucked, the string sounds deeper. While you can also cut your strings off, this method eases tension gradually and, in the worst case scenario, you can reuse an old string if one breaks while restringing.          If you're a beginner, just loosen one string at a time. Then replace it and repeat with the next string. Once loose, you can unwind the string off the tuning peg and free it from the neck of the guitar., On a regular bridge, like a Fender Strat or any other string-through guitar, just pull the strings out of the back of the guitar's body. To make it easier, carefully push the strings through, providing some slack and making them easier to grip. Grab the string by the small, donut-shaped metal end and slowly pull it through the guitar.          Most guitars are strung in a simple, straightforward manner, so just follow the string through the guitar to remove it. Do not yank the strings out. Protect your guitar by taking your time. If you have a wrap-around bridge, you will be able to pull them out of the underside of the bridge. Wrap-arounds started out as Toms when players like ZZ Top wrapped the strings around the tailpiece to give the string height a low profile without any buzz., Use this time to remove all of the dust, grime, and dirt from the neck of your guitar. This will make the guitar look good, protect the new strings, and actually make your guitar feel a little faster. For deeper cleaning, purchase a bottle of fret-cleaner from your local music shop.  95% of the time you should get the "regular weight," or "lite" strings. While some guitarists use heavier gauges or odd string configurations, you can't simply grab a set of strings if your guitar is not made for it. Strings that are too heavy for your guitar can warp or bend the neck without the proper adjustments, so stick to regulars until you know more about your guitar.          In general, you want your high E to be a ".008-.0011" thickness. This is for medium, lite, and extra lite strings. If you use drop tunings, like a drop D, you might want heavier strings. Ask your music store staff for a specific recommendation., Give yourself plenty of room to work, laying the guitar down on a table so that you can adjust it comfortably. Make sure to place a towel or blanket underneath to prevent scuffing or scratching. Some people like resting the head off the edge to make tuning easier.  This hole should point away from the string so that it is parallel to one of the frets. If you were holding the guitar and playing it, the hole would be pointing up.  Thread it from the inside of the guitar out. In general, most guitarists will begin with their heaviest string, the top E. It will often me marked as "6th string," or by the highest gauge number (usually around .050). Slide it in the opposite way you took the other strings out, then run it through the hole in the tuning peg, pulling the string away from the guitar. Make sure you leave 2-3 inches of slack, as well -- you don't want the string to be taut before you even start tightening.          The tuning pegs aren't marked, but you should just replace the strings in the same order you took them out. On most electric guitars, the first peg is for the top string, then each one further towards the tip of the head is for a string further down., Try not to overthink this. Simply grab both sides tightly, then turn your hands clockwise to crimp both sides of the string along the tuning post. If you pulled the string out, it would look like the "S" in the Van Halen logo.          Your right hand will be coming towards your body, away from the guitar. Your left hand will be pushing up, in towards the other tuning pegs.  Take the end of the string and pull it under the other side of the string (the side being fed into the tuning post). After you go underneath the string, bring the end back over the top and pull it taut, pulling towards the very tip of the guitar. You're basically creating a loop with the end of the string around the rest of the string.          You'll have a small coiled bit of string right where the string meets the tuning peg.  Place your index finger on the string 1-2" before it meets the tuning peg. You don't want to pin it, just hold it down. Then you can turn your tuner slowly counter-clockwise. Make sure that your string is winding around the peg in a uniform manner.          Use a tuner to slowly get yourself up to the proper tension. When in doubt, try not to over-tighten -- this causes strings to break.  Once you've got the first one done, repeat the process on the rest of the strings, working through the packet. Remember to clean the fretboard after removing a string, to leave some slack in the string before tightening, and to crimp the string in place before starting to turn.          If your head has a 3x3 set-up, remember that the lower set of tuning pegs must be turned in reverse. Simply repeat the proceeding instructions, replacing left with right and up with down.  Use wire cutters to remove the excess string at the end, though you may want to leave 1/2" or so to allow deeper tunings, if you desire.  As the strings get used to the tension, they slowly stretch. This only occurs for the first 1-2 days, and can be avoided by regular, constant tuning as you put the strings on.	Change your strings when they are rusty, gummy, or falling out of tune quickly. Note the path of each string before removing it. Loosen the old strings by down-tuning. Remove the strings from the bridge. Clean your unstrung guitar with a lint-free cloth. Purchase the correct strings for your guitar. Lay the guitar on a flat, soft surface at a comfortable height. Turn the hole of the tuning post so that the hole faces you. Thread your first string through the bridge and into the tuning peg. Grab the string on both sides of the peg and crimp it in an "s" shape. Wrap the end of the string around the other half to lock the string in place. Lightly hold down the string as you slowly tighten it. Repeat the process on the rest of the strings. Cut the ends of the string off. Tune your guitar frequently once the new strings are on.
Work a starting chain of 13 chain stitches.          You'll need to start your work by tying a slipknot onto the hook. If you do not know how to do this, see the "Tips" section for more detail. You can also check the "Tips" section for instructions on working a chain stitch.  Skip the first stitch of your previous row, then work one single crochet into each of the remaining stitches until you reach the end of the row.          When finished, this row should have 12 stitches. Check the “Tips” section for more information about working single crochets.  Work one single crochet decrease across the next two stitches of the previous row. Single crochet once in each of the next eight stitches, then work another one single crochet decrease into the final two stitches of the row.          When finished, you should have 10 stitches in this row. If you do not know how to work a single crochet decrease, check the “Tips” section for instructions.  For the next row, simply work one single crochet into each stitch of the previous row.          This row should have a total of 10 stitches.  Work one single crochet decrease into the first two stitches of the third row. Single crochet once into each of the next six stitches, then work another one single crochet decrease into the last two stitches of the row.          There should be eight stitches in this row when you finish it.  Work one single crochet into each stitch of the fourth row to complete the fifth row.          This row should also have 8 stitches, just like the previous row had.  Continue working rows with two single crochet decreases in them, separated by rows of nothing but single crochets. Repeat this for another seven rows, until you reach the twelve row.          Row six should have six stitches (one single crochet decrease, four single crochets, and one single crochet decrease). Row seven should have six stitches (six single crochets). Row eight should have four stitches (one single crochet decrease, two single crochets, and one single crochet decrease Row nine should have four stitches (four single crochets). Row ten should have two stitches (one single crochet decrease, one single crochet, and one single crochet decrease). Row eleven should have two stitches (two single crochets). Row twelve should have one stitch (one single crochet decrease).  The basic triangle is finished at this point. To smooth out the edges, work one single crochet into each stitch around the sides of the work and three single crochets into the gap at each point.          Cut the yarn, leaving a 2 inch (5 cm) tail. Pull this tail through the loop on your hook and tighten it to tie off the triangle. Weave the tail into the back of the work to hide it.	Create a foundation chain. Work 12 single crochets across the chain. Decrease twice in the next row. Single crochet in each stitch. Decrease twice in the fourth row. Single crochet in each stitch for the fifth row. Repeat this pattern for another seven rows. Single crochet around the edge of the piece.
No matter how well thought out your beat is, if you're just using an 808 kick and a weak General MIDI snare, no one is going to want to listen to your beat. It's important to find drum kits and loops with some extra flair to really make a good beat. There are many producer packs you can download to get a wide range of effective kicks, snares, hi-hats, and claps.; , Different genres of music have different rules and structures for beats. Most hip hop beats have syncopated kicks and a snare or clap every other bar. Often, closed hi-hats are used to play 16th notes, while open hats are put in the offbeat. This is common for more contemporary sounding beats and is used in a lot of dirty south, crunk, hyphy, and glam rap, but some more older beat uses hat.  Very few good hip hop or rap beats are made without some form of repetitive loop. Different rap producers use different kinds of instruments and sounds to make effective loops. Timbaland uses a lot of synths and ethnic instruments, while Dr. Dre uses a lot of orchestral hits. Mf Doom uses vintage sounds often from old cartoons. The type of sounds you use to make your track should reflect the general emotions you want that particular track to convey and your own style. Experiment with what sounds best. When you have the sound fonts you want to use, figure out some rhythmic loops and try not to make them too complex or the rapper will have to work harder for the listener's attention. Figure out another simple loop for the chorus that should be catchier then the rest. After a couple verses, try an instrumental bridge, and then go back in for the last few verses.  This is pretty easy if you've already written your loops. Try to make something that augments the original loop but doesn't compete with it. Well made bass lines are subtle and add to the song rather then just arbitrarily hang in the background.  Try adding a small amount of reverb to your snare or clap, and a bass boost to the kick. Make sure to use effects in moderation, not to distort the track and make it unlistenable.  Make sure the beat is loud enough to be heard without overpowering the main melody. The hi-hats should be quieter than the kick and snare. Experiment with the sound levels until you are satisfied with the end result.	Get Tight Sounds. Understand the Structure of a Beat. Make Instrumental Loops. Make a Bassline. Add Effects. Master the Track.
Because crystal is made with lead, it feels heavier than glass. Pick up the object and you should notice it feels solid and with some heft. Pick up a glass object of a comparable size. Most likely, it will feel light.Lead-free crystal feels lighter and more durable but still shines when held up to the light., Due to the sculpting process, crystal has a smooth, rounded feel. Touch any decorative facets you find. Also run your hand along the object’s surface. Glass feels more brittle, even though crystal is more fragile. The cut on the glass may also feel sharper., Flick the object with your finger or tap it against something solid. If it is crystal, it will ring. If it is glass, it will produce a thud.Wet your finger and rub it around the object’s rim, if possible. Crystal will produce a musical tone, but glass won’t.	Check the object’s weight. Feel the object for sharpness. Strike the object to test its sound.
You'll need to measure from your waist to the desired spot on your leg for length and around your waist. The first one will be how long your petticoat is (from waist to knee, say) and the second one gives you the proper length around (it'll bunch up significantly).   Once you have your waist measurement, multiply it by 2 1/2. That's how long your piece of material needs to be. Cut your fabric (tulle or crinoline) with these two measurements in mind.  For the purposes of this article, tulle will be referred to as the fabric.  ; , This will form the base of your skirt shape. Since tulle is rough to the touch, you'll want to use your sewing machine to sew down both sides of the seam, keeping it from being itchy and irritating.   Start from the bottom and go to the top, leaving an opening to step into.  There are a few ways to do this and if you know of another, by all means use it. Here is one method to get the job done:   Use a buttonhole thread and zig-zag across it, creating a channel to use for gathering later. You may need a special foot on your machine to do this. The thread should be able to be pulled out when you're finished. Sew from the inside-out; the material will travel better as you sew along the loop if you do it from this side.  You'll want a length that's long enough for your waist, plus an inch or two (2.5 to 5 cm) for overlap. Place a pin at the mid-point and quarter-points. Do the same to your tulle (this is to make sure your fabric gets spread evenly along the waistband).  It will force the tulle to gather as you do so. Continue this action until the tulle is gathered to the desired width for your waist. When the pins match up, that's it!   Pin the grosgrain to the top of the tulle at different lengths. For the final pin, wrap the buttonhole thread around it to keep it from moving as you sew.  Pin the tulle evenly to the grosgrain as this will be how it lies when finished.  Since tulle rips fairly easily, the zigzag is a good stitch to use. Once you've sewn all the way around, remove all the pins. Double-check to see if you've missed any!   If there's any excess tulle above your seam, trim it down with a pair of scissors. It'll be less itchy and less likely to tear.  This fills out the waistband, reinforces it, and keeps the edge of the tulle from irritating your skin. Just eyeball it as you sew.   You can use a straight stitch for this part. Sew the bias binding at the top and bottom, with a negligible seam on either side.  Remember how you didn't sew it all the way up at the beginning? That's so you can hook it together as need be. Now's the time to add a hook and clasp and then you're finished!   Whatever style you have at your disposal should work. The grosgrain and bias binding are sturdy enough to support most clasps. If you'd like ruffles, use the same method you did with the waistband and simply add a long, wide strip to the bottom.	Grab your measuring tape. Join the two cut edges. Sew the top of the tulle at the waistline to prepare for gathering. Grab some petersham grosgrain. Pull out the buttonhole thread. Sew the grosgrain to the tulle with the zigzag stitch. Add bias binding to the opposite side of your grosgrain. Add a hook and clasp to either of the open sides.
For this no-bake clay recipe, you will need the following ingredients:          2 cups baking soda 1 ¼ cup water 1 cup cornstarch  , In a saucepan, combine the baking soda and cornstarch. Slowly add the water into the mixture. Continue stirring the mixture while heating it over medium heat. This should take about 4-5 minutes.         The mixture will start thickening up quickly. When it is almost the same consistency as playdough, the clay is done.  When the clay has reached the appropriate thickness, remove the saucepan and pour the mixture onto a clean surface. Cover with a dishtowel until cool.          You may have to spoon out the mixture if you can't get it to pour from the saucepan. Once the dough has started to cool, knead it until it's thin and smooth. You can also use a rolling pin.  If you'd like a variation of the no-bake clay that doesn't require any cooking, use this recipe instead.          Gather the following ingredients: 3/4 cup flour, 1/2 cup salt, and 1/2 cup cornstarch. Mix the ingredients in a mixing bowl. Slowly add warm water until the clay mixture starts becoming hard. Sprinkle flour on a clean surface, and place the clay on top of it. Knead the clay.  The clay should be easily shaped into different shapes. If it gets a little too hard, add a tiny bit of water.Allow the shaped clay to dry overnight before painting.         Paint the figures using acrylic paint or other types of craft paint. Add glitter, accents, or other craft accessories to your figures and shapes. To change the color of the clay, add food coloring to the clay. Separate the clay into different sections to make different colored clays. You can seal the clay when you're finished by adding a clear coat, such as shellac, acrylic spray, or clear nail polish.	Gather the ingredients. Mix the ingredients. Remove from heat. Try an alternate no saucepan, no-bake recipe. Shape the clay into figures.
Unfurl the snake and lower the bulbous metal end into the toilet bowl. Begin the feeding the snake into the mouth of the drain. At the end of the snake is a curved hook, which will help break up and grab debris that has accumulated in the pipes.; , Once the snake is in position, start steadily rotating the handle on the opposite end. This will extend the snake and force its length slowly through the pipes. Plumbing snakes are constructed with flexible metal coils, so it will be able to bend and follow the contours of the pipes as it is unwound.Unclogging a toilet with a snake is as simple as turning the crank a few times.  If you notice the snake slowing down or coming to a stop, it may have encountered resistance. Jostle the shaft slightly to help the snake loosen up whatever is stuck deep in the pipes. Continue turning the handle in a clockwise direction until the snake clears the pipe.Don’t be rough with the shaft of the snake or try to draw out the clog by force. Just keep winding and unwinding and let it wear down the clog on its own.  After you locate and work over the clog, rotate the handle in the opposite direction (counterclockwise) to retract the snake and examine what it has collected. Always pull out the clog rather than trying force it deeper into the pipe. Repeat this process until the pipe is completely unobstructed.Pushing the clog further in may end up making the problem worse, as eventually it can get so deep that you can no longer reach it.Always make sure to sanitize your snake after each use. This can be accomplished by rinsing the snake off outside with a garden hose. You can also leave the end of the snake in the toilet for a few flushes after you've added toilet bowl cleaner., Lay down a couple of towels or a sheet of plastic to protect the floor. It’s possible that water may splash out of the toilet bowl as the snake works on the clog. This water will often become dingy as whatever is causing the clog disintegrates and leeches back through the pipes. Covering the floor can keep you from having to deal with a second mess later on.If you’re using a towel, wash it immediately after you’re finished and wipe down the floor beneath with a disinfecting solution.  Things are likely to get messy, so pull on a pair of rubber gloves to provide a barrier between your bare skin and whatever muck you may find on the other end of the snake. Toilets are full of germs, and if you don’t take proper care to protect your hands and keep them clean, the result may be illness and infection. Throw the gloves away when you’re finished and wash your hands for a full minute with antibacterial soap and hot water.Debris that is snagged on the end of the snake will have to be removed by hand. Don’t forget to roll up your shirtsleeves as you work to get them out of the way.  You’ve managed to pull out the clog that’s been blocking the pipe, but now what do you do with it? Rather than trying to flush it again and risk creating a new problem, have a trash bag or bucket on hand that you can put the icky clog material into. That way, you can simply drop the bag in the garbage or give the bucket a good rinse and carry on with your day.A plastic grocery bag makes a perfect means of disposal. After you drop the offending clog inside, tie off the bag and chuck it in the trash.  Once the job is finished, plunge the toilet a few times to get rid of any remnants of the clog. Then, pour some concentrated toilet bowl cleaner into the toilet and give it a couple flushes. The chemicals in toilet cleaning solutions are potent enough to dissolve and whisk away whatever residual debris remains in the pipes. As an added bonus, your latrine will be sparkly clean, sanitized and ready for use afterwards.Only use cleaners that are intended for toilets. Regular drain cleaners can eat through galvanized plumbing pipes and wreak havoc on septic systems.A homemade declogging solution made from vinegar and baking soda can also work wonders on clearing out your pipes after they've been snaked. Simply pour about a cup of baking soda into the bowl, add two cups of vinegar (gradually, so that the mixture doesn't bubble over into the floor), wait ten minutes and flush., Before putting anything in the toilet, make sure that it’s meant to be there. The list of things it’s okay to flush down the commode is pretty short: in most cases, human waste and toilet paper only. Never try to get rid of paper towels, Kleenex tissues, makeup pads, tampons, condoms, cardboard, hair or any other materials that aren’t easily dissolved by flushing them. You’ll just be setting yourself up for inconvenience (and possibly expensive plumbing repairs) later on.Toys are a leading culprit of clogs in households with small children. If you have kids, keep the door to your bathroom shut and make sure they know that it’s not a good place to play. If you’re not sure whether or not a certain item is safe to flush down the toilet, chances are it isn’t.  Most clogs are caused by a buildup of excess toilet paper that gets stuck in the pipes before it has time to completely break down. Be aware of the amount of toilet paper you flush on a regular basis, and see that you only use as much as you need. If you have multiple bathrooms in your home, try using a different one from time to time so that one toilet’s plumbing isn’t constantly getting overworked.Be conservative. There’s no need to use half a roll of paper every time you wipe.If you often find yourself troubled with clogs, consider switching to single ply toilet paper. It may not be as comfortable or absorbing, but it breaks down much faster after it’s flushed.  The best way to prevent a clog is to take note when you suspect one might be building up. If the water level in your toilet seems low, or it has trouble flushing or refills slowly, there may be an obstruction throttling the water flow somewhere. Use a plunger to dislodge clogs before they get bad enough that you have to break out the snake.Look for bubbles in the water in the toilet bowl and keep an ear out for rattling in the pipes. These could also be signs of blockage. Snaking should be reserved for stubborn clogs. Plunging, cleaning and not putting anything in the toilet that doesn’t belong there should be your first defenses. If you’re careful, you’ll rarely find yourself in a situation that requires the use of an auger.  Make sure that you’re cleaning your potty at least once or twice a month. Use chemicals specifically formulated for use in toilets and pay attention to any signs that suggest a clog might be forming. As has already been mentioned, chemical cleaners can help melt down stubborn clots of toilet paper and other gunk that’s become lodged in the pipes. Besides that, it will keep the place where you do your business fresh and pleasant.Cleaning your toilet’s water jets ensures that it’s flushing at full power, which will help knock out potential messes caught in the plumbing.	Place the end of the snake into the toilet. Turn the crank handle clockwise. Feel around for the clog in the pipes. Break up or pull out as much of the clog as you can. Cover the floor around the toilet. Wear gloves. Have a trash bag or other receptacle ready. Flush the pipes with toilet cleaner. Only put water-soluble items in the toilet. Reduce the amount of toilet paper you use. Identify the problem early. Keep the toilet and pipes clean.
Because of the algae needs water flow and floats, you can place it in the sump compartment of the aquarium filter system. Sump compartments are the secondary tanks that are connected to the display aquarium tank that helps filter the water.This will allow the algae to absorb the nitrates and phosphates it needs for growth., After the algae has filtered the nitrates and phosphates, you can move the algae into the main part of the aquarium. You can prune part of the algae and place it in the tank for the fish to eat. Alternately, you can move the entire plant into the main aquarium part for the fish to eat on., If you don’t want to place the ulva algae in the sump compartment, you can place it directly in your aquarium. You can drop it in the water, where it will float on top of the water., Algae is a free floating plant. However, you can attach it to a rock or shell in your aquarium. Use a touch of superglue to attach the algae to whatever surface you want in your tank. Alternately, you can try tying a string around part of the algae and the surface you want to anchor it to.	Put the algae in the sump compartment. Move it to the main aquarium. Drop the algae in the aquarium water. Anchor the algae to a surface.
This will make it easier to create your 3D drawing.; , Draw lightly at first so you can erase any unnecessary pencil marks later.  At this point don't worry if they are completely visible in real life. They will help finish your drawing.  Move to a different angle if you need to see where some lines should go. Once you have finished the basic outline, erase any line you cannot actually see from the angle in which you are drawing.  Begin drawing the details in pencil, then retrace with ink. Once the ink is finished add the coloring and shading for the object.	Choose the object you would like to draw, sit in front of it or at an angle. First draw the base of the object and work your way up. Sketch the lines that will make up the pieces you can't completely see. Sketch in the rest of the object's frame. Trace over the outline in ink, and erase the pencil line after the ink has dried.

Determine the length of your rake holder and then saw off the handle using an electric saw. Take safety precautions before using the electric saw and make one clean cut at the designated area.   Use sandpaper to soften the sawed off edges. Polish with a soft cloth.      ; , Use liquid dish detergent and hot water to clean the rake.   Dry thoroughly before use.  Most likely the place where the handle began would be ideal.   Find a place on the wall that will hold the rake. Consider marking that spot with a pencil.  Drill ¾ of the way into the wall leaving enough room to hold the rake.   Hang your utensils or glassware!	Remove rake handle. Scrub rake, especially if you are recycling an old rake. Identify the area of the rake that can be mounted to the wall. Drill screw into an area you’ve marked on the wall.
If the boot tray needs cleaning, do so now and dry thoroughly before proceeding.; , If making a pattern, you could do something like these suggestions:  Add different shades of pebbles in varying ways, such as stripes, wavy stripes, geometric shapes, etc.       Design a letter, number or symbol in the center or across the pebbles; use differently colored pebbles to make it obvious.   Work in small sections at a time, starting at a corner edge and working methodically across the tray. Paint a small area of the tray's corner with glue, then add a dab of glue to each pebble.       Press the pebble in place. Keep the pebble as flat as possible––the surface should not be too bumpy for the boots and shoes to sit on.       Repeat for each pebble in that section.       Move onto the next section. Move across and add pebbles according to your pattern or randomly.  When you near the end, it is a good idea to test which pebbles will fit before adding the glue, as there may be some rearranging required before everything will fit neatly. Try not to leave large gaps!  , Also follow the manufacturer's instructions with respect to time.  Paint or spray a suitable sealant across the top of the pebbles.  Encourage all members of the household to place their muddy, wet or snow-covered boots and shoes on the tray to drain.  Wipe down and wash it regularly. It may also need to be drained every few days if water has amassed in it from melting snow, etc.	Place the tray on a newspaper covered work surface. Decide whether you want to make a pattern with the pebbles or just add them randomly. Use the glue to attach the pebbles. Continue until all the pebbles are in place. Let dry for at least 24 hours before going to the next step. Apply a sealant. Place the pebble boot tray in your mudroom or entrance way. Keep the tray clean.
Before adding anything to alter the soil pH, always make sure to test your soil to see how far it is from your goal pH. You can purchase a test at your local home/garden center or take a sample to your county extension office for professional testing.  The pH of your garden soil is easy to determine with a commercial pH testing kit. These are usually sold at hardware stores or garden supply stores and are fairly inexpensive. To begin, you'll want to take a sample from the area you want to test. Dig five small holes (about six to eight inches deep). Select random locations within the plot — this way, you'll get a sense of the "average" pH of your soil.Don't keep any of the dirt from creating the holes.   Note that the instructions in this section are generalized — you should use the instructions included with your specific pH testing kit.  Next, use your shovel or spade to take a narrow "slice" from the side of each hole. This slice should be crescent-shaped and about 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) thick. Try to make your sample about the same size for each hole. Add your samples to a single clean, dry bucket.   Try to gather enough dirt in each sample that you have about a pint (0.94 liters) or more in total. For most methods of testing, this is plenty.  Allow your soil to dry until you can no longer detect moisture.   It's important to make sure your soil is completely dry before proceeding — moisture can cause an inaccurate pH reading., Depending on the type of kit you have, the method will vary. For many of the most common test kits, you'll put a small amount of your soil in an included test tube, add a few drops of liquid solution, mix by shaking, and allow the mixture to settle for a few hours.Eventually, the color of the solution should change — by comparing the color of the solution to a chart provided with the kit, you can determine the pH of your soil.   Other types of kits exist as well, so be sure to use the instructions provided with your kit. For instance, some modern electronic testing kits determine a soil pH almost instantaneously via a metal probe. You can also collect a sample and take it into your county extension office for a free soil test.  Many types of organic matter, like compost, composted manure, and acidic mulches (e.g. pine needles) can gradually lower your soil pH over time.As organic matter decomposes, bacteria and other microbes grow and feed upon it, creating acidic by-products in the process. Because organic matter needs time to decompose to alter the soil, this option is great for long-term goals, but won't give you dramatic results in the short-term. Many gardeners opt to add organic matter to their soil annually for a gradual, mild pH-lowering effect. However, this will not work for heavy clay soils.   Organic matter can also give your soil other benefits — most noticeably, improving its drainage and aeration., For rapid pH-lowering, don't rely on the slow, gradual decay of organic matter. Instead, use one of the many acidic soil additives available at your local garden supply store. Of these additives, aluminum sulfate, is one of the quickest-acting options available. Aluminum sulfate produces acidity in the soil as soon as it dissolves, which, for gardening purposes, means that it basically works instantly.Because of this, aluminum sulfate is a great choice for urgent pH lowering.   Depending on the starting pH of your soil, the amount of aluminum sulfate you should use can vary significantly. In very general terms, you should expect to use about 1.2 pounds of aluminum sulfate to lower the pH of a 10-square foot patch of soil by one on the pH scale (e.g., from 7.0 to 6.0, from 6.0 to 5.0, etc.).However, using too much additive can be harmful to your plant, so consult an online resource (like the one here) for more precise usage information. Do not use aluminum sulfate for large applications because it can lead to aluminum accumulation and aluminum toxicity in soil., Another useful pH-lowering soil additive is sublimed sulfur. Compared to aluminum sulfate, sulfur is generally cheaper, more powerful (in terms of the amount needed) and slower-acting. This is because sulfur needs to be metabolized by bacteria in the soil to be converted to sulfuric acid, which takes time.Depending on the moisture of the soil, the amount of bacteria present, and the temperature, sulfur can take up to several months to produce a noticeable effect in the soil.   As noted above, compared to aluminum sulfate, you will generally need a relatively small amount of pure, sublimed sulfur to produce an equivalent pH change. In general, you'll need about 0.2 pounds of sulfur to lower the pH of a 10-square foot patch of soil by one whole number on the pH scale.Consult an online resource (like the one here) for more precise usage information.  Like sulfur and aluminum sulfate, soil additives containing sulfur-coated urea can increase the acidity of soil over time (lowering its pH). As an additive, urea is fairly quick-acting, producing some effects as soon as a week or two after being introduced to the soil.Sulfur-coated urea is a common ingredient in many fertilizers, so if you were already planning on fertilizing your plants, you may want to save yourself the trouble of finding a separate soil additive by simply picking a fertilizer containing this type of urea.   Sulfur-coated urea content will vary from fertilizer to fertilizer, so consult the instructions that come with your fertilizer to determine the right amount to use for your gardening needs. Sulfur-coated urea is a slow-release fertilizer that doses nutrients out slowly as your plants need them, rather than distributing them all at once.  Besides the additives listed above, many other substances can lower soil pH. Many of these substances are often included in certain fertilizer mixes, while others are sold on their own. The time and amount needed can vary greatly for each, so consult the additive packaging or talk to an experienced employee at the gardening supply store. Additives that can lower your soil pH:Diammonium phosphate Ferric sulfate Peat Ammonium nitrate  , If your soil is too alkaline (basic) to grow plants which require acidic soil, raising alkaline-loving plants can gradually lower the pH of your soil over the life of the plant. As the plant grows, matures, and decays, the organic matter that returns to the soil will promote the growth of bacteria and gradually lower the pH level of the soil (similar to how adding organic matter in the form of mulch or manure). This method is generally one of the slowest ways to lower your soil pH, as the plant must grow to begin depositing organic matter in the soil. A few examples of alkaline-tolerant plants:Certain evergreen shrubs (e.g., boxwoods, California lilacs) Certain deciduous shrubs (e.g., lilacs, mock oranges, Forsythia species) Certain perennials (e.g., picks, hellebores)  , Certain types of flowering shrubs, like rhododendron and azalea plants, require fairly acidic soil to grow properly. These plants are often native to areas with a high amount of rainfall, like the Pacific Northwest region of the United States (frequent rainfall generally lowers soil pH).For these types of shrubs, a pH range of about 4.5 - 5.5 is optimal. However, pH levels as high as 6.0 are usually acceptable., Many brightly-colored flowers, like petunias and begonias, grow best in acidic soils. For some of these flowers, changing a soil acidity from slightly acidic to very acidic can produce a visible change in the bloom color. For instance, growing a hydrangea in soil with a pH level of about 6.0 - 6.2 will produce a plant with pink flowers, while lowering the pH level to about 5.2 - 5.5 will produce a plant with purple/blue flowers.The blue color of low-pH hydrangeas comes from the chemical aluminum. When the pH of the soil is low, it's easier for the hydrangea to absorb aluminum from the soil, which shows in the flower petals., Many needled evergreen trees grow in slightly acidic soil. For instance, spruces, firs, and pines all thrive in soils with a pH level of about 5.5 - 6.0. In addition, the needles of these types of trees can be introduced to neutral or alkaline soil as organic matter which lowers soil pH as the needles decay.  Perhaps the most well-known acid-loving plant is the blueberry, which thrives in highly acidic soils (generally about 4.0 - 5.0 is ideal). However, several other species of berry also favor acidic soil. For instance, cranberries grow best at a level of about 4.2 - 5.0, while gooseberries, currants, and elderberries grow best at a level of about 5.5 - 6.5., Most varieties of garden ferns prefer soil pH levels below 7.0 — even those that prefer alkaline soils can usually tolerate slightly acidic soils. For instance, Maidenhair Ferns prefer soil pHs of about 7.0 - 8.0 but can grow even in soils with levels of about 6.0.Some ferns can even tolerate soils with a pH as low as 4.0., The number of plants that survive or thrive in low pH soils is too great to list in this article. For more information, you may want to consult a comprehensive botanical resource. You can usually find these at gardening stores or specialty book stores, though many are also available. For instance, the official site of The Old Farmer's Almanac contains a table listing the pH preferences of many different types of plants (you can access it here).	Test the soil pH. Dig five small holes in the planting area. Take a sample from each hole. Mix the soils in the bucket and spread on newspaper to dry. Use your testing kit to determine the precise pH level of your soil. Add organic matter. Add aluminum sulfate. Add sulfur. Add sulfur-coated urea. Add another acidic additive. Grow alkaline-tolerant plants. Lower soil pH for shrubs like rhododendrons and azaleas. Lower soil pH for flowers like begonias and hydrangeas. Lower soil pH for evergreen trees. Reduce the soil pH for certain berries. Drop the pH to just below neutral for ferns. Consult a gardening resource for a comprehensive list of acid-loving plants.
This step is important as it lets people know what you're doing and to come and join in. Before you advertise, it's a good idea to have a catchy name and descriptive phrase and a distinctive graphic design for your Theatre's name. Use colors that stand out, to grab people's attention. And have an email address and phone number ready for taking messages so that these can be included with the advertising materials. It's a good idea to encourage people to join early, so that you can begin to get an idea of numbers; to this end, try to include an early joining incentive as part of your advertising, such as a discount, if you're charging fees or an extra ticket for family for the final show. Some ways to advertise include:   A good way to advertise is to get a magnetic giant sticker with your organization's name, phone number and your goal for actors (short, like a catchy motto), and put it on your car. Every time you drive, people will see it.  Put a classified ad in the newspaper. It will cost a little more, but a lot of people may see it. Ask whether this is also repeated in the online version of the newspaper––classifieds often are now. Get picket signs with your key information printed on them and put them up around town (with permission) to advertise. Make small posters and flyers. Place these in strategic locations like local shop windows (ask first), library bulletin boards, school message boards, washateria board, church boards, etc. Wherever people gather in a community space is a good place to advertise. Set up a Twitter and Facebook account. Share the links with friends and ask them to pass it on. Leave useful information on both accounts and update regularly to keep people noticing your presence.	Advertise your Readers' Theatre. Emphasize that Readers' Theatre plays promote confidence, reading skills and good study habits using simple scripts for plays such as books, holiday themes and classics such as Cinderella that are appropriate an d fun for children to perform.
If the fabric you are working with is dirty, then wash it and let it dry completely. This method will work best on canvas shoes and bags., You might want to use pure beeswax for this, without any additives. Anything else may contain harmful chemicals., You can do this by blowing them with a hairdryer or leaving them out in the hot sun for a few minutes. This will make the wax easier to apply. You do not want the clothes to be hot, and you do not want the wax to be melted., Rub it side-to-side and up-and-down. This will help the wax get into the weave of the fabric.If you are covering a piece of clothing or a bag, use the corners of the wax to get into small seams and spaces., Gently rub the wax into small, tight areas, such as seams, corners, and pockets. If the item you are covering has buttons, make sure to wipe the wax off., This will allow the wax to melt into the fabric. You will see the fabric becoming a little darker., If there are any pools or puddles of wax, run your fingers across the fabric in circular motions to smooth it out. This will give your piece a nice finish., Leave it there for 24 hours.After this time, the waxed article will be ready to use. You may notice that the fabric is a little stiffer and darker than before. This is normal. The fabric will soften with time, but it won't get lighter again.	Start with a clean piece of fabric. Purchase a bar of natural beeswax. Heat the wax and cloths a little. Rub the beeswax across the fabric in both directions. Spread the wax out with your fingers to make it move even. Heat the item again with a hair dryer for about five minutes. Smooth the item again with your fingers, if necessary. Set the item to cure in a warm, dry place.
The first and most important step to correcting understeer while cornering is mental. You need to recognize what the vehicle is doing as understeer in order to take corrective action to address it.Identifying that you are in an understeer situation is the only way you can know to correct it. Pay close attention to the response you get from your vehicle to identify understeer.; , When you turn the steering wheel and find the vehicle not responding by turning as much as it should, the natural response is to turn the wheel even more. Once that fails to work, the next natural reaction is to hit the brakes as you realize you have limited control of the direction the vehicle is traveling. These are both dangerous responses to understeer that can result in an accident.Turning more and hitting your brakes could lock the tires and remove any control you currently have over the vehicle. If the brakes do slow the vehicle quickly, the weight of the vehicle will shift onto the front wheels that are turned too far, resulting in the vehicle suddenly and wildly changing directions.  Once you’ve realized that you are in an understeer situation, calmly return the steering wheel to straight. If you are in a corner, turn into the direction you are skidding slightly. This will align the wheels with the direction the vehicle is moving, allowing the tires to start turning again to create grip.Point the wheels in the same direction the vehicle is moving to allow the tires to start spinning again. Make sure to maintain total control of the wheel as you allow it to center itself.  While slamming on the brakes could result in locking up your tires, easing off the accelerator pedal will slow the vehicle in a more subtle manner. As the vehicle slows, the weight will transfer toward the front of the vehicle, adding to the traction your front tires are able to get.Be sure to straighten the wheel out before easing off the throttle to avoid the vehicle turning suddenly as grip returns to the tires. Easing off the throttle will only work if the tires are pointed in the direction the vehicle is moving.  If easing off the throttle did not change the speed of the vehicle sufficiently to return traction to your front wheels, put your foot on the brake and apply them gradually to avoid locking the tires up again and losing steering control.Be careful not to press on the brake pedal too hard or abruptly. If you lock up the front tires under braking, take your foot back off the brake pedal to allow the wheels to begin turning again.	Identify that you’re in an understeer situation. Control your natural response to understeer. Unwind the steering wheel. Ease off the throttle. Apply brakes if need be.
Both NiMh and NiCd batteries can be recharged over time, but you might want to think about investing in NiMh batteries over NiCd. NiMh batteries use newer technology to store more charge and can also be fast, slow, or trickle charged.Check the product in which you plan on using your batteries before purchasing your batteries. Certain equipment may require either NiMh or NiCd to operate best.; , These are one of the least expensive varieties of battery chargers available on the consumer market. A pre-set shutoff timer will charge all batteries in the charger for a period of time and shut off once that time has elapsed.These chargers are less precise than smart chargers, which can lead to under- and over-charging. Take this into account when buying a timer charger; over-charged batteries can be ruined and cost you more money.  Smart chargers can be more expensive initially, but these are equipped with sensors that detect missing voltage in your batteries. This way, your charger will continue to charge your battery until it has reached full charge, saving you the cost of batteries ruined from over-charging., The rechargeable batteries you bought earlier will also help you to decide which charger you invest in. Some chargers are intended for only NiMh or NiCd batteries, though some universal chargers are available.Most AA and AAA battery chargers can be used for both NiMh and NiCd batteries, though you should always consult your manual to be certain.  You should never attempt to charge a battery that isn't intended to be rechargeable. This can cause a dangerous explosion from hydrogen gas buildup and may ruin your battery or charger as well.Check the manual that came with your charger to know the recommended safety procedure for your charger, but generally you should:   Keep your charger and batteries away from fire or intense heat. Do not charge your batteries around or on top of flammable materials, including flammable gases, like gasoline vapor. Insert your batteries into your charger firmly before plugging in your charger. Prevent your charger from being exposed to rain, snow, water, and oil., These kind of batteries experience what is called the "memory effect." This means that if you charge your battery before it is completely dead, your battery will remember the smaller capacity as its full potential, which will hurt your battery life., Some batteries may have a specific amperage for best results. This may include charge times for "fast" or "standard" charge speeds. Always follow manufacturer recommendations for best results and safest use.   As an example, you may see that your battery might have "Std. CHARGE: 60mA 14 - 16 hrs" written on it. This battery would charge best at 60 milliamps for a minimum of 14 hours.  Some chargers come with an interface or a timer that you might need to set. You may be able to set the rate of charge (fast, quick, normal, slow, trickle) as a function of capacity. This is represented by a fraction of the capacity, represented by the format "C/#".You should also set your timer with respect to your charge rate (C-rate).   For example, charging your battery at C/10 will charge 10% of your batteries full capacity per hour, charging your battery fully in a little over 10 hours, depending on efficiency of your charger. Many manufacturers recommend slower rates of charging. Faster charging will result in less efficient charging.  This should be done before you plug your charger into an electrical outlet, unless otherwise indicated by your charger manual. Once you feel the batteries click into place, you can plug in your charger and begin charging.  Once your timer is up or the display on your charger indicates that all batteries are fully charged, as is usually the case with smart chargers, unplug your charger and remove the batteries. If you find that your batteries are difficult to remove, use a gentle tapping motion until one is jarred free.	Learn the differences in battery chemistry to prolong battery life. Evaluate time controlled chargers. Optimize with smart chargers. Purchase an appropriate charger. Follow safe usage guidelines. Wait until the battery is completely drained for NiCds. Check for noted charge rates. Set your charger, if necessary. Insert your batteries. Remove all charged cells.
Come up with a figure you’d ideally like to pay to rent an RV. Do some quick research online or at an RV dealer to get an idea of what some typical rental prices are. You may need more beyond your decided number for deposits or to negotiate. It’s helpful to come up with a maximum number that you absolutely won’t go over.   Write down the number of nights and the approximate number of miles of the trip you plan to take in an RV. RV rentals will often have a per night and/or per mile rate, so it’s helpful to have these numbers on hand to estimate rental prices.; , There are towable RVs—like travel trailers and camper trailers—that attach to the back of your vehicle, and there are motorized RVs—like type A, B, or C motorhomes—that are self-contained with a driving cab.It’s important to decide on an RV type according to your needs, the number of people you’re traveling with, the price you’re willing to pay, and your vehicle’s towing capacity if you’re choosing a towable RV. Opt for a smaller RV for easier navigation if you can, especially if you’re a first-time renter.   For a towable RV, you’ll generally need a vehicle with a high towing capacity, a hitch rated at 5,000 pounds, and an electronic brake controller installed in your vehicle or the proper wiring to rent and attach one.In most states you need only a normal driver’s license to operate any RV recreationally, but some states do require a special commercial or non-commercial license for larger/heavier RVs. Check with your state’s Department of Transportation., Expect to see rental prices per night for RVs, and know that the same renter can have different per night rates depending on the season (usually rates are higher in peak vacation months like July and August). There could also be a per mile rate, which might be something like 34 to 45 cents per mile. Rates will also vary by the type, size, and condition (or age) of the RV.Note that some rental companies will want to place a hold on your credit card while you’re in possession of the vehicle.  Expect extra costs beyond the rental rate for possible things like a security deposit, a small charge for the RV’s generator or propane, additional vehicle insurance, and the price for kitchen utensils and bedding if you’re not providing your own.Of course the cost of your trip will also include gas for the RV, campground rates, and food costs.  Check out the For Rent ads in your local newspaper, Craigslist, or other classified ads for RV rentals. Many private owners will rent out their RVs for reasonable prices when they aren’t using them. Also check out local or national RV dealers with rental locations near you.  Call up the renters you find to make sure they’re still offering the RV offered in their ad, and ask about any additional costs there are on top of the per night or per mile rate to get an idea of the true price you’d pay. Choose your favorites based on the best features and price, and narrow your options down to a number that you can reasonably spend the time to visit before booking and embarking on your trip.  Call your prospects again to set up a time to meet. Get a thorough tour of the inside living space and ask to take a test drive if it’s a motorhome. Larger rental companies will be more equipped to give you a full tutorial, often including an educational video. No matter who you’re renting from, be sure to check that everything works properly and ask questions like:   How do I properly hitch and unhitch a towable RV? How and where do I empty wastewater and sewage? How and when do I run the generator, and at what cost? How do I use the propane to light the stove, run the refrigerator, etc., and at what cost?  , You’ll usually need a driver’s license and car insurance for anyone that will drive or tow the RV. Get copies or receipts for any paperwork or transactions you complete.  Make sure you understand all the upfront costs as well as charges you could face later for damages or generator and propane charges.  Especially if you’re renting from a private seller, you may be able to compromise on a price. Let them know your budget, and see what they can offer you. Come up with a rate that they can agree on that doesn’t go over your maximum budget.   If you’re not happy with their final offer for rent, walk away from deal. They might come back to you with a lower price if they want to rent the RV quickly.  Discuss with the renter if they have options for a payment plan. You make be able to make smaller payments over a longer period of time if you wish.	Pin down your budget. Determine the type of RV you need. Compare prices. Consider extra costs. Check classifieds and local dealers. Narrow your search. Arrange to visit and test-drive. Bring your ID or any other necessary materials. Determine if there is a deposit or charges for damage. Negotiate if you can. Agree on a payment plan.
Common places to look are in your driver's manual which comes with the car. You can ask your car care professional. There should also be a Vehicle Information button on your dashboard with a picture of a car, marked with the letter "I". If your car has a VIC, use the following steps.  Sit down comfortably in the driver's seat, and make sure that all of the doors are closed. Tug on each of the handles from inside to make sure they are all closed tight. Make sure that your transmitter is close to the steering wheel and lock buttons.  Put your key in the ignition and turn it all the way clockwise until you hear the engine come on. Make sure that the gear shift is set to park.  If for some reason the display does not appear, restart your car, and repeat the previous steps. If the display still does not appear, contact your nearest GM car care professional., The Set/Reset button should be near the Vehicle Information button. If you cycle past the option, continue pressing the Set/Reset button until the "Remote Key Learning Active" option reappears., Do this for at least fifteen seconds. You should hear a noise that sounds like a chime. This means that your transmitter has been successfully synced. If that does not happen, it is likely the sync is off, in which case you will have to restart the process.  Do this in rapid succession. If you wait too long, it is likely that your car will go out of sync, and you will have to restart the process for whichever transmitters you have left over.  It is important that you do this, otherwise the lock/unlock features in your car will not properly work. This can result in dangerous circumstances where your locks do not work. If you forget, or take too long to take your key out, start the whole process over again for your own safety and convenience., Get out of your car and close the driver's door. Step away from the car about 20 feet. Press the unlock/lock buttons separately. If they work from this distance, step back to a further distance and try your transmitter from there. If you are noticing that your transmitter is not locking and/or unlocking, start the process over again to ensure that it works. If you have repeated the process numerous times with no success, contact your car care professional for further instruction/help.   If the transmitter works at 20 feet but does not work at, say, 40 feet, the transmitter may not have a strong enough signal to travel that far, or that the transmitter's batteries are low.	Determine if your car has a VIC (Vehicle Identity Check). Get in your car. Start your car. Press and hold the Vehicle Information button until the display reads "Press V to Relearn Remote Key.", Press the Set/Reset button until "Remote Key Learning Active" appears on the display. Press and hold the Lock and Unlock buttons at the same time. Repeat the previous step for each transmitter, up to four. Exit programming mode by turning off the vehicle and removing the key. Test your transmitters.
If you are doing companion planting to improve the look of your garden, you should think about what time of year certain plants bloom. If you know that your roses bloom at the beginning of summer, try planting some plants around them that bloom in the spring and at the end of summer.   Planting plants that bloom at different times of year will keep your garden fun and interesting for more of the year. Planting flowers that bloom at different times of the year is especially important if you are growing roses that are not ever-blooming. For roses that only bloom in the spring, try planting annual flowers beneath them, such as marigolds and pansies. This will give you more color throughout the summer., Adding a variety of colors to your garden will make it look dramatic and interesting. You can use companion plants to bring these different and complementary colors to your garden. For example, if your roses are all light pink, consider planting something nearby that has a drastically different color, such as blooms that are blue.You can even pick color schemes for different times of the year. If your roses are one color, such as pink, you could choose reds for spring and oranges for fall. This can be done with marigolds, zinnias, or even lilies. The change of color will add seasonal excitement.Your can bring different colors into your garden with blooms and with the foliage of companion plants. Some plants that have differing foliage colors and textures that work well in the same beds as roses include hostas, lamb's ear, and coleus., In addition to adding additional colors to your beds, companion plants can add interesting and complementary shapes. This could be the shapes of individual leaves or the shapes of the plants overall.   When using contrasting shaped plants you can use plants that enhance the look of the rose. There are some plants that can mask the weaker aspects of the rose, such as their sparse bottoms. For instance, lavender, catmint, lady’s mantle, and dianthus can all be great planted around roses.	Use plants that flower at different times of year. Pick plants with differing colors. Pick plants that add contrasting shapes.
Pruning done only for the health of the plant should be scheduled for the late winter or early spring, before new growth has had much chance for development.   Since burning bushes are primarily grown for their foliage, you don't need to worry too much about accidentally removing flower buds. The most vibrant foliage will grow on new branches, though, so it is still best to trim the bush before new growth has developed. When you decide to prune a burning bush for the health of the plant alone, you only need to worry about removing branches that could encourage disease to spread through the plant and destroy it. Even if you opt to prune the plant for shape, you should still prune it for health before worrying shape maintenance.; , Use pruning shears to cut away any dead branches or branches that have been severely injured.Branches are most often injured by disease, insect infestation, animals, or bad weather. Cut diseased branched down to their point of origin on the main stem. Doing so is the only way to make sure that the disease does not spread. Injured branches can be cut back to their point of origin on the main stem, or you may wish to only cut away the injured portion of the branch. In the latter case, cut the injured branch down to a side branch and make the cut 1/4 inch (6 mm) above the bud.  Look for any branches or branch stubs that are intertwined or rubbing against each other. Use pruning shears to remove these branches, as well.   Cut these branches down to their point of origin on the main stem. Problem branches like these will typically grow back again in the same direction, so it is best to remove them completely instead of trimming them down.	Prune in late winter or early spring. Remove dead or dying branches. Cut away branches that rub together.
A group of at least 2-5 people is needed to run buses. ,,, Never underestimate the power of word of mouth, talk to everyone you know and meet, face to face interaction is the best way to get people involved.  But it is becoming increasingly popular to sell your tickets online. By using PayPal you can sell your tickets online so that people can pay with a credit or debit card. If you don’t have the ability to do this, then please contact www.protestispatriotism.org they will help you set up a PayPal account, and give you space on their website to sell your ticket.  Most groups don’t issue tickets as they just keep a list of names and check them off as people get on the bus.  Bus captains are responsible for making sure the trip is organized, all the riders are on the bus and for informing the riders about the plans and events.  They are a packet that contains a list of events, a basic map, metro info and arrival / departure times and places. They also offend include some fun items such as stickers, small signs along with general info about weather, what to expect and legal info. If you do not want or have time to create your own you can go to www.protestispatriotism.org they will e-mail you the packet that they create and or work with you to create one.  These trips can be long and sometimes boring. Most charter companies have TVs with DVD players so bring a variety of movies. It is also a great opportunity to start conversation, debate and do some training.	Establish a working group. Give yourself lots of time, running buses is best tackled with 3 months of lead time, but can be done in as little as 1 month.  , Contact a bus company and get a quote.  , Figure your ticket price.  , Advertise by using e-mail lists, fliers and all local media sources that you can utilize. Selling your tickets- you can take check or cash for the tickets. Keep a list of all the people who have bought tickets. Choose bus captains and a medic. Make an info packet, info packets are a great resource and tool for bus riders. Plan the bus trip.
Even if the composition you're writing isn't ultimately meant to be heard on the piano, hearing other finished compositions when you're trying to get inspired can be just the thing you need.   Classical and jazz are the two most noteworthy styles of piano playing. Even if you're only going to be playing in one or the other (or a more contemporary style like pop) it's a good idea to give a listen to these different styles. Keep an ear out for the different chords the players use depending on the style. Look into the work of Liszt, Chopin or Satie for great classically-based piano works. For jazz, Bill Evans, Dave Brubeck and Chick Corea are all players worth looking into.; , Whether you're starting out or an advanced player, warming up your fingers with scales can encourage creativity to flow more freely once you get into the thick of composing. If you know a few scales, try warming up with one you're not as familiar with. Hearing the distinctive tone of a scale might spark the first ideas of a fresh composition.   Scales are a very handy thing to know when it comes time to write melodies. While there's no sure method to write a great melody, knowing which scale you should be using will give you an idea of which notes to use and which to avoid.  Unfortunately, a lot of the time, this happens to fall on the least convenient times where you're either far from an instrument or about to fall asleep. This is why it's a good idea to bring a notebook and/or sound recorder with you wherever you go. If you think of a great melody or rhythm, you can hum it into your mic and adapt it once you're by your piano again.   Most cellphones have a recorder option. If you don't have a cellphone for this purpose, basic handheld recorders tend to be very affordable.  Creativity cannot be forced. If you're trying to break through the writer's block and nothing's working, it may be time to give yourself a break from things. Go do something that has nothing to do with the creative process. Clean your house. Talk to a friend on the phone. Pet a cat. Better yet, take a nap. When you return to it, you don't want to feel any of the frustration you were grappling with before. Creativity is best when you're feeling relaxed.   Going for a walk is a fantastic idea if you're getting frustrated. Many artists have some of their best creative epiphanies when they're out for a stroll.  In some cases, the composer is driven by love and longing. Other times, he's trying to vent out bad emotions. Take a look at your life and single out some of the things that have most affected you in the past while. Have you gone through a break-up? Did you recently go on an unforgettable vacation? Anything that sparks feeling in you is fair game for musical inspiration.	Listen to piano music.There is a vast amount of incredible music written specifically for the piano. Practice scales on the piano. Carry a notebook and handheld recorder wherever you go.You never know when you're going to hit a creative stride. Give yourself a break. Think about what you might like to write music about.Most music (even instrumental music) is directly inspired by something or someone.
Off-brand or generic reeds simply do not play as well or last as long as their more expensive counterparts. Clarinet players of every skill level have had success with Vandorens, but there are other brands out there as well. If price proves to be an obstacle, know where to find deals. While a box of 10 Vandorens may cost 3 or 4 dollars per reed through your local music store, if you buy in bulk from online suppliers, you may be able to get them at half that price.; , Lay new reeds on a flat surface and firmly rub them from the heart to the tip with the back of a teaspoon. This enhances the reed's life expectancy by closing its fibers. , Then dry it, with a cotton cloth of handkerchief, moving towards the tip. Alternatively, if you're in a hurry, just pass it between your thumb and index finger - again, moving towards the tip.  Have three or four good ones with you at any given time, and play with a different one every time, instead of playing on just one reed for a long stretch and then starting over with another new one.  The type of case you need may depend on what type of reed you use, how wet your reeds are when you put them away, and other factors.   Reeds dry best in a well-ventilated case with a ribbed floor, so air can get everywhere. Other cases have glass floors to prevent waves from forming at the tip of the reed. Humidity is always a factor in the lifespan of a reed. Some cases come with replaceable cartridges containing a substance that regulates the humidity level within the case. Avoid storing reeds in the little plastic individual cases they are sold in. While there's nothing wrong with them, it is easier to lose or mix up individually stored reeds, and they'll start to pile up after a while. Never keep reeds in a case that is completely closed. They will go moldy.  This counteracts the effects of your saliva. Leave the reeds in the solution overnight and rinse them well before you use them again.  Don't leave your clarinet standing on its bell with the reed on it (this is a bad idea in the first place, but why risk losing a good reed too?). If you're taking a break from playing, put a mouthpiece cap over the reed to protect it and keep it moist. Don't "wall test" reeds just for the fun of it.	Buy high-quality reeds to start with. Break new reeds in gradually, so the dried material gets used to being wet again. Before playing, soak your reed in clean water instead of wetting it with your saliva, if possible.  , After playing, rinse the reed in clean water. Rotate your reeds. Store your reeds responsibly, with a good reed case. Soak your reeds in a 3% hydrogen peroxide solution (available at your local drugstore) from time to time. Use common sense to avoid broken reeds.
Drumsticks are usually made of either maple, hickory, or a Japanese white oak. Laminated birch has also recently regained popularity. Each has a slightly different feel. The feel has to do with how the stick transmits or absorbs vibration and how much it flexes.Hickory is a common, well rounded wood for drumsticks. Hickory is favored for its flexibility and impact resistance. Maple is much lighter than hickory, allowing for a larger diameter feel without the weight. Maple is softer and stiffer than maple, which negative impacts the sticks durability. Maple sounds sweeter and brighter on drums and cymbals. Oak is dense and heavy, but transmits vibrations more. It tends to be more durable, but will split with little warning. The increased weight gives drums a bigger, darker sound and yields a very big, but brash cymbal sound. Laminated Birch is made from a high quality birch plywood. These sticks are very heavy and durable. They generate very deep sounds from drums and cymbals. There are smaller companies specializing in exotic woods and Vic Firth is currently making a carbon fiber stick. Also, companies like Ahead make sticks out of nylon.; , Tips come in wood, nylon, or delrin. Nylon tips sound brighter on cymbals and hold up longer without chipping or developing soft spots. They don't typically change the sound of the drums, though the lighter tip weight can create a fast rebound, allowing the drum to speak easier. Delrin is used by some companies in place or nylon since it is supposedly more durable.   Wooden tips have a darker contact sound and a less articulate sound on cymbals.  Tips come in a wide variety of shapes, each with its on sound. Common tip shapes are barrel, acorn, ball, and oval. Each shape has a particular sound. Each shape also comes in multiple sizes. Smaller creates a more articulate sound while larger tips create bigger and deeper sounds. Some companies shape their nylon tips like wood tips; others do not.   Barrel tips have a wide, flat contact surface. This creates a dark, but strong contact sound. Acorn tips have the largest contact surface. This dampens the contact sound significantly, creating a full, but dark cymbal sound. Ball tips have a very small contact surface, creating a very bright contact sound. Oval tips are between barrel and ball tips.  The thickness also changes the sound. There are two ways to know the thickness of a stick. The first is by model number. A's are thinner than B's, which are thinner than S's. Higher numbers represent thinner sticks. So, a 7A is thinner than a 5A, which is in turn smaller than a 5B. This system has become unreliable with the wide range of manufacturers each with a large catalog of sticks.   The other way to know the thickness of a stick is to find its diameter. This is usually measured in inches and displayed as a three digit decimal. .500 is a half inch thick, for example. 7As are thinner and lighter. These will sound sweeter on drums and cymbals and are best for lower volume playing. 5As are slightly thicker than the 7A. These are generally considered to be the most generic and versatile stick. 5Bs are thicker, more intense drumsticks and are often used by rock and metal drummers due to their weight. There are many other models and each company has its own idiosyncrasies. For example, Promark has a thinner 5A than most. Vic Firth's 7A is shorter than most while their 8D is more like everyone's 7A.    Hold the stick as you would while playing. Let it slide through your fingers. Different manufacturers use different coatings that affect grip. Vic Firth favors a thin lacquer while Regal Tip favors a heavy lacquer, making their sticks a bit slicker and more resistant to skin oils and moisture. Promark favors a special finish that becomes tacky as your hands heat it up. Promark also offers many sticks finished only by sanding. Zildjian and Vic Firth also offer many sticks with a rubber coating offer the butt end of the stick. The only way to know what you like is to play with the sticks.  There are many brands of good drumsticks to compare, maybe you could think about your favorite artist's preference in sticks when choosing your own. Here are the top brands with some of their endorsers.   Ahead (Lars Ulrich, Rick Allen) - Ahead is favored by metal drummers due to the durability and weight of their sticks. However, many complain that the sticks hurt their hands.       ProMark (Joey Jordison, Mike Portnoy, Glenn Kotche, Benny Greb) - Promark lacks diversity in tip shapes, but offers some great finish options.       Vater (Chad Smith, David Silvera) - Vater is creates a product much like Vic Firths, but with different shapes.       Vic Firth (John Dolmayan, Vinnie Paul, Mark Guiliana) - Vic Firth offers probably the widest selection of sticks. They favor a light lacquer finish and many of their sticks are painted. ] Zildjian (Dave Grohl, Travis Barker)        , Especially if you're choosing a new kind of drumstick or a brand or size you haven't used before, ask if you can try them. Try them gently on a practice pad so that if you choose something else, the store can still sell them, but try them enough to get a feel for their weight, springiness, and balance.	Choose the right wood. Pick the right material. Choose the shape. Choose the thickness. Check the varnish or lacquer coating on the drumsticks. Choose your preferred brand. Try out the drumsticks.
Allow your plants between one and one and a half inches of water per week. Broccoli likes moist soil.   You can use a rain gauge to see how much water the plants are getting naturally, and make up the difference with irrigation. Make sure not to get the budding broccoli crowns wet when watering. Doing so causes them to mold. In particularly hot or dry conditions, increase the amount of water you feed your plants.  Use an organic, nitrogen-rich fertilizer when your broccoli plants begin to form new leaves. Fish emulsion works well for fertilizing broccoli plants. You can continue to fertilize the plants about once a week until they are ready for harvest.  Broccoli plants have very shallow roots. If you disturb the soil you may accidentally break roots and damage your broccoli plants.   If weeds develop around the plants, suffocate them with mulch instead of plucking them from the ground to avoid disturbing the roots.If you choose not to grow organically, you can also use a chemical pesticide to remove unwanted weeds from your garden without disturbing the broccoli roots.  You want to harvest your broccoli crowns when the buds are tightly closed and dark green. Avoid waiting until the buds begin to flower into light green or yellow flowers. Cut the crown where it meets the stem using garden shears.   See "Choosing a Variety" above for exact growing times for specific varieties. Avoid breaking the crown off. A clean cut will better encourage new growth. With a healthy cut, the broccoli plant should grow small shoots from the side of the stem. You can continue to harvest the small shoots, and the plant should produce more.	Water your broccoli plants regularly. Fertilize your plants about three weeks after planting. Avoid digging or turning the soil. Harvest your broccoli plants.
As a criminal defendant, you have the right to be represented by an attorney. If you don't qualify for a public defender, you should hire a private criminal defense attorney to represent you.It's important to find a defense attorney who specializes in DUI law, as they may know more about alternatives that exist. Even if you qualify for a public defender, a private defense attorney may be better able to assist you if you want alternative sentencing. Your attorney may have more information about the programs available. They also may be able to connect you with professionals and refer you to specific services.; , Your eligibility for many alternative-sentencing programs depends on your personal background, especially your criminal history. You're much more likely to qualify for alternative-sentencing programs if this is your first offense.Your attorney probably will want to pull your criminal record, but any information you can provide in the meantime will be helpful to make a preliminary analysis. You also should provide information about your work and educational history. Any other ties you have to your community also can be helpful. For example, if you are an active member of a local church, or if you coach a youth baseball or basketball team, these connections can help establish your character and your ties to the community. Often, someone who can demonstrate that they are an active and involved member of their community and have a steady employment history will have a better chance of getting into an alternative sentencing program.  The details of alternative-sentencing programs vary greatly among jurisdictions. Since there may potentially be several options from which to choose, you need to make sure the program will meet your needs.Standard programs include a combination of voluntary probation and community service. Because DUIs are strongly correlated to alcohol abuse, many jurisdictions have alternative sentencing programs available that combine some level of inpatient and outpatient addiction treatment. Treatment programs also may be combined with electronic monitoring to ensure that you are not drinking alcohol.  Once you've chosen an alternative-sentencing program that appeals to you, work with your attorney to identify reasons you would be a strong candidate for that particular program.Your attorney may have additional information about the types of offenders who typically are accepted to the various programs. With information about typical participants, you can compare their stories to your own to get a better idea of how you match up and which aspects of your history you should emphasize. Ideally, you and your attorney should look for offenders similar to you who have been successful in the alternative-sentencing program you want. Even though all people and situations are different, you have a better chance of getting into a program if you can show how your situation is similar to someone else who has used the alternative-sentencing program to get their issues with alcohol under control and has not violated the law again.  Character witnesses, such as your supervisor at work or a community leader, can be great allies for you in helping you get into an alternative-sentencing program.Keep in mind that witnesses aren't just people who were with you when you were arrested. People who know you and your character also can be strong witnesses for you. Your attorney probably will ask you for names of witnesses who might have information that would be beneficial to your defense. Be sure you have full names, addresses, and phone numbers so your attorney can get in touch with them. If you decide to start therapy with an addiction specialist, they also may be a good witness for you. They can testify to your progress and your commitment to rehabilitation.  Particularly if you know addiction counseling or driver's training will be required by the alternative-sentencing program anyway, go ahead and enroll. It can help demonstrate your commitment.Going into therapy can be beneficial for you even if you aren't able to make a plea agreement with the prosecuting attorney and end up going to trial. Making a therapy commitment sends a signal both to the prosecuting attorney and the judge that you recognize you have a problem with substance abuse and are doing everything you can to address the issue. Many jurisdictions also require anyone convicted of a DUI to attend safe driving courses. These courses are offered by the state and typically cost several hundred dollars. Taking them beforehand shows that you're serious about making a change.  If you want to negotiate a plea deal, you and your attorney will need to meet with the prosecuting attorney to go over your case. Based on their findings, the prosecuting attorney typically will have an offer for you.Particularly if this is your first offense, the prosecuting attorney may offer a better deal than alternative-sentencing programs. For example, the prosecutor may be willing to reduce your charge to reckless driving. This is particularly likely if there are problems with the evidence in your case, or if the police behaved in such a way that you potentially have an argument that they violated your constitutional rights. Your attorney will talk to you about your arrest at length before you meet with the prosecutor to ascertain if there are any possible defense arguments related to the initial traffic stop or your subsequent arrest.  If the prosecuting attorney has not offered alternative sentencing as an option for you, make sure your attorney brings it up. By asking, you can find out the reasons the prosecuting attorney did not consider alternative sentencing for you.In some situations, the prosecuting attorney will be unwilling to lower the charges from DUI. If that happens in your case, you may benefit from alternative sentencing. Particularly if it's your first offense, there may be probation options available that include a deferred sentencing option. Under deferred sentencing, if you successfully complete probation you won't even have a DUI on your record. Other alternative-sentencing options are related to treatment of alcohol abuse and addiction. This may include inpatient or outpatient addiction treatment.  The prosecuting attorney likely will have done their own research. However, you may be able to tell them information about your background that supports you as a candidate for alternative sentencing options.For example, if you've started outpatient drug rehabilitation or therapy, you may be eligible to enter a residential rehabilitation program. Other information about your employment or your role in your community also may support alternative sentencing. These details typically wouldn't have been available to the prosecuting attorney beforehand. If you have a child or other person, such as an elderly parent, who is dependent on you for support, this also can weigh in favor of alternative sentencing.  The prosecuting attorney's first offer typically isn't their last and final offer. You and your attorney can negotiate something closer to the alternative-sentencing program you have your eye on.Depending on the evidence against you, your attorney most likely will be trying to negotiate a plea bargain in which you plead guilty to a lesser charge, such as reckless driving. However, alternative sentencing programs also may come into account. Your commitment to seeking addiction treatment and taking safe driving courses may help convince the prosecuting attorney to lower the charges as well. Your attorney also may have information about various other defenses you have. Bringing this up to the prosecuting attorney may convince them that alternative sentencing is appropriate for you.  You may be able to get the prosecuting attorney to agree to recommend you for the alternative-sentencing program that you prefer. However, keep in mind this agreement is preliminary and must be approved by a judge.Accepting a plea deal typically means that you must appear in court before a judge. The prosecuting attorney will present the deal to the judge, then the judge will ask you questions. The judge wants to make sure that you understand what you are doing, and that you are pleading guilty to the charges because you are indeed guilty of the crime. Your attorney will go over the process beforehand so you're prepared and know what the judge is going to ask you, but once you stand before the judge you're on your own – your attorney cannot answer for you. However, if you are unable to get the prosecuting attorney to agree to alternative sentencing, you still have the option of arguing at trial to convince the judge that alternative sentencing is appropriate in your case.  Eligibility for many programs is based on your personal history and criminal record. To convince a judge to grant you alternative sentencing, you must first introduce evidence that you meet those eligibility requirements.In a criminal trial, although the jury will determine whether you are guilty or not guilty, the judge typically is in charge of the sentencing. Some jurisdictions have sentencing guidelines that help a judge determine the appropriate sentence, based primarily on your criminal history. If this is your first offense, you typically are automatically eligible for alternative sentencing. If the prosecuting attorney did not offer those options to you, it may have been because there were aggravating factors involved in your case. For example, if you were charged with a DUI after being involved in an auto accident in which someone else was injured, the prosecuting attorney may not be open to alternative sentencing – even if it was your first offense.  Even if you're not an ideal candidate for an alternative-sentencing program, you may be able to sway the judge by discussing the changes you've made in your life since your arrest.For example, if you have a job and family members who are dependent on your income, this can weigh in favor of alternative sentencing such as probation. Needing to maintain your job also can support your argument that any suspended license should be converted to a restricted license so that you can drive to work. If you have children or other family members who depend on you for financial support, this also may weigh in favor of alternative sentencing.  Family members, employers, and community leaders can strengthen your argument that alternative sentencing is right for you. These witnesses typically testify regarding your character and sense of responsibility.Keep in mind that your witnesses typically aren't going to be people who were with you when you were arrested for a DUI – although sometimes they might be. However, even if they were, these types of witnesses aren't going to talk about your arrest, or what you were doing before you were arrested. Rather, they're going to talk about you and who you are as a person. If you're in therapy or treatment for alcohol addition, your therapist or addiction specialist also will be a strong supporting witness for you. They can testify as to your progress in treatment and typically will tell the court that your progress would not be furthered by spending time in jail.	Talk to your attorney about alternative sentencing. Gather information about your personal history. Evaluate available programs. Build supporting arguments. Identify possible witnesses. Consider enrolling in therapy or educational courses. Meet with the prosecuting attorney. Ask about alternative sentencing options. Present information about your case. Negotiate with the prosecuting attorney. Accept a deal that meets your needs. Provide information about your background. Explain how alternative sentencing will benefit you. Call supporting witnesses.
They are often called "bone rings." You can find them in the drapery section or crochet section in a fabric store. A well-stocked craft store may also carry them.  Aim for something around 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) in diameter.  Measure the diameter of the ring. Multiply it by 21/2. Draw a circle on a sheet of cardstock with the new measurement as the diameter. Cut the circle out.If your fabric is a pattern on it, cut a circle out of the middle of your template. The circle needs to be the same size as your ring.  Spread your fabric on a flat surface, right-side-down. Place the template on top of the fabric. Trace around the circle using a tailor's chalk or pen. Cut the circle out when you are done.If your fabric has a pattern on it, make sure that the template is centered. Use the hole in the middle as a guide.  Place your fabric circle wrong-side-up on the table. Set your plastic ring down in the center. Trace around the plastic ring using a tailor's chalk or pen. Keep your line halfway between the ring and the edge of the fabric., Thread your needle and tie both ends of the thread into a knot. Start sewing on the wrong side of your fabric. Finish sewing on the right side of the fabric. Do not knot the thread when you are done.Make sure that the thread you are using is strong, preferably nylon or polyester., Place the ring on the wrong side of the fabric. Make sure that it is centered. Gently pull on the thread until the fabric gathers around the ring. Don't cut the thread yet.If your fabric has a pattern on it, check the front to make sure that it is centered. Adjust it, if needed.  Using the same needle and thread, pass the needle back through some of the gathers, anchoring them in place. Be careful not to pierce through the front of the button. Tie the thread into a knot when you are done. Don't cut it yet., Use a knitting needle or small crochet hook to tuck the raw edges of the fabric under itself and into the covered button., Make two small stitches across the back of the button. Pull on the thread to close the gap. Make two more stitches right across the first two, forming an X. Tug on them gently to further close the gap. Knot the thread, then snip it off., Thread a needle with some embroidery floss. Knot the end of the floss, then sew around the button using a straight stitch or a backstitch. Keep your stitches against the inside edge of the ring. When you are back where you started, knot the floss on the back of the button, then cut it.You can use matching or contrasting embroidery floss.  Place your button on a sheet of felt. Trace around it using a tailor's chalk or pen. Cut the circle out.The felt can be the same color as your button, or a contrasting one., Use a small whipstitch to secure the felt to the back of the button. When you are back where you started, pull the needle under the felt and out through the center-back of the button. Be careful not to pierce through the front of the button.You can use a matching thread color or a contrasting one.  Place a pen over the back of the button. Make two stitches over the pen and through the felt. Make sure that the stitches are coming out of the same spot. When you are done, slide the pen out. You should now have a loop made out of thread.You can also use a pencil, crochet hook, knitting needle, or paintbrush.  Wind the thread around the shank to make it thicker. When you are done, knot the thread to the bottom of the shank. Pull the needle and thread through the felt, and out on the other side of the shank. Snip off the excess thread. Your button is now complete!	Get a small, plastic ring. Make your template. Trace the circle onto cotton fabric, then cut it out. Sketch out your stitching guidelines. Sew a simple straight stitch around the edge of your fabric. Gather the fabric around the ring. Tack the gathers into place. Fold the raw edges of the fabric inside. Sew the gap shut. Sew around the button, just inside the ring. Cut a circle out of felt. Stitch the felt to the back of the button. Make the shank. Reinforce the shank.
Play at different speeds: slow, medium and fast. Use a metronome and practice scales with different beat durations or tempos. Instead of playing through the beat continuously, try a stop-and-go method.For instance, play three notes, pause, play three more notes, pause again, and continue this variation.  Instead of just playing the same piece repeatedly in the same way, try new ways of playing it.Change octaves. Practice with your eyes closed sometimes. Alternate playing softly and loudly. Try practicing while you bounce, dance, wiggle your head, or beatbox.Explore other practice methods, such as chaining. With chaining, you play small units at tempo and slowly build longer chains of units. Start with a small passage and add a measure each time you master a small unit., Play a piece completely through the first time and mark down the places where you ran into difficulty. Take those portions out and practice them separately. Isolating and repeating difficult music passages can help you to master a piece of music.   Instead of getting discouraged when you reach parts that cause you stumble, you extract them and give them hyper-focus until you can play them as well as the rest of the piece., Each day of practicing should at least include a block of playing scales as well as a block of time focused on building technical skills.Repeat one activity (or "block") acceptably before moving on to the next. This encourages comfort with the activity and prompts muscle memory to kick in.For example, spend the first block of time warming up, the second block on a difficult piece of music, the third on proper finger placement, and the fourth on some smaller pieces you have already practiced before.Another approach is to time each block. For example, spend 10 minutes on scales. Even if you don’t get it perfect by the end of that time, move on to the next block. Otherwise, getting stuck can be frustrating.  A good way to do this is to place three objects, such as coins or beads, in front of you (on your music stand, if possible). When you play a challenging measure correctly, move one object to the right. If you play the measure through successfully again, move another object to the right. If you stumble with the notes or rhythm, return all of the objects to the left. You have to play the measure through without errors three times in a row in order to move all of the objects to the right-hand side.Once all of your coins or beads are to the right, you can connect the difficult measure to the measures surrounding it, and then to the rest of the music.  Make flashcards with musical tasks in four groups: warmups, technical methods, difficult or long songs, and easy or short songs. You can list specific songs, scales or chords on the flashcards, or write in general terms such as genres or octaves. Alternate your practice session with “surprise” flash card days. Choose one flashcard at random from each group to determine which musical pieces you will practice that day.   Roll dice: whatever number you get is how many times you will play a measure or a song.Try incorporating your practice into a board game. Keep a board game designated for instrument practice in your music area. Each time you master a piece of music or a technique, move up a space on the game board and write down what you achieved.	Change your timing. Use different practice techniques. Isolate trouble spots. Break practice sessions into blocks. Use visible benchmarks to master difficult measures. Make practice into a game.
If you primarily seek durability, saddle blanket seat covers are known for being tough, so your money goes a long way. If you want seat covers that can be thrown in the washing machine in the event of stains, a polyester-cotton blend may be best.  The color can be different from the shade of your original car seats, but it should complement the exterior of your car. Keep in mind that lighter covers tend to show stains easily, while black covers may feel particularly hot on warm days.  This is an ideal way to show some personality in your car. For example, a Hawaiian pattern can display your fun side, while camouflage can provide your car with a masculine look.	Select a fabric for your car seat covers that best meets your needs. Pick a color. Consider fabrics with patterns or designs.
Trace your hand with a pencil on plain white paper. Cut the handprint out with scissors. You can also wait until you’ve painted the handprints to cut them out. Repeat this until you have about 10-12 handprints.10-12 handprints is a good amount, but you can cut out as many as you’d like.; , Acrylic paint, or any type of paint that is made for kids, will work. Choose 3 or 4 colors. Purple, pink, red, and yellow work well together. Use a paintbrush to paint each handprint that you cut out.Keep a cup of water beside you to wash the paintbrush as you switch colors.  Once the paint has dried, use glue or cellotape to attach the handprints to straws. Any type of plastic or paper straws will work. Cut the bottom of the straws to vary the lengths so that they look better once arranged in the flower pot.You can use regular Elmer’s white glue to attach the handprints to straws.  You can use any flower pot. Arrange the handprint flowers in the flower pot. Place some Play-Doh or Blue-Tac at the bottom of the straws to weigh the flowers down in the pot. Fill the pot about halfway with strips of tissue paper once you are satisfied with the flower arrangement.You can add or take away handprints until you are satisfied with the outcome.	Trace and cut out handprints. Paint the handprints. Attach handprints to straws. Put the hand print flowers in a flower pot.
This should be as clean as possible with little or no background noise.       Sound Effects/Foley. Sound effects like traffic and animal sounds can either be recorded or found in libraries which are used in feature films, though these must be purchased for royalty-free use. Foley effects, such as footsteps and the rustle of clothes, are best recorded yourself using a condenser microphone.       Tempo music. This is music which is used by editors to set a pace but is not used in the final mix.       Atmosphere. This is the background sound to a scene such as in a wood it might be the rustle of trees and birdsong, it is used to give continuity to a scene which may have been filmed in different locations. ,, You monitor sound through speakers and headphones, using meters as a reference. Use flat equalization and keep the volume the same the whole time you do the mix to ensure a consistent volume no matter how many tracks are being mixed. Make sure to turn off any equalizers, bass boost, or other enhancements that may be available on the monitoring system.; , Avoid using cheap computer speakers and instead use a high quality stereo and amplifier with the equalizer set to flat.  The lack of ambient sound, coupled with the extreme stereo field, creates an unrealistic monitoring environment that often doesn't translate to larger systems.   Mixing solely using headphones is usually avoided, but you can use them if you keep in mind that it sounds different from speakers as sound is not bouncing off surfaces, you will hear more distinction between left and right and you may pick up some sounds you don't hear on speakers. You could probably mix 90% of the time with a good pair of headphones, but you will at some point have to hear your mix through speakers.  The sound editing tools found in Final Cut Pro, Premier and Avid will do basic effects but can't be relied on for anything complex.  These are your best options as they include advanced features to help in cleaning up sound but it is a steep learning curve.    Levels vs volume. Levels and volume differ in that if you turn the volume down your levels still bounce around. Levels are the objective levels of sound at which the audio has been or is being recorded. Levels vs loudness. Levels and loudness differ with loudness being a measurement of average voltage signal. Low frequencies could appear high on the meters but be barely audible to the hear, having a lower loudness. Likewise compressed sound may not seem high on meters but sound loud to the ear, and is used frequently on narration. Levels vs Decibels. Numbers on a meter are not decibels; they vary according to the type of meter.  There are two types of analogue meters (that use needles): a volume unit which can give you a good rough idea and is cheaper but less sensitive, than the peak program meter which provides more accurate readings and needle falls more slowly. Peak on these is between 4 and 5 and is more forgiving taking full volume to make this happen. Digital. You are more likely to use a digital meter, which is extremely accurate, but beware that digital sound is unforgiving when it comes to clip distortion when the level goes into the red. Digital audio should never exceed 0 dBFS on a digital meter.  Don't edit the video once you have started mixing the audio.  Keep levels consistent. This should be roughly around -12dB, but some parts may be slightly quieter.  With DSLRs more and more people are recording sound separately to the video. You can sync either manually by using a clapper board or using a piece of software such as Plural Eyes or Woo Wave which do it automatically.   Scene by scene. Work on one scene at a time, and work through each element separately. Atmosphere. Start by laying atmosphere tracks down; these should be continuous throughout. Prioritize. For each scene work out whether dialogue, special effects or music or sound fx is most important and mix this level first. Spotting. Go through the scene writing down what other sounds you need to find in a library or record. Play around. When you have mixed it so it is all at a constant level and feels continuous, you should think of the tonal quality of the sound.. For example the music and dialogue may be a similar pitch so they are clashing.  Note: Don't attempt extreme stereo effects or surround sound unless you are an experienced sound mixer with expensive equipment. It's best to stick with stereo or mono. When mixing keep your music as stereo and atmosphere as stereo but pan the rest so that they are central. If you have two characters talking to each other you could pan one to one side and the other to the other side, but don't go further than 50%.  Documentaries rely solely on sound in the form of interviews and narration to tell a story. It is very unusual to re-record anything in post so you have to record it well on set and do what you can to sweeten it in post. There may be fewer tracks in a documentary, but do not underestimate how long it takes to mix due to the sound problems you must deal with due to the guerrilla nature of a documentary.  Atmosphere. Ambient sound recorded on set is the first thing you lay down to smooth edits and may help if you are having problems with background sound. If you are clever you can create a sort of soundtrack from the atmosphere tracks.       Narration and interviews. You will want to have these as clean as possible, though you can do a little to improve them. In the worst case of sound that is poorly understood, add subtitles.       Music is a powerful tool in documentaries, but don't over use it. Remember silence can bring great tension.  You can also use it to show when a character's attention wanders by reducing the level of other voices.  Semi-detached. Sound off screen can create an enigma or cover an effect you couldn't afford to do visually on your budget.       Silence. Remember not to drown your audience out with sound, as silence is just as important and can be useful for tension when there is a sudden sound.  This is not a filter but is useful to put at the end of a track of audio to avoid pops. Echo/Reverb. You use this effect if you did not pick it up on location and for psychological effects.  Ask yourself how long a sound carries on in a location. For example if you clap your hands in a church then outside, the sound will seem to last longer in the church. This filter is used to match sounds you might have gotten from a library or recorded somewhere else to the location.   Equalizer. Think of it as a frequency specific volume controller. You use this to make different frequencies louder or quieter. It can be used to emphasize a voice and balance a recording. For example you may have recorded someone playing a piano but in the recording you mostly pick up the treble notes. Using the equalizer you can bring in more of the bass and mid-range notes. An equalizer can also be used if you just want the bass of the music, such as if the characters are outside a club. Here you would cut (lower) the high frequencies to create a realistic sound. Compression/Normalization. Dialogue varies in volume so a compressor is used to smooth out the loud bits which makes the dialogue seem closer and more intimate. This effect is used extensively on narration and whispering dialogue. Normalization is more harsh than a compressor and should not be used, unless the audio levels are too low to achieve the proper loudness even with compression. Notch filter. Notch filters are essentially equalizers set to remove specific problematic frequencies. You can get rid of continuous sounds such as fridge, camera, hum.  This helps you eliminate rumble and sounds such as unwanted footsteps, traffic and wind. Set it to roughly around 80 Hz.   Expander/noise gate. This filter softens noise below a certain level so as to remove some background sound. Noise removal. This filter is available in Soundtrack Pro and works by you selecting a quiet part of a clip with bad hiss or background sound then it will work on the whole clip. This filter produces varying results. Keyframes. Key frames is another way of making sound constant throughout a clip. Note: It is smart to listen to your sound on a wide range of devices before you master your film to see if any issues crop up.	Consider the different types of soundtrack:  Dialogue. Think about sounds before shoot, what can you record on set?  , Record good sound on set.  , Keep your volume level even or at the same level. Use good quality speakers. Keep in mind that headphones will result in a different sound than using speakers will. Choose a good editing suite. Choose a good sound mixing software such as Pro Tools, Soundtrack Pro, or Cubase. Consider the differences between levels, volume and loudness (and even decibels). Differentiate between and understand the two main metering types:   Analogue. Lock the picture. Remember that levels are additive so the more sounds you put in the timeline the higher your levels will be. Keep all of your devices synchronized with your DSLR. Approach documentaries in a slightly different way than narrative films. Use sound to draw attention to an object or person. Understand your basic filtering options:   Dissolve/Fade Out. Add some reverberation to the soundtrack of the film. Use a "High pass" setting in your audio to the film.
The best way to do this is by turning off the electricity supplied to the circuit on which you will be working at the junction box (also called a fuse box) for your home. Switch the breaker of your fuse-box so the fuse for the circuit supplying electricity to your fixture reads "Off."It's always a good idea to double-check the flow of electricity by checking the light itself before moving forward with this project. Flick the light on, and if the circuit has been disabled, the light should stay off.; , If the light you are wiring is in the ceiling, you should clean any cobwebs and dust before attempting to install your new fixture. The same is true for lights or switches in walls; a clean work area will improve your ease of installation.   If you are using a ladder to reach your light fixture, or are in a less than ideal position, be sure the ground is also clear of debris or anything else that might affect your balance or safety.  There is usually, but not always, a decorative globe, shield, or some kind of external feature covering your existing light fixture. This could also be something more involved, like ceiling fan blades., There will be a mounting bracket holding your old fixture in place. You will need to unscrew this from mounting bracket, usually with Phillips-head screwdriver, and then pull it from the bracket.   Be sure you support the old fixture with your hand as you unscrew it from the mount. If you do not support the fixture, it could fall to the floor once you loosen the screws holding it in.  Allow the unscrewed fixture you are supporting with your hand to descend a few inches below its mount. You will likely see three wires attached to your fixture: a hot wire, grounding wire, and neutral wire. You will need to use your free hand to uncouple these wires, twisting the wiring cap to free the wires from each other.   Hot wires are those that run electricity to your fixtures and grounding wires are intended to offer surge electricity a neutral point, like the earth, into which it can dissipate.In some cases, a grounding wire might be attached to the mounting bracket itself, rather than a house wire. This is fairly common in new light fixtures.  You should see plastic caps, called wiring caps (also called a wire nut), with two wires running into each cap. One wire will come from the light, the other from the main electrical circuit of your house. Disengage the wires by twisting the wiring cap until it comes free.Once you have released the light from its wiring, you can set the existing light fixture aside.  In most cases, the mounting hardware for your new fixture will fit the bracket that's already installed.You'll need to hold the new light fixture up to the existing mounting bracket and compare fasteners and size to make sure you don't need to install a new mounting bracket.  Oftentimes, if a light requires a special bracket, this will be included with the light you have bought. If not, you can look up the light information online by doing a general search of the name of the light fixture, which you can find on the box. Listed with its information should be mounting information as well.   Once you know the kind of bracket you need, you can find and purchase it at your local hardware store. Replacing the old bracket is just a matter of unscrewing it and screwing the new one into place.  This is especially important if you have an older home, in particular, any home built before 1985. Wiring installed prior to 1985 has weaker insulation than contemporary circuits, meaning the heat generated by your fixture could cause a short, fire, or worse.   Fixtures unsafe to use for older wiring will have a warning label that says, “Use wire rated for at least 90 degrees C.” Fixtures without this warning will still be suitable for your pre-1985 wiring., Depending on your country, the colors that code which wires are live, ground, and neutral may differ. In any case, you should support your new light with one hand and take each like colored wire coming from your wall or ceiling and combine it with its mate coming from the light fixture. Twist the exposed ends of the wire together, and seal it by screwing on a wiring cap. A general guide to electrical wiring color code is as follows:CA:Live - black (single phase), red (with a second hot wire)Neutral - whiteEarth/ground - green, green and yellow, or bare copper  UK:Live - brown, black, or redNeutral - blueEarth/ground - green and yellow  USA:Live - black (single phase), red (with second hot wire)Neutral - whiteEarth/ground - green, green and yellow, or bare copper, If there is a remaining wire that is green, green and yellow, or bare copper, you should screw it into place on the mounting hardware for your light fixture. There will likely be a small screw for this purpose on the fixture, which you can unscrew slightly, slot the wire into the gap between screw and fixture, and then tighten to fasten your ground.Be sure your ground wire feeds to a place it can safely disperse an electrical current. Many metal surfaces can be suitable for this purpose.  Continuing to support your fixture with your hand, hold it in place so as to line up the screw holes with those of the bracket and screw it into the mount using the hardware that came with the fixture.  There may be external features or parts, like a light cover or ceiling fan blades, to add to your new light fixture. Take a moment to step back and inspect your fixture for levelness, orientation, and flushness with the surface on which you've installed it. Some light fixtures are permanently angled a certain way, and improper installation can lead to your light shining where it does little good.  Return to your fuse-box and reset the fuse for the room in which you've been wiring to restore the flow of electricity to the room. Now you can install a light bulb and turn on the new light fixture you have installed to test it out., Sometimes, over the course of installation, a wire might be jostled or damaged in such a way as to compromise its ability to transmit electricity to your new light. Additionally, in some cases, contractors may have used different colored wires for your electrical setup. In both of these cases you should use a circuit tester to ensure you don't make a dangerous mistake with your wiring.   A circuit tester can be purchased at most hardware stores. Turn off the electricity, free the wire you are uncertain about from the old fixture, and then turn the electricity back on, being sure that your free wire is not touching anything dangerous. Your circuit tester will have two nodes; connect one to the questionable wire and the other to a grounded, metal surface or your ground wire. If the light on your tester turns on, the wire is hot and is supplied with electricity., Some wiring jobs are done haphazardly, with poorly managed wire in the fixture box or wall or ceiling where you are working. After turning off the circuit, hold up your fixture to your mount to approximate how much wire you will need.   Be sure to leave some excess. Wire can become damaged or get brittle over time, in which case, you might want to strip some insulation off the wire to tie a new fixture in to your circuit.  If you are working with older wire, or if the stripped part of the wire is difficult to work with, after you have cut power to the circuit you are working on, you can strip more wire for greater ease of handling.   It is recommended that you remove about ½" of wire insulation with a wire stripper or a utility knife. Be sure you exercise care when using a utility knife; you don't want to nick or damage the metal part of your wire., If you have a friend of family member available to assist, it can help a great deal to have this person hold the fixture while you're wiring. If you do not have help available, you can bend a piece of unused scrap wire to hang the light securely from the mount. With the fixture secured, you should be able to use both hands, making the wiring portion a cinch.An assistant is especially helpful when you are wiring a ceiling light. While you are on a ladder or chair, your helper can hold you steady, hand you tools and parts, and take unneeded parts from you as you finish.	Cut power to your circuit. Clean the old fixture and installation area. Remove the old fixture covering. Unmount the fixture. Lower the fixture. Disengage your light from its wires. Check for compatibility. Swap in a new bracket, if necessary. Investigate the age of your wiring. Join like colored wires. Ground your fixture. Fasten your fixture in the mounting bracket. Finish any supplemental installation. Test your new light. Test for electrical current. Create space to work. Give yourself more wire. Give yourself another hand while wiring.
If you'd like the blanket to be double-sided, cut two pieces of fleece instead: one that is solid-colored, and one that is patterned.  Trace the corners first using a pen, then cut the corners out using a sharp pair of scissors.Not only does this give your blanket a unique touch, but you won't have to sew Mildred corners when adding the bias tape.   You can also use a plate or a lid.  Unless you made your own bias tape, or bought it already the right length, you will have to sew two or more lengths of bias tape together to make one long, continuous strand.Open up both ends of the bias tape, then pin them together, with the wrong sides facing out. Sew the two strands together using a ¼-inch (0.64-centimeter) seam allowance.  Nestle the raw edge of the blanket right into the fold of the bias tape. Place a sewing pin ever 3 inches (7.62 centimeters)., Trim off the excess bias tape until you have about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) left. Overlap it by ½ inch (1.27 centimeters), then fold the excess under itself. Press it flat with an iron, then pin it in place.  Remove the pins as you sew.  Go over your blanket and double-check for any missed pins, then carefully trim off any loose threads. Your blanket is now complete, and ready to use!	Cut a 36 by 36-inch (91.44 by 91.44-centimeter) piece of fleece. Use a bowl to trace and cut rounded edges onto the corners of your blanket. Sew the bias tape together, if needed. Pin the bias tape all the way around the edge of the blanket. Fold the end of the bias tape under itself to conceal the raw edge. Sew around the bias tape, using a ⅛-inch (0.32-centimeter) seam allowance.Use a thread color that matches the bias tape. Finish the blanket.
Give your audience the feeling of being let in on a secret, whilst also giving you a way to vent.  You can also write them both at the same time, which can be much easier. Whichever you write second is likely to be harder because you have to fit it to the other part you wrote, so save your particular talent until second.   Some pretty well-know artists start with the melody, and then find the right words to fit. There's one song everybody knows that started out with only a melody. As the song was developed, the artist sang "Scrambled eggs..." When he was finished, Paul McCartney had written "Yesterday." This is also a favorite technique of Peter Gabriel, who frequently uses nonsense syllables as he works out the melody, adding actual words only when the music has been decided on.  Write as many ideas down as possible and words that relate to it (especially useful if you want to make your lyrics rhyme). Write as much detail as possible—remember it might not all go into your final lyrics. Express yourself!  , Sing it to yourself to make sure that the rhythm and words are together.  The Arctic Monkeys have managed to rhyme "something" with "stomach" (summat, stomach).   While making words with different endings rhyme, and making dissimilar words flow is a definite plus, do not overdo this. You can use regional sayings or phrases. This tends to make the piece sound native to a specific area. Also, a common thing for British bands is to use the accent to their advantage—like South Central Heroes—and this can create a very unique beat. However, there is no need to fake an accent or dialect just to make your song sound "unique."  , Maybe you could have lots of repeated lines, an unconventional rhyming scheme or a range of very short and very long lines.  Pay attention to how people around you talk and what they talk about. You could base your lyrics around this.  Make your song deeper and more interesting by using similes, metaphors and other literary devices.  Include things that are funny or make references to current affairs and trends as people tend to remember them more. They also tend to date a song, and what began as a serious song can be seen as dated or even campy a few years down the line.  Make sure it is relevant to your lyrics, but if it's only tangentially related, or just downright obscure, don't worry too much about it. Dylan's Rainy Day Women No. 12 and 35 means absolutely nothing to mere mortals (and perhaps not even to Mr. Dylan), but when he wrote that song, Everybody Must Get Stoned was not a title that would get any airplay or juke box positioning.   Be careful of overly-long names, like Joan Miro's Procession Through The Insides Of A Purple Antelope Across A Sea Of Tuna Fish by Adrian Belew. If you make your song name really long, people will either gloss over it (bad), make up their own name for it (risky), or it'll become a cult favorite simply because of the name. If the muse moves you to it, follow your muse.	Make your song deeply personal. Decide how you want to write your song: tune first or lyrics first. List things that you might want to say in your lyrics. Start with the chorus. Write in accent and dialect, but keep it natural. Think of an unusual rhythm for your lyrics. Listen carefully. Be literary. Be humorous. Create a thought-provoking title.
These situations are more likely to erupt into violence, so it is best to stay away from them.   If you spot a crowd of people, turn away and take a different route to your destination.  Police scanner apps can helpful during times of civil unrest.You can download a police scanner app and listen to it to determine what areas of your city you should avoid. This can be especially helpful if you need to go out or if you are trying to find the safest way out of the city.   Check the app before you download it to make sure that it is compatible with police scanners in your country.  If you need to leave your home to purchase something necessary, such as food, then make sure that you only carry enough cash to make the purchase.Don’t bring all of your credit cards along with you when you go out.   If you do not have any cash, then you may want to try to get to an ATM as soon as possible to withdraw some of your money.  A knife that you can easily conceal or some pepper spray is a good option.   Try to avoid or deescalate a potential conflict before getting out your knife or pepper spray; the presence of a weapon may cause increased aggression.	Steer clear of heavily populated areas and crowds.Avoid demonstrations, rallies, and other situations where lots of people might be present. Download a police scanner app. Carry limited cash. Arm yourself with a knife or pepper spray.If you are concerned about your safety, then you may want to carry some form of protection when you go out.
The type you can get from a dollar store or a craft store are ideal. It needs to be tall enough to hang your bracelets from., Try to find a dowel thick enough to cover the hole in your candlestick. You may need to cut it down to the right length.If you can't find a wooden dowel, stuff a rolled up magazine into a paper towel tube, and use that instead.  Measure across the dowel with a ruler, and make a mark in the center. Don't worry, you don't see the mark once you are done painting.  Make sure the line is going from side to side. The candle hole will interrupt your line. You can use wood glue, tacky glue, or an industrial strength glue for this.  Make sure that the mark you made earlier is right in the middle of the candle hole. Try to center the dowel on top of the candlestick as much as possible. If you see any excess glue, wipe it off quickly with a damp paper towel.  Once the glue dries, you can strengthen your holder by filling the seam between the dowel and the candlestick with more glue.  Take the bracelet holder to a well-ventilated area and protect your work surface with newspaper. Shake a can of spray paint, hold it 6 to 8 inches (15.24 to 20.32 centimeters) away from the holder, and spray on a light, even coat. Wait for the coat to dry, then apply a second one, if necessary. Most spray paints will dry in 20 minutes to 2 hours.   It is better to apply your paint in many thin coats rather than one thick coat. This will give you a smoother finish and prevent any drips or puddles. You can also prime your holder first using a spray on primer. Choose white for a light color, and black or grey for a dark color.  Once the paint dries, shake a can of some acrylic sealer, hold it 6 to 8 inches (15.24 to 20.32 centimeters) away from the holder, and spray on a light, even coat. Wait for the sealer to dry, then apply a second coat. Avoid applying the sealer too thickly, or you will get drips and puddles. Most sealers will take about 2 hours to dry; some will also require a curing time, which will be specified on the can.   Choose a glossy finish if you want your holder to be shiny. Choose a matte finish if you don't want it to be shiny.  Once your holder dries, it is ready to go. You can leave it as it is, or embellish it further to better match your room decor. You can use hot glue or super glue to attach these embellishments. Here are some ideas to get you started:   Glue a pretty button or bead to each end of the dowel. Try to choose a bead or button that is the same diameter. Glue some small pearls, beads, or silk flowers around the top edge of the candlestick. Glue a large bead or ornament on top of the holder, right in the center. Wrap ribbon around the dowel in a spiral.	Choose a wooden candlestick. Choose a thick, wooden dowel that is about 10 to 12 inches (25.4 to 30.48 centimeters) long. Find the center of the dowel and mark it with a pen or pencil. Draw a line of glue across the top center of the candlestick. Press the dowel down into the glue. Wait for the glue to dry. Spray paint the bracelet holder. Spray the holder with an acrylic sealer and let it dry. Consider embellishing your holder.
One vital step is to make sure the phone and case are the right fit. One of the only ways to do this is to bring your phone along with you and “test drive” cases/purses you like.  You want to check out the coin purse and wallet area for your purchase.  Just because you have a certain design or style in mind doesn’t mean that you can’t change if you see something else. Be open to new devices for the phone pursue such as using a small draw sting bag or even a wallet.  Be mindful of how much money you are spending on the purse, even if money is no object. Look for discounts or markdowns--also consider shopping at a retail outlet.  Even though you may intend to carry the iPhone purse in your briefcase, try it out in the event the particular case you chose doesn’t fit or doesn’t look good.	Bring your iPhone along for the shopping trip. Head to the purse section of the retail store. Keep an open mind about what you will buy. Consider price. Test how you will carry the purse.
Go to the craft store keeping in mind the kind of sewing projects that your friend likes to do and the colors that he or she uses. Choose some of the following items to place in the sewing kit:  10 or more unique matching buttons. Paper flowers or crocheted flowers. Spools of attractive ribbons. Spools of colorful thread. Striped twine. Creative masking tape or stickers. Grid paper that can be cut into circles or shapes. Needles, a small pincushion and pins.  Then consider the rest of the sewing kit and decide how to attractively fit all of the contents in the jar. Place the needles and pins near the bottom so that they do not hurt anyone during transportation., If it does not fit, you can simply use the pincushion as the lid. If not, place a piece of fabric over the top and tie it on with striped twine., Your crafty friend will appreciate that these sometimes expensive items can now be part of her craft stash.	Empty and clean a large glass jar, such as a large jam jar or a ketchup bottle. Wrap the spools of ribbon around wooden clothespins to help them fit into the glass jar better. Stick the pincushion on top and screw the top on the jar. Make a label that says something like "Kimberley's Sewing Kit," and glue it to the jar or tie it to the top.
Instead of haphazardly throwing a bunch of filling into the tube, thinking about how you want the necklace to appear and what look you hope to achieve. Perhaps draw the design on paper.  This should be done based on personal preference and overall fashion goals.   Use other necklaces to help you determine the length of your necklace. While other necklaces won’t lay the same way, using other pieces of jewelry as your guide can give you somewhat of an idea of how long you’d like the tubing to be. Remember that plastic tubing does not lay the same way as chains or pearls so keep that in mind when styling longer necklaces.  Slide the thin, metal nail through the top of the cord end with the head portion facing the bottom.   Cut the thin metal nail approximately 1 inch (2.5cm) from the top once it’s fully threaded through the cord end. Use wire cutters if your scissors can’t cut through the metal. Bend the metal nail backward and into the top of the cord end so you create a loop.  This will provide a barrier at the end and prepare the tube for filling.   Allow the glued cord end ample amount of time to dry before filling. If it is still wet, the cord end could become unglued after being filled, creating a mess.  This may take some time as you will want to be neat and tidy when adding glitter or stones.   Consider using a small funnel to guide filling neatly into the plastic tubing. If you don’t own a small funnel, simply create one from a piece of paper by rolling it sideways and then placing the smaller end into the top of the tube.  This time you may want to add a clasp. The easiest way to add the clasp is to slide it through the cord end loop as you create it. Before you bend the thin metal nail backwards to create the loop, slide the clasp through the nail and then bend the nail into the loop.	Visualize how the necklace will look when you are finished. Cut the tubing to desired size. Create the cord end loop if it does not come pre-looped. Glue the cord end on one side of the plastic tubing. Fill the necklace with desired pieces. Close the open end with another cord end. Finished.
This ensures waste water won't freeze in the tanks. Follow up with a sewer hose rinse to prevent existing solid and liquid waste from solidifying in the hose.  An open gray water valve enables overnight waste to flow into the septic system instead of filling up your tanks. Closing the black water valve prevents excessive odors.  This is to allow for a slow, steady drip of water and ensures water won't freeze because it's moving through the supply lines at all times. Avoid wasting water--wait until bedtime to leave faucets open.	Empty your gray and black water holding tanks. Leave the valve open for your RV grey water tank, but close the black water valve. Open your kitchen and bathroom faucets. Ensure all sink drains are open to avoid a flood.
All lawns have an ideal grass height that promotes healthy growth. Depending on climate and geography, your ideal grass height is between 1/4 inch (0.635 cm) and 3 inches (7.62 cm).   Talk to a landscaping expert or a professional at your local home and garden retailer to get an understanding of the type of grass you have and how high it should grow. Keep grass a little bit longer when in doubt. This will provide shade to your lawn, depriving potential weeds of sunlight.; , This will eliminate weed heads before they are allowed to mature or germinate in your lawn.   Use a weed whacker or a trimmer on the weeds that grow at the edge of your lawn every time you mow.  The cover will keep the ground cool and deprived of sunlight, discouraging the growth of new weeds.	Determine the ideal height of your grass. Mow your lawn as regularly as necessary to keep grass at its ideal height. Spread stones or mulch around your flower beds to prevent weeds from growing.
The different plant habits are upright, mounding, and trailing. You can use all three types of plants in your container.   One idea is to use a tall plant in the middle for the focal point, mounding plants to put around the focal point, and trailing plants to hang over the edges.Other terms used are “thriller,” “filler,” and “spiller.” Thrillers refer to the upright habits, fillers, refer to the mounding, and spiller refers to the trailing plants.  You could put plants together that are all somewhat similar in size. You could also group plants together in a range of sizes that complement one another. For example, tall sunflowers could be in the same container with medium-height zinnias and small daises. You could use filler like baby's breath to round out the variety.  Be creative and don’t be afraid to use plants of a variety of textures for the fillers and spillers. This will generally make the design look more natural and less contrived. For example, sweet potato vine is leafy and bright, creating a thick texture. You could contrast this with a brightly colored thriller, such as a bird of paradise. Ornamental grasses are also a good choice; they come in many different sizes, colors, and growth habits.  Try planting a variety of herbs, since they have different textures, grow well together, look attractive and all share a similar function. You could also arrange different kinds of flowers in containers. Choose flowers with a variety of petal colors -- they could complement (or contrast) with one another.   For example, you could group a variety of herbs like lavender, thyme, basil, catnip and rosemary together. If you wanted to try something visually appealing with flowers, try a few different types of blooms in a range of shades. For instance, for a purple theme, you could plant violets, purple pansies, irises, bell heather, verbena and lavender.	Arrange plants according to their “habit.” There are different ways to organize the plants within each container, usually according to size and habit. Arrange plants according to their size. Experiment with different textures. Arrange plants by function or color.
For most guitarists, the easiest way to do this is with a guitar tuner. These devices are available at most music stores. Set your tuner according to the string you are tuning, play that string, and the tuner will indicate whether you are sharp or flat. Adjust the tuning peg by twisting it to raise flat notes and lower sharp notes until your tuner indicates the note is in tune.   You can also use a tuning fork, a pitch pipe, or some other instrument that is already in tune to tune your guitar. Play the instrument of each string and tune the strings one at a time until they are perfectly in tune with the note played by the tuning fork, pitch pipe, or tuned instrument.; , In reggae, the strumming generally is on the offbeat. The offbeat is on the "and" that occurs in between the beats of a 4:4 time signature song. So if you're counting the beats "1... 2... 3... 4," imagine an "and" in between each main beat. This is the offbeat.   A simple reggae strum pattern uses a down-strum on the "and" like "1 (and) 2 (and) 3 (and) 4 (and) 1..." Your first strum should be a down-strum.There are some exceptions to the "play on the offbeat" rule. Music is largely about conveying a sense of feeling or getting into a groove. The strumming of the strings is referred to by many different names in reggae. Some call it a "chop," "skank," or "bang.", This is the second most common strum pattern in reggae music. Once you down-strum on the offbeat, draw your hand back across the strings upwards in an up-strum.   Once you are more experienced with reggae, you may be able to alternate between playing down-strums and down-up strums, but while learning it may be easiest to stick with one at a time. Another common strum pattern is to single strum on the first offbeat and then do a down-up strum on the second offbeat., Use firm pressure with your left hand on the fretboard to lessen the sound produced in the strings while strumming. This will create a quality of sound that's called "chicken scratch" in funk music.By muting the strings and focusing on the strum pattern, it's likely you'll pick up the groove of reggae music more quickly.  Pick one of your favorite reggae songs and listen to it to get a feel for the rhythm. Then play the song a second time, only this time strum in time with the chords that are played in the recording. Don't worry if you don't know the chords that are being played. This exercise is just to help you get a feel for the rhythm.Again, you may find it easiest to strum along with the song you have chosen by muting the strings with firm pressure in your left hand across the fretboard. This way, you won't be distracted by the sound and can focus on matching the rhythm.  Now that you've gotten the hang of the basic strum patters reggae, you can start working on getting the right sound out of your strings. This requires the right amount of pressure on the strings on the fretboard with your left hand. To get a feel for the effect your left hand pressure has on the sound of your guitar, play chords in reggae rhythm and adjust the pressure in your left hand as you play.Try playing chords with while using extremely light pressure, moderate pressure, heavy pressure with your left hand on the strings. Your left hand affects the sound of the strum of your chords not just by pressure on the strings but also duration. While using different levels of pressure, experiment with pressure duration. For example, you might use moderate pressure at the onset followed by the release of your left hand.  Staccato is a musical term that means notes are played in a clipped, detached fashion from other notes. This quality can be produced by applying quick pressure to the strings with your left hand followed immediately by a sudden release., In reggae, the stuck line is the guitar part that follows along with the bass guitar. This part is generally muted to give a mellow tone to the acoustic accompaniment of the bass.Use moderate pressure with your left hand on your fretboard when playing the stuck line.  Finger pick the notes of the stuck line to create a distinct sound in the notes.  Try to do this especially with bar chords that extend across the entire fret, like A major. Bar chords are where your finger covers the entire fret. Keep your playing arm loose and swing it down to strum your hand over all strings, from the first to the last.Many times, beginning guitarists will approach the strings on an angle with their right hand. This kind of technique can lead to missed strings in the strum. You can play reggae with a three or four string strum, but using all five is recommended. This will give you a fuller sound in your playing. The rhythm of the music is more important than hitting all the strings. As the rhythm becomes easier, you can shift your focus to hitting all the strings., If you play your guitar stiffly, you'll probably notice the sound of your guitar reflect this, causing your guitar to sound too mechanical and stiff for reggae. Try to get into the groove of the music by swaying gently or bobbing along with the rhythm.Your guitar should bounce slightly with your left hand as you push the sound out by drawing your right hand across the strings.  You can use both major and minor chords as you practice. You should choose chords and chord progressions that fit with the song you are trying to play. For example, you might try a 3-chord progression of the main chords of the song you are practicing.At first, look through the music and pick chords that come easy to you and sound the best together. Then try linking these with more difficult chords. Take your time connecting the chords together slowly and fluidly. This is a good opportunity for you to practice and learn the song inside and out. Once you are more comfortable, choose more complex chords and variations to put your own flavor on the sound.  Some well known reggae musicians you might want to listen to include Bob Marley and the Wailers, Prince Buster, and Jackie Mittoo. Note how these performers play their songs and try to emulate it.   You can look up the chords or the tabs for many of the songs played by professional musicians online. This way you don't have to guess at which chord is being played.	Tune your guitar. Play the chords of your reggae song on the off beats. Use a down-up stroke on the offbeat. Mute the strings and practice strumming. Strum along with a song. Adjust the pressure while strumming. Make your notes staccato. Mute the stuck line when playing in an ensemble. Strum in a harmonic, percussive fashion. Groove with the rhythm of the music. Alternate your chords. Imitate the reggae masters.
You'll be able to come up with more interesting and varied notes for your solo if you base your solo off chords. Chords change much more frequently throughout a song than keys, meaning your chord based solo will likely have a greater variety of notes than a key based one.You may want to go through your song and write the chords for each bar of music if this information isn't already there.  Now that your chords are written out, you can play scales or arpeggios in the key of those chords to create a complementary sounding solo. When the chord changes, change the scale or arpeggio you are playing to match the key of the new chord.Keys with the same number accidentals or keys different by only a single accidental on the Circle of Fifths are generally harmonious., You can think of the root of a chord as its most central tone. By playing the root of the chord throughout your solo, weaving it into scales, arpeggios, and more, your solo will sound more tonally centered and harmonic.The letter name of each chord generally indicates its root. For example, a Gmaj7 chord has a root of G, an F#min chord has the root of F#., Voice leading is a common soloing technique. It involves playing a note (or notes) either a half or whole step away from the root of the next chord, before that next chord is played.   The notes surrounding the root of your next chord will resolve to that root. When you play the next chord, this technique creates a natural kind of transition between chords.	Break your song into chords. Solo by soloing according to the chord. Emphasize the root note of the chord in your solo. Voice lead into the root of your next chord.
If your fruit trees have been disturbed by an animal in the past, there is likely a route that the animal habitually takes to gorge on your plants. Places like a hole in your fence, a well-worn path leading from the garden, or entrances leading to a burrow are obvious signs of a known route. Set your trap up on these routes to maximize the chance that you'll catch it.You can maximize your chances of catching a burrowing animal by setting the trap up directly at the entrance of the hole.  A human scent on a trap can act as a deterrent for most animals and can prevent you from successfully trapping your animal. There are two main ways that you can mask your scent on the trap that you plan on using. One way is to wash the trap with a mild soap, then immerse it in boiling water to remove your scent. Another way to mask your scent is by leaving the trap outdoors in the sunshine for several days. Moving your trap outdoors will make the trap smell like the surrounding environment., Animals like chipmunks, squirrels, and rabbits will usually exhibit signs such as biting off large parts of the plant, eating an entire plant to the ground, or the removing and damaging individual fruit. Look for these signs to verify that your plants are being eaten by a mammal and not insects. Knowing which animal is eating your plant will help you get the right bait and appropriately sized trap. Monitor your plants and see which animals are pestering them.If you can't determine what animal is eating your fruit plants, you can set up hidden cameras to catch the animals in the act. If your plants are slowly being eaten away and there are small holes all over your fruit, chances are that insects have been eating it.  Different animals prefer different foods and will be attracted to different baits. For example, rabbits prefer foods like apples, carrots, pea pods, peppermint, or cider sprayed over the trap while raccoons enjoy sugar filled foods like marshmallows as well as different kinds of fish. Use the right bait for the animal that is eating your fruit plants. Opossums eat marshmallows, apples, melons, other fruit. Skunks prefer chicken, fish, and bacon. Squirrels enjoy nuts, seeds, and peanut butter.  A loose cage on the ground can be tipped over or manipulated by the animal in your yard. The doors on most live traps will only stay closed when the trap is sitting upright. To keep your trap standing upright, shove a metal rod through the trap into the ground to hold it in place. Alternatively, you could strap the trap to a tree or pile of rocks to secure it. Make sure that the trap is secure and won't fall over if an animal gets caught in it., Since all of these traps are no-kill traps, the final step in your animal trapping journey is to release them into the wild. Take the animal to a park or forest and carefully tip the trap to release it. Wild animals, even smaller mammals can be dangerous or carry disease, so be incredibly careful when releasing the critter. Confirm with your local park department if it's okay to release the animal you've trapped before you release it. If it's not authorized, then call animal control to come to your house to remove the animal.Wear thick construction gloves to protect your fingers from animal bites when handling the trap.	Set the trap in a known animal route. Mask your scent on the trap. Determine what animal is eating your fruit. Lay the appropriate bait in your trap. Set the trap up so it stands upright. Release the animal in a forest or park.
Fantasy films can be hard to categorize, as they can overlap with other genres. Usually, though, they feature supernatural forces, alien species, magic, and entities that can wield said magic.  Movies like this have many different characters, and often feature sprawling worlds for the characters to inhabit. Popular films like Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, and The Hobbit franchises fall into this category.  These typically feature a whimsical setting, unambiguously moral characters, and the famous happily ever after ending. Shrek is a fairy tale movie.  This is called a contemporary fantasy. The Harry Potter series is one such example.  This an urban fantasy film. Movies such as Nightbreed and Nightwatch are in this sub-genre.   The urban fantasy sub-genre is like "genreception", since it's technically a sub-genre of contemporary fantasy.  If you do notice any, you're probably watching a dark fantasy movie. Films like Pan's Labyrinth and Edward Scissorhands fall into this category.  Use movies like Conan the Barbarian and Deathstalker as a reference.	Identify fantasy films. Identify High Fantasy films. Identify fairy tales. Identify whether the movie has fantasy elements but takes place in modern day. Notice if the fantastical elements take place in a city, whether from the future, past, or modern day. Notice any dark themes within the fantasy movie. Notice if the film is a sword and sorcery movie.
Thoroughly wash the entire plate with hot, soapy water, then dry the dish completely with a clean dish towel.   The adhesive may not stick to a plate well enough if there is any dirt, grime, or oil on the back of that plate. For best results, use a scouring pad on the back of the plate in the general area the disc will be placed on. Adhesive plate hangers work especially well with plates that are strangely shaped or plates with notably thick rims. You can use them with any shape or size, though.  Adhesive plate hangers come in five basic sizes. Make sure that you choose a hanger size that will work for your specific plate.   The five sizes are:  1-1/4 inch (3 cm), for plates up to 4 inches (10 cm) in diameter 2 inches (5 cm), for plates up to 6 inches (15 cm) in diameter 3 inches (7.5 cm), for plates up to 8 inches (20 cm) in diameter 4 inches (10 cm), for plates up to 12 inches (30 cm) in diameter 5-1/2 inches (14 cm), for plates up to 6.5 lbs (3 kg) in weight    , Dip your fingertip in a little water, then rub your wet finger over the adhesive side of the disc. Wait three to seven minutes, or until the adhesive becomes sticky.  Look at the front of the plate to determine how you want the dish to hang. Once you determine where the center top will be, press the adhesive side of the disc firmly onto the back of the plate at the center top.   Press firmly over the entire adhesive disc to ensure a tight seal. You should let the adhesive dry overnight before you hang the plate. Test the bond by gently tugging on the hook. If the disc starts to peel away, the bond is not strong enough. If the disc stays firmly attached to the plate, however, it should be safe to use.  Figure out where you want the plate to hang and lightly mark that spot with pencil. Hammer a nail into that spot. At least half the nail should be inside the wall, but there should be enough nail hanging outside of the wall for the plate hook to rest on.   Make sure that the nail you use has a large head to "catch" the hook on so that the plate will not fall off. Alternatively, use a picture hanger instead of a plain nail. Determine where you want the plate by holding it against the wall. Mark the top of the plate on the wall using a light pencil mark.  Set the plate down. Measure the distance between the hanger hook and the top of the plate, then mark out that same distance from the mark on your wall. Hammer the nail into the second mark you made.  Gently hang the hook on the nail in the wall. Step back and take a look. If you are satisfied with the results, the process is now complete.   If the plate seems crooked, you will need to remove the hanger start over. If you ever need to remove the hanger, you can do so by soaking the entire contraption--both plate and hanger--in water. After a few minutes, the adhesive should wear away, allowing you to remove it from the back of the plate.	Clean the plate. Choose the right size hanger. Wet the disc. Attach the disc to the back of the plate. Hammer a nail into the wall. Hang the plate.
When shopping for new ballet slippers, don't be tempted to buy the ones that fit with room to spare, get a size down and stretch them to fit your foot exactly. Buy a pair of leather ballet shoes in a size lower than your normal size. , It should be very very tight, even painfully so.  Cover every part.  Push it until it stretches as far as it will go. , Pull your ballet slippers on––it will be a bit of a challenge, but persevere. Put on another pair of socks over the shoes. , Repeat the whole process a few hours later, and leave in a warm place each time.  Mark where to put elastics on, then take off and sew them in.  In about a week's time they will soften and mould exactly to your feet, leaving perfect fitting ballet shoes that will last you for ages.	Get a size smaller than usual for this method. Take off any elastic straps on the ballet shoes.  , Try to fit the shoe on your foot. Using rescue oil or bio-oil, rub the full leather exterior of the shoe. Get a wooden spoon, and push it into the toe part of the shoe. Do the same for the heel of the shoe.  , Whilst the shoe is oily still, put on two pairs of thick socks. Walk around in the shoes for an hour or two, until they are dry.  , Place the shoes in a warm place. With one pair of socks on, slip on the shoe. Wear your shoes all the time when you're at home.
One flower that looks lovely in ribbon is the poinsettia. To create your ribbon poinsettias, you will need a variety of supplies, including:1.5-inch (3.8-cm) wide velvet or satin ribbon in red, pink, white, and green Scissors Two long sewing pins Thread 24-gauge wire Wire cutters Hot glue gun and glue Gold rhinestones; , Start by making a single red poinsettia. To make it, you will need strips of green ribbon for the leaves, plus longer and shorter strips of red ribbon for the flower. Cut out:   Three four-inch (10 cm) strips of red ribbon Two two-inch (5 cm) strips of red ribbon Two six-inch (15 cm) strips of green ribbon  , With each piece of ribbon, you need both ends to come to a point, rather than being squared. Fold each piece of ribbon in half lengthwise. To make the pointed ends:At one end, cut from the tip of the folded edge downward at a 45-degree angle. Repeat on the other side. Open the fold, and the ribbon will have a triangular edge. Repeat with each piece of ribbon.  With each piece of red ribbon, you need to create a few folds to give the ribbon a more flower-like shape. To fold the ribbon strips, you need to:Fold the ribbon in half lengthwise, so the velvet sides are touching. Press down with your finger to make a crease in the ribbon. On one side, fold the ribbon in half again the other way to expose the velvet side, and make a crease. Repeat on the other side. Pinch the ribbon in the center and flare out the ribbon on either side. Pierce the ribbon through the middle of all three folds with the sewing pin. Do this with all three long strips, and pierce them all with the same pin. Repeat with the smaller red ribbon strips, but pierce them with the second pin.  Start with the longer red strips. Unwrap a length of wire from the spool and wrap it around the center points twice, right beside where the pin is. Remove the pin.You should now have six red flower petals. With the same length of wire, wrap the wire around the base of each petal once. This will help to separate the petals and keep them in place. When you have wrapped the base of each petal with wire, cut the wire with the wire cutter. Repeat these steps with the smaller red ribbon strips. You will end up with a smaller flower with two petals.  These two flowers will actually be glued together to create a single flower, because poinsettias have layers of larger and smaller flower petals. Plug in your hot glue gun.   When the glue is ready, place a pea-sized dab of glue at the center front (the velvet side) of the larger flower. Center the smaller flower over top of this and press it into the glue so that both velvet sides are facing up and the center wire bands match up., With the green ribbon strips, fold each piece in half lengthwise with the velvet sides touching. Make a crease in the ribbon. Pinch the center of each ribbon and criss-cross the strips so they make an X. Open up the ends of the ribbon.   With a new length of wire, attach the two pieces of ribbon together by wrapping the wire around horizontally and then vertically around the meeting point. When you have finished wrapping the leaves, wrap the wire around to the back (shiny side) of the ribbon and leave a four-inch (10 cm) stem of wire before cutting.  Place a pea-sized dab of glue at the center of the green ribbons. Center the red ribbon flower over this and press it into the glue.   To make the stamen at the center of the flower, place three or four small dots of glue into the center of the flower, and affix a gold rhinestone to each dab.  Repeat these steps to make more red, white, and pink poinsettia flowers with green leaves. You will need about 10 to make a basic garland.  To make your garland, you can affix the ribbon flowers to a premade garland. Check craft stores, hobby stores, Christmas stores, or online for a base.Garland bases are usually real or synthetic evergreen boughs that are made from or designed to mimic pine, fir, and other coniferous trees. Synthetic garlands will last much longer than ones made from real trees.  There are a number of ways that you can decorate the garland with your flowers, and how you do it is a matter of personal preference. You can put the flowers on:   In a straight line So that they cover the garland base In a zig-zag pattern With one at each end and one in the center  , When you’ve decided how you want to arrange the flowers on the garland, you can attach them properly. Take the wire stem from the leaves and wrap it around the entire garland base or just a few sprigs on the garland. Once you’ve attached the flower, fluff the garland so there aren't any bare spots.   If you didn’t leave a wire stem on your flowers, you can also affix the flowers with florist’s tape or with a needle and thread., There are many different flowers you can make with ribbon, including the ever-popular rose. To make these roses, you'll need 36 inches (91 cm) of florist’s ribbon or satin ribbon that’s 1.25 inches (3 cm) wide. You'll also need a measuring tape, tweezers, and thread or wire to secure the ribbon ends.Lay the ribbon flat on a table. Measure three inches (7.5 cm) in from one of the ends. At that point, make a 45-degree fold toward you, so that the ribbon forms an upside down L. Make a crease to secure the fold. Turn the ribbon 90 degrees in a counter-clockwise direction. Make another 45-degree fold toward you. Continue turning the ribbon 90 degrees in a counter-clockwise fashion and making a 45-degree fold. It will look like you're folding the ribbon into a small square. Stop when you have folded all but a three-inch (7.5-cm) tail at either end of the ribbon. At the end of the ribbon where you finished, trim the end to create a point. Push the end of the tweezers through the center of the squares from the bottom. Place the pointed end of the ribbon in between the tweezer prongs. Apply pressure to the tweezers as you pull the pointed end of the ribbon through the center of the squares and out the bottom. Continue pulling until you have a two-inch (five-cm) tail coming through the center. Hold on to the ribbon tail you pulled through the center, and gently spin the ribbon around in a counter-clockwise direction. As you do this, the ribbon squares will twist around the center, forming petals. Continue twisting until all the layers of ribbon squares have twisted into a rose shape. On the underside, hold the two ribbon ends together and secure them together with a needle and thread or wire wrap before trimming the excess.  Daisies are another popular flower that you can make with ribbon, and there are a wide variety of ribbon colors you can use to make these daisies. All you need for this project is 60 inches (152 cm) of satin ribbon that’s five-eights of an inch (1.6 cm) wide, scissors, a needle and thread, hot glue, and a rhinestone or gem for the center of the flower.Pinch one end of the ribbon between your thumb and forefinger. Measure out a piece of ribbon that’s 1.5 to two inches (3.8 to five cm) in length, then fold the ribbon back on itself to make a loop. Pinch the ribbon between your same thumb and forefinger to keep the loop secure. Continue making loops in the ribbon like this, stacking them on top of each other like accordion folds. You should make at least 10 to 15 loops, because each of these will become a flower petal. When you’ve made all the loops you want, use the needle and thread to secure the loops together. Place a few stitches on the bottom left corner of the loops (under where your thumb and forefinger were pinching the ribbon). Gradually fan out the ribbon loops so they make a complete circle like a flower. Adjust the loops so they are evenly distributed around the circle. When you're finished, turn the flower over to the side without the stitching. Place a pea-sized dab of hot glue in the center of the flower and secure a pearl, gem, or rhinestone.  Carnations are popular flowers for events like Mother’s Day, so a ribbon carnation is a lovely project if you want to make a ribbon flower wreath, broach, hair piece, or other craft. For this flower, you need 4.4 yards (400 meters) of wire-edged ribbon that’s one inch (25 cm) wide. You'll also need a needle, thread, and a pair of scissors.Take one end of the ribbon and push back the ribbon to expose the wire within. Gently tug the wire away from the ribbon. As you do so, slide the ribbon down the wire in the opposite direction, so it gathers toward the middle of the ribbon. Continue sliding the ribbon down the wire until you’ve gathered the entire piece down to about 30 inches (75 cm). Trim off the excess wire, leaving a one-inch (2.5-cm) tail. Tie a knot in the end of the ribbon where the wire is exposed, making sure to gather the wire end into the knot as well. Using the knot as the center of the flower, gradually wind the ribbon around the center knot, being sure that the gathered edge of the ribbon is exposed at the top. After every few laps around the knot, stop to put a few stitches into the ribbon on the underside to secure it in place. Continue wrapping the ribbon around the center and stitching every few wraps to secure the ribbon. When you get to the end of the ribbon, tie a knot that incorporates the wire inside as well. Trim off the excess ribbon from the knots at both ends, being careful not to cut the knots themselves. Finish wrapping the last layer of ribbon, and use the needle and thread to stitch it in place. Turn the flower to the right side and use your finger tips to gently pull and fluff out the gathers to fill out the flower.	Gather your supplies. Cut your ribbon. Trim the ribbon ends. Fold the red ribbon strips. Assemble the flowers. Attach the flowers. Make the leaves. Finish the flower. Make enough flowers for a garland. Find a garland base. Position the flowers on the garland. Affix the flowers to the garland. Create ribbon roses. Make daisies from ribbon. Put together a ribbon carnation.
Blotting is best done with a book that has not been completely waterlogged. If your book has encountered a spill or fallen into a puddle, pick it up by its spine, and shake any remaining water from the pages and spine with a gentle side-to-side motion. When done carefully, blotting can minimize fading and wrinkling.; , Carefully remove debris left behind from the water. This could be soggy leaves from a puddle or a candy wrapper from a water ring. Whatever the case may be, remove debris to avoid further damaging the paper you are drying.To remove debris from a damp book, remove it with your fingers or a pair of tweezers. To remove debris from a waterlogged book, gather a large tub of clean, fresh water, and gently dip the book into the water, removing it slowly. This will pull the debris free without risking damage to the already-wet pages.  Blot each page gently, using a clean white cloth, or a white paper towel. Moving the cloth side-to-side can tear wet pages. Blot each page gently and carefully before moving on to the next.If the pages are only slightly damp, you can place the rag between each page. If the pages are entirely waterlogged, however, blot any pages stuck together as a single page.  For a paperback cover, blotting is safest, as you still run the risk of ripping the paper. A hardback book may be wiped down, though the movement still needs to be light and gentle. Because the covers are more durable and hardier than the individual pages of the book, they do not need to be tended to as quickly.  Do not neglect the cover. Once you’ve finished drying, make sure you dry the covers thoroughly, as leaving water on the cover could damage the book’s binding and encourage mold growth.	Shake any excess water from the book. Remove dirt or debris. Gently apply pressure using a clean, white towel. Wipe down and blot the front and back cover.
Set up wicks inside clean teacups by placing the wick in between two wooden skewer sticks and taping the ends.   Place sticks with wick over the top of the cup so that the wick is standing in the middle of the cup.      ; , Place wax flakes in your double boiler or pan and turn heat on stove to medium.  Stir flakes frequently so flakes dissolve evenly. Flakes should appear opaque as they melt.       Add one or two drops of food coloring (or until desired color is achieved).  Using oven mitts to protect your hands, pour wax into waiting teacups. Pour slowly as you don’t want to disturb the position of the wick.  The wax should appear cloudy and smooth to the touch and it is ready.   Trim wick to size using sharp scissors.	Prepare cup(s). Melt wax. Pour melted wax into teacups. Allow for ample dry time before using or giving as a gift.
Always have two to five monologues ready to perform. You never know when a call is going to come up, and it’s best to be prepared rather than cramming at the last minute.   Make sure that the monologues are distinct. If one is dramatic, the other should be comedic. Likewise, it’s good to have one modern work and one classic or Shakespearean monologue. You'll stand out more if you choose unique monologues. Look through books and films for monologues that will allow you to showcase your special talent; chances are, they won't be the same ones the casting director has seen a hundred times before.  You need them to get an agent, as well as to audition at open casting calls.   Work with a professional photographer who specializes in acting and performance headshots, and make sure that he or she will provide make-up and hair styling. Know your type. Roles are written for certain looks and types, and you should have photos that meet these casting criteria. If your look and acting-age is “high school cheerleader,” include that look in your photo package. Likewise, if you’d make a great vampire, suburban mom or mob-wife, have photos taken that capture that aspect of your look and acting-age. Get electronic copies of your headshots. Some agencies may ask you to email your resume and headshots. Make sure your printed headshots are the same size as your resume. If you plan on printing your resume on standard 8 1/2" x 11" paper, your headshot should be the same size. It looks more professional this way.  A demo reel is footage that showcases your acting work. Make sure your plays are filmed, and prearrange with directors to use the work in your reel. The site www.productionapprentice.com/tutorials/general/create-a-winning-demo-reel-that-people-will-actually-watch/ has great tips on how to cater your demo reel to each casting director.  It's important to get a franchised, licensed agent. Many people who are not agents will claim to be. Real agents are licensed by the state, and generally receive 10% of your earnings.   A great way to meet an agent is to attend a casting workshop. A casting workshop is an opportunity for actors to audition in front of a number of agents and casting directors. You do have to pay to participate, but it’s a fantastic way to get your name and face out there. Do an online search for casting workshops in your area. The Call Sheet, which can be accessed at www.backstage.com, has a list of reputable talent agents. The SAG-AFTRA (Screen Actors Guild and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists) website, www.sagaftra.org, also has lists of agents.    SAG-AFTRA is the screen actors’ labor union. SAG-AFTRA can get you higher paying (and higher profile gigs), provides health insurance and makes sure that your work is not misused. It also opens the door to more audition opportunities, as agents have access to union calls. Actors’ Equity is the stage actors’ union. Again, it provides health insurance, and ensures fair wages and decent working conditions for stage actors. Equity actors also get to participate in workshops and seminars, and again have access to a greater number of auditions.	Memorize several monologues. Get headshots. Get a demo reel. Find a talent agent. Get your SAG-AFTRA card, or your Actors Equity Card.
You might have noticed going over potholes and bumps isn't as smooth as it used to be in your ride, which is probably a sign that your shocks are worn out and need replaced. A good easy way to test your shocks and make sure they're worn out enough to be replaced is to push down hard on the trunk or the hood directly above the wheel well. Good shocks should bounce up once and settle relatively quickly. If the body bounces any more than that after pushing, it's time for a new set.   You also need to know if your vehicle uses stand-alone shocks that attach to the vehicle suspension or frame, or if it uses shock-absorber units which integrated into a suspension strut, such as the MacPherson or Chapman strut. Your car may even have a combination, using shocks in the front and struts in the back. Struts can be difficult to replace, so it's best to let a professional handle that job.; , If you're unsure what type of shock absorbers you need, speak to someone at your local auto parts store or an auto mechanic to be sure you buy the right shock absorbers or piston for your vehicle.  You can get identical replacements of the shocks you have in your car currently, but taking the time to change out your shocks is also a good opportunity to perform any upgrades, if you're interested. Performance shocks are appropriate for heavy-use daily drive vehicles, especially trucks.Coil shocks are manufactured with a coiled spring around the body of the shock, which supports the weight of the vehicle and controls the movement of the suspension. These are adjustable, which means you can alter the height of your truck for optimum performance.  Twin-tube shocks have a set of tubes, one inner and one out, that house the piston, along with a layer of shock fluid and air, which can have a tendency to create a foamy, frothy mixture that can affect performance, though some modern variations feature a nitrogen mixture that addresses the issue. These are common on off-road vehicles.  Monotube shocks feature a tube and two pistons, which work essentially like the twin-tube shocks work, with one piston separating the layer of nitrogen from the air. It runs cool and is a popular performance choice for trucks.  Reservoir shocks are filled with fluid, and either pressurized air or nitrogen. As the shock absorbs bounce, the fluid contacts the gas, causing resistance and dampening the spring action.  Park your car on a level surface and loosen the lug nuts on both sides of the front or back end. Secure your vehicle with ramps and/or jack stands. Check your owner's manual for the correct jack positioning. When you've got the car up, remove the wheels and locate the shocks.   Shocks will be affixed with a vertical bolt that has to be extracted from within the engine bay or the trunk, or may be positioned at the top by a horizontal bolt that has to be unfastened and knocked out of position.  The most difficult part of the job is removing the old shocks, which can have a tendency to be really gunky with both age and road-grit, making the bushings and bolts somewhat difficult to remove. Check out the mountings to see if they're loose enough to get off, or if you're likely to crack the rubber around the bushing. It's ok if you do, since you're changing out the shock anyway, but it's usually easier to spray some WD-40 or PB Blaster in there and let it sit for a few minutes to try to loosen things up before you get to work.  Lots of cars have the top bolts under the fabric in the trunk of the car, which means you'll have to lift up the lining to get to the shock bolts and remove them with a ratchet and socket. As always, consult your shop manual for more specific guidelines regarding the location of the shock tower bolts. In general, though, they'll be in the trunk.   To unfasten the bolts, turn the socket and ratchet counterclockwise, greasing the bolts with penetrating fluid to eliminate any surface rust, if necessary.  Use a socket set or a nut splitter to disengage the nut that connecting the shock to the suspension, and remove it from the bolt. If there isn't enough room to operate the splitter, you can apply penetrating solvent.   Depending on the assembly, you may also need to disengage the knuckle at the top of brake assembly to get the the shock. Consult your owner's manual to find out for sure. Use the same process to remove the nut that is positioned at the top and keep the nuts separate so you will know which one goes where when it is time to install your new shocks., Wiggling the shock off the bolts can be surprisingly difficult, especially if the shocks are mounted on studs with a retaining bracket and everything's rusty. Wiggle it around a while and it should come off eventually.   One common frustration occurs when your piston rod keeps turning with you as you're trying to loosen the nut. You can use locking pliers on the end of the rod and keep it from turning with the pliers while loosening the nut with a wrench, but that can be just as frustrating. There's a hollow hex kit that fits over the rod and a tailored wrench made for the purpose, available at any auto parts store for about eleven bucks. If you need to bang on the bolt with a hammer or the end of your wrench to get it loose, that's ok, but make sure you put one the nuts back on to use as a hitting surface. Don't risk misaligning the bolt and messing up your ability to reinstall the shock properly. Let the metal cleaner do its work and take your time. It'll give.  You might need to use some pressure to constrict the shock as it falls into place, and you might need a help to help lift the suspension back up to reinstall the bolts in the correct positions. It can be kind of a balancing act, so it helps to have another set of hands. Screw on the nuts hand tight.  Reattach it and screw the bolts back on hand-tight. Replace the shock tower nuts you removed at the beginning of the process, probably in the trunk of the vehicle.  Before you go tightening everything back down, recheck the specifications for torque to be sure everything's secure.  Most of the shocks should wear out at the same time, so if you're going to do one, you're probably going to end up doing them all. Do in following the same steps and then put the wheels back on and tighten the lug nuts to finish the job.	Make sure you need new shocks. Purchase new shock absorbers. Consider upgrading your shocks. Jack your vehicle in an appropriate location. Check the shock mountings and spray them with metal cleaner. Remove bolts from the shock tower. Disconnect the shock from the suspension. Remove the shock absorber from the bottom and top bolts. Fit the new shock back onto the suspension control arm. If needed, you may once again affix the anti-roll bar if you removed it earlier. Check your torque specs in the service manual. Repeat the steps to replace the other 3 shock absorbers, if necessary.
Stick to the type of work that's their specialty.   Don't haggle over changes, give them a hard time or get too controlling. Part of supporting the arts is to encourage the artist to go on being an artist. You're not buying real arts in order to get the cheapest bargain or rip off the painter for a masterpiece by paying less than he did for the materials! If you do that, there's a good chance the artist will get disgusted, quit and do something else for a living, which reduces the appreciation of that masterpiece.	When buying art, choose an artist you enjoy (of any kind, performance or tangible) and then keep your description of your commission simple.
Keep alert and always report suspicious incidents to the authorities. If a student or co-worker talks about killing people or threatens to bring a knife or a gun to school, report this to a teacher or law enforcement. You may prevent a disaster by doing so. Many shooters often announce their plans ahead of schedule as a way of showing off; do not take their behavior lightly or as a joke and report it immediately. , Every school and office has some kind of lockdown procedure that stipulates how doors should be locked, where people should hide, and how the authorities should be called, so if you'd like to be prepared for a shooting, be familiar with your workplace's standard procedure when it comes to shootings. Unfortunately, it may be difficult to follow the protocol exactly in the event of a shooting, but knowing what it is can help you react in the most helpful way possible.  Though you should not bring a weapon to school or to the workplace just in case there is a shooting, if you'd really like to be prepared, you should take self-defense classes or other classes that teach you how to fight off an attacker in the event of an attack or shooting. Knowing a few fighting tricks can help you feel more confident if you have no choice but to attack a shooter.	Report any suspicious activity. Be aware of your school or workplace's lockdown procedure. Be prepared for a shooting.
In the anime series Kakashi gives a chilling impression that you do not want to meet him in a battle. He is always calm and almost never surprised.   Slouch slightly.      ; , Always try to win and take the easy way out. Act very aloof with them and logical.  If you want to hide your eye use his technique or get a side-fringe to hide it.  As you can see in the anime he always carries books around. Try to read whole collections of books that interests you.   If your favorite book has been turned into a movie, it's a must-see movie end of story and no questions asked. , Be amazing at sports, and get ripped. Try your best in every sport.  This is incredibly important especially at work and in school. This will show people that you are serious on becoming him.   If at school or other places, you can use a face mask. Not only is it not going to raise suspicion, but you can wear it all the time. If people ask you about it, tell them stupid or unbelievable reasons like Kakashi does.  Kakashi is always serious and never makes unnecessary jokes. , Kakashi always acts half asleep but in truth he is always alert for the slightest thing out of the ordinary.    Blow off people that make a big deal about things.    When fighting, analyze and copy your opponents moves. ,, That way you can put your mouth-covering on again before anyone sees what you look like.  If someone asks something about you, don't get into too much detail; try to change the subject. , Kakashi spies on Naruto and other people all the time.	Look and be incredibly laid back and "cool".

Antique stores are an excellent place to find vintage silver coins. Ask your local shop owners if they collect or sell "junk silver," the antique term for old coins in good condition.If so, inspect their coin collection for silver half dollars. Thrift shops may also carry vintage coins, depending on their policies.  Ask friends who work in retail to put aside half dollars for you. You can come into their store and trade your paper money for their half dollars, which you can then inspect.  Search in your local classifieds for flea market listings. When you arrive, move from booth to booth and look for vendors selling coins. If you find a silver half dollar, ask your vendor questions about where they obtained it and whether they have a certificate of authenticity for the coin.If you want to get up early on the weekends, check garage and estate sales. Someone nearby may be selling their personal coin collections. Yard sales aren't a guaranteed place to find silver coins, but you never know.  Look for reputable coin dealers in your area and ask if they have silver half dollars for sale. Dealers often work with a variety of coins, and you're likely to find at least one who sells half dollars.  Find a dealer who is an Authorized Purchaser working with the U.S. Mint. This guarantees that your coin dealer is professional and safe. Most Authorized Purchasers have been in the business for over five years and have a strong client base. , Buy or build a metal detector and go searching in local areas. The best spots to look for coins are urban areas, like beaches, ski resorts, or campsites.Metal detecting will help you find a variety of old coins: you never know whether you'll get lucky and find a silver half dollar.  Heavily-trafficked areas are best for finding coins. While you can metal detect in the countryside or forests, you are unlikely to find what you're looking for. For older coins, visit old areas. A building constructed in the last ten years might not have older coins, but a building fifty or more years old might have vintage coins.	Check local stores. Visit flea markets. Purchase half dollars from coin dealers. Use a metal detector.
While this may sound difficult, you can save money if you can locate the leak for the plumber.   If you know you have a shut-off valve by the house, shut it off temporarily and check the meter by removing the lid and watching the dial on top of the meter. If you can't see the meter head, try digging around because they sometimes have dirt or grass covering the top of them. Once you locate it and the valve is turned off by the house, watch the meter to see if is turning. If it is still turning, then the leak is between the meter and the house. That is, unless you have a leaking valve, and this very common with these older bronze gate valves. Then, your leak may also be inside the house. At this point, walk the area between the meter and the shut-off valve. Look for signs of a leak such as: soft muddy areas, grass that is greener than the rest or growing much faster than other areas. If you see such an obvious sign, call the plumber or assess if you can make a repair yourself.  Try some other techniques to try to locate the problem.	If the toilets are fine, check the line running from the meter to the house. If you have the valve shut off at the house and the meter has stopped moving, then the leak is somewhere in the house.
Generally, a cajon is made of two different thicknesses of wood, thinner for the striking surface and slightly thicker for the rest of the instrument.         Use 1/8 inch plywood for the tapa. The tapa is the striking surface of the instrument, and you'll generally use a piece sized 13 inch by 19 inch for most cajons. For the other sides of the instrument, use 1/2 inch plywood.; , Prepare the body of the cajon by cutting the correct measurements to form the basic box. Make sure the cuts are very straight by clamping a metal ruler to the sheet of plywood and using a jigsaw or circular saw.          The top and bottom pieces should be 13 inch by 13 inch The single rear piece should be 13 inch by 18 inch The sides should be 12 1/2 inch by 18 inch  , Drill a hole towards the edge of the marked sound hole, and use that as a starting point to cut out the sound hole with a jigsaw.          Round and sand the edges to create an even and clean edge.  One of the distinctive things about the sound of the cajon is the snare-drum-like rattle made when hitting the tapa. This comes from attaching several strings of snares you can either make yourself, salvage from an old snare drum, or use new snares and attach to the inside of the drum.         A snare is basically a string or wire stretched to tension and outfitted with something that rattles. If you wanted to make your own, using old guitar strings, fishing line, or other wire would be perfectly appropriate for a homemade cajon. For rattles, try paperclips, sinkers, or other tiny metal salvaged materials that make a good rattling sound.  Start with the base and one of the side pieces, applying a liberal amount of wood glue. Next, glue the other side piece and the top to create the basic frame.          Have a helper steady the pieces as you add the glue and keep them as straight as possible, or cut guide pieces to keep inside the box and ensure straight angles.  Big carpentry clamps would be ideal, but luggage straps will do in a pinch. Strap ample pressure to the piece while the wood glue dries. Let it sit for several hours before adding the back, tapa, and snares.          Wipe off any excess glue with a wet cloth and read the instructions for the particular variety of wood glue you purchase for advice about pressure and drying time.  Depending on what you're using for snares, you can do this in a variety of different ways. Ideally, you might purchase some tuning pegs from the music store to be able to "tune" the snares periodically.          Stretch the snares diagonally from the top corners of the side that will be the tapa, roughly 3 inches from each corner on the top and on the side. Screw them in with wood screws, or attach them to tuning pegs for more control over the sound.  Apply the front and back piece as before and apply pressure for the same length of time. Orient the back piece so that the sound hole is at the base of the instrument, and the snares are at the top. You might also consider applying wood screws for added stability in your instrument. You're going to be sitting on it, so it's worth putting some extra strength into it.  Rubber or cork can also be used. It's ideal to have a somewhat cushioning surface to set the box on, since it's going to be holding up your weight as well. Putting plywood on the ground can scratch some surfaces.  Use sandpaper and take some time smoothing out the edges and the surfaces. Sand your cajon with progressively finer sanding paper, then finish to your liking.  Decorate the instrument with your own personal style. Finish it will wood stain for a professional and classy look, or hook it up with psychedelic Neptunes and polar bears for a wild hippy look. Have fun with it.	Get enough plywood to build your cajon. Cut out the required sheets of plywood. Trace a 12cm diameter hole on the rear piece. Fashion your snares. Glue the basic frame. Apply pressure. Attach the snares before gluing on the tapa. Glue on the tapa and the back piece. Cut out feet from leftover pieces of wood and screw them to the bottom. Round the top side corners to make it more comfortable to sit on. Give it some flair.
It’s best if the whole family can be involved – mom, dad, sister, brother, even your dog. It’s the most fun if it’s in the evening because kids will think they are getting to “stay up late”. However, if you have young children or children with busy schedules, perhaps the movie shouldn’t run late into the night. Ending at 7:00 or as late as 8:30 is a good choice.; , It doesn’t matter whether it’s the media room or living room. It should be a comfortable space with room for everyone to sit – preferably on a couch together. You don’t have to buy a huge TV; just something bigger than an iPod screen will work.  Popcorn, by itself, is a light snack that everyone will enjoy. It’s good with M&Ms, but it’s up to you to decide what goes with it. You could even try cinnamon-sugar popcorn by first putting melted butter over the popcorn and then liberally sprinkling a container of cinnamon-sugar over it all. Eating snacks while watching a movie may be lazy, but it makes the evening 100% better. If the children are prone to fighting, you can give them individual bowls of popcorn. If kids are eating too fast, tell them there is plenty and that they need to slow down.  (See “Tips” for suggest movies.) Ask for movie suggestions. Make sure it is age-appropriate. Your teenager may suggest a movie you aren’t comfortable with your kids seeing. It is perfectly fine to deny your teen that choice in a nice way. You can suggest that she make a more family-friendly selection, indicating that she gets another shot at choosing. If your children don’t agree on a movie or can’t choose one, make a few family friendly suggestions, preferably rated G or even PG, depending on how old your children are and how well they could handle a slightly more mature movie. Family movie night, with children, should not go above PG. You don’t want your child to have nightmares! Try to encourage a movie that none of you have seen before, or you haven’t seen in a long time. Films rated PG however, might not be suitable for children below age 10, so its recommended to see a G rated film if you have children under 10.  This gives a sort of movie theatre illusion and makes the entire atmosphere much more fun. In addition, the TV screen is a lot brighter.  Laugh with your children during hilarious scenes, but try not to talk to anyone during the movie; it’s distracting.  Did they like it? Was it scary, sad, funny? Who was their favorite character? What was their favorite part? Children will enjoy talking about this and reviewing their favorite scenes – even reenacting them!  , You can simply talk about it or dig deeper into the subject – whatever you and your family is comfortable with.	Begin at a time that is good for everyone. Select the room you are going to watch the movie in. Make popcorn. Pick a movie. Turn the lights off, if no one will get scared and cry about it. Ask everyone to be quiet and tell them to enjoy the movie. At the end of the movie, ask your family what they thought about it. If there was a moral of the story (and there usually is), discuss it with your family. Bedtime is a great way to end a movie night!

For many pennies, one tablespoon (15 g) of salt in 1/2 cup (4 oz) of vinegar will get the job done. Stir the mixture to dissolve the salt.          If you don't have vinegar, use lemon or even orange juice. Copper oxide (the gunk on your pennies) dissolves in weak acid, and that's just what all three of these liquids are.; , Make sure they are not directly on top of each other.  If they're extra dirty or if you're cleaning a lot simultaneously, give them a few more minutes for good measure.          For those especially nasty pennies, scrub them with a scrubber or toothbrush after they've been resting in the solution for a bit.  Let them dry for around five minutes so they will no longer be wet. They will now sparkle.          If you don't wash them off, a blue-green sheen will develop on your pennies. That's what happens when the copper, oxygen, and chlorine (from the salt) combine (called malachite).	Put 1 tsp (5 g) of salt into 1/4 c (2 oz) of vinegar. Place your pennies in the vinegar or the lemon juice. Leave the pennies for around five minutes in the glass of vinegar or lemon juice. Take the pennies out, and wash them off.
Sitting in the chair cross-legged or on the edge will affect your horn angle.      ; , This is one of the most important parts of correct posture.   If you sit slouched, it will affect how much air support you blow into your horn.       If you lean into the back of the chair, more than likely, you are sitting slouched.  This is how your horn angle should be.   It should be between your kneecaps, if done properly.	Sit firmly in the chair, with feet flat on the ground. Keep your spine straight, preventing it from touching the back of the chair. Have the clarinet facing a forty-five degree angle.
Protect them not only from moisture, but light as well, which will cause the pages to fade.Use a box that is specially designed for comic books, since a wider box may allow room for your upright comics to fall over sideways. Select between “long” and “short” boxes.Even if you plan on expanding your collection in the future, buy a box that is appropriately sized for your current collection. Storing 100 comics in a “long” box that fits 300 will allow room for your upright comics to fall forward. With cardboard boxes, make sure that the cardboard is acid-free. For the most protection from outside elements, use plastic boxes.  Place each comic in the box vertically, as opposed to laying it flat on its back cover. Give yourself the ability to quickly search through titles without having to remove each and every comic first. Additionally, avoid the damage that may occur from stacking comics on top of each other.The combined weight of so many comics stacked on top of each other may press together the pages of those at the base, forming a seal, which will cause tears when you try to open them again. Additionally, if the edges of the comics themselves are not lined up exactly with each other, the weight of those on top may cause the corners or edges of those below to bend and crease.  Choose a storage space with consistent temperatures and humidity, since extreme changes in heat and moisture may hasten aging. Avoid placing them near sources of heat or cold, like radiators or a/c vents. Also avoid areas that are prone to leaks or flooding.To be extra cautious, shelve your boxes rather than set them directly on the floor, since moisture may still accumulate there, even without flooding.If you don't have adequate shelving, place your boxes on another raised surface, such as a pallet.Avoid stacking cardboard boxes if possible. If you must, keep your stacks to a maximum of five boxes each to prevent the ones on the bottom from being crushed under all that weight. Label each box according to your organizational method.Rotate the one at the bottom of the stack to the top periodically so no one box bears the brunt of all that weight over the long run. Ideal temperatures are between 50 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit (10 and 21 degrees Celsius). Humidity should ideally be around 35 percent, never more than 50 percent.	Store your comics in boxes. Stand them upright. Store your boxes safely.
Before you add your varnish, use paint to create an additional decorative design along the outside of your beads. For extra texture, use puff paint which dries in a bubble-like form above the surface of the bead.  To make your beads sparkly, use glitter glue or loose glitter over the surface of the paper. Add the glitter before your final coat of varnish to keep it from rubbing off as a result of wear and tear. Try adding several coats of glitter in different colors for a lovely rainbow effect.  Don't thread the beads on string; use string to create a decorative pattern along the outside of the paper. Cut a small piece of colored thread and use glue to wrap the exterior of the bead with the string. Use several pieces of string for added color and texture.  Use colored florists wire to thread the beads and create pretty spiral or geometric patterns around the outside. Run the wire through the middle of the bead, and then bend it to shape around the bead.  Use a translucent nail polish or watered down paint to coat your bead in an additional color. Adding the glaze will create a light, semi-opaque layer of color over the paper. You can also use watercolor paints for this.,	Add paint. Put on a little glitter. Wrap the beads up in string. Use a little wire. Give your beads a glaze. Finished.
You can stick to one kind or both, and it is a good idea to vary the colors if possible. For example, lentils come in a range of colors, including browns, blacks, yellows and oranges. Beans come in different shades and patterns too.   Keep the size differences in mind. Placing too large a bean or lentil next to a much smaller one may not be the look you're after in the mosaic design. Think about how you want the general design to be in terms of sizes before selecting the lentils and/or beans.; , It can be a canvas, a tile, a CD case or a wooden board. A canvas tends to look more professional for a wall hanging but it's really up to you and the end purpose to which you'll be putting the mosaic.  The design can be sourced from your imagination or from the internet (check art sites such as DeviantArt or Etsy and image sites such as Pinterest or Flickr for inspiration). Some design examples to help you include:   Abstract: Randomly placed lentils/beans, perhaps varying in colors and sizes. Abstract is likely to be the easiest choice for the beginner mosaic maker. A landscape: Use the colors and shapes of the lentils/beans to depict trees, flowers, fields, the sky, people and animals, etc. A portrait: Choose a famous person or a family member to replicate in a lentil/bean mosaic. A tracing: For example, trace around a hand, a foot or an object that you like the shape of. Make a rough draft of your drawing first so that you can have an idea of certain features, such as placement and defining of specific objects.  Transfer your final design onto the chosen canvas, outlining the areas clearly. Do not draw anything too small to add the lentils/beans to––keep the size of your mosaic objects in mind as you draw.  Follow the design and the color scheme you've chosen. Apply the liquid glue to a small area, then sprinkle the lentils/beans over the glue. After few seconds, press gently on the lentils to help them to adhere firmly to the canvas.  Continue working in sections, adding glue, then the mosaic items, until the drawing is filled.  In order for the mosaic to last a long time, spray varnish across it. This will also give it a glossy and firm look, which provides for a pleasant presentation.  Hang or display the mosaic for your family to see.	Select the lentils or dried beans you would like to form the mosaic. Decide on which surface you will present your mosaic. Decide which design will you will use for making the mosaic. Place the rough draft of your drawing beside where you're going to prepare the canvas for the mosaic. Apply the lentils/beans to the mosaic background. Repeat. Seal the design. Done.
It won't be a good day if you singe off your eyebrows and get third-degree burns on your hands, so turn off your car and let it cool down before you open up the hood and get to work. Let it sit for at least an hour before you start dissecting its parts.   It's not a dumb idea to protect yourself with goggles or gloves, either. If you don't want anything getting in your eyes or your hands getting covered in gunk, get out the protective gear. And, of course, a shirt you don't mind smudging with grease or oil.  The thermostat and radiator hose are linked to your car's cooling system; if you don't drain out the coolant, you're gonna get water everywhere when you start disassembling. Here's how:   Place a bucket (or some sort of container) underneath your radiator. You'll have somewhere between 4 to 8 cups of fluid pouring out, so don't skimp on the size of your container. At the bottom of the radiator, there should be a draining screw or cap (technically, it's a radiator drain cock). Twist this to the left, opening it up. Let all the water and coolant flow out. Keep the cap somewhere you won't lose it.  Every model of car is different. Some thermostats you could spot from a mile away, others will be an obstacle to even the most trained of eyes. If looking at your car's engine is like reading gibberish, find the radiator hose and follow it to the end -- that'll be where your thermostat is located.   The body of the thermostat is probably metal with a bit of gold in the center and possible a rubber ring around the edges. It resembles a top or dreidel in shape and size, or, a small plunger. If you're not quite sure what you're doing, consult your manual or look up the location online. It's better to know what you're looking for instead of poking around and possibly injuring yourself.  The hose is most likely clamped to the thermostat casing. Unscrew this and set it aside. Move onto the thermostat casing, exposing the thermostat itself. You will definitely need a screwdriver, and you may need pliers, for the record.   Most vehicles have a two-bolt or three-bolt system for the thermostat casing. If corrosion and gunk is building up prominently, clean up the area before you go about adding your new thermostat. A bit of water will probably come out with removal of the hose. This is normal.  Is it possible that your thermostat works, it's just stuck closed or a different part of your vehicle is starting to kick the bucket, affecting your thermostat's ability to make accurate readings? If so, it's very easy to test your thermostat. Here's how:   Get a pot of water boiling. Insert your thermostat. The thermostat should open at around 190 ºF (88 ºC). Since water boils at 212ºF (100ºC), this is more than enough. If the thermostat doesn't open in the water (and then close when it cools), you need a new one.  From here on out, it's mainly a matter of reassembly -- the easy stuff. Replace your thermostat just like it the old one was positioned. If applicable, replace the rubber ring, too, sealing the edges.   If the area is building up dirt and grime, wipe it down with some cleaner first. You want to maximize the life of your thermostat and not have to deal with this again anytime soon.  You remember what everything looked like, right? Here's a brief checklist:   Make sure the thermostat is snug and in place. Bolt down the thermostat casing over top of the thermostat. Finger start your bolt and then bust out your pliers or socket wrench and get to tightening. Be careful not to strip the bolts. Replace the radiator hose and clamp. The radiator should be snug on the outside of the thermostat casing and the clamp must be well-tightened.  If the coolant you just drained out was fairly new, just use the same stuff in the bucket and add it back in. If it was old, you may be better off throwing the contents of the bucket out and just using new coolant. Either way, replace the coolant and make sure the radiator drain cock is on tight.   Once replaced, check for leaks. Your car needs coolant to operate safely. If yours is leaking, you literally won't get very far.  You're done! Now all you have to do is keep an eye on your temperature gauge. If it's acting up, do a double check to make sure you secured everything appropriately. If so, you may need to consult a mechanic -- the problem probably lies elsewhere.	Make sure your car has cooled down. Drain the antifreeze out of your car. Locate your thermostat. Remove the radiator hose and take apart the thermostat casing. If desired, test your thermostat. Swap out your old thermostat for the new one. Reassemble the system. Replace the coolant and check for leaks. Get back on the roads.
Once you have found someone to assume the lease, you need to work with your leasing company to ensure everything is properly agreed and all the paperwork is complete. Each financial institution has its own procedure for lease assumption, but the procedure generally includes:   Submission of credit application by the new owner. When taking over a lease, a potential owner/lessee will have to fill out a credit application and be approved for the total amount remaining on the lease.Payoff or transfer of the current lease. Once the new owner/lessee is approved for purchase/lease of the vehicle, the lease or title will be transferred to him or her. Creation of new lease in new lessee name. When lease for the vehicle has been opened or transferred, the new lessee becomes responsible for the remaining payments on it. If you are operating through a lease trading company they will guide you through this process., The buyer will no doubt want to take a test drive in the car before completing the deal. They will also want to inspect the vehicle to verify that is in the condition you stated in the listing or advert.This is important for both buyer and seller, as you will both inspect the car together and agree on its condition. Having a clear and recorded understanding will avoid potential disputes down the line.   The seller should always accompany the buyer on the test drive. Be sure you are present for any independent inspections of the vehicle. It can be helpful to take photographs to ensure that you have proof of any minor blemishes or damage., When turning over a vehicle to a new owner, you will want to be sure to remove all personal items. That means taking out your iPod, gloves, charger cord, and any other items of personal property out of the vehicle. After this, be sure you clean the interior of the vehicle. Wipe down the dash, doors, and steering wheel, and clean the inside and outside of all the windows. Take the vehicle through the car wash or wash it yourself. Be sure to put a nice wax on it when you are through.  Depending on the arrangement you have reached, you will pass the car on to the leasing company, lease trading company, or directly to the person taking over the lease. Follow the instructions you have been given by your lease company to turn the vehicle over. Most companies will pick up the vehicle and handle turning it over to the buyer.   If you are in possession of the title to the vehicle, you will need to sign it over to the new owner or your financial institution. Check with the lease company for instructions on whom to sign over title to. Contact your state's Motor Vehicle Department to transfer ownership. This will eliminate the possibility that you might be held liable for any damages after the transfer. Once the paper work is all complete, and you have handed over the keys, the process is complete.	Contact your lease company. Take the buyer for a test drive. Prepare the vehicle for its new owner. Turn over the vehicle.
A petrol-driven generator with a rated power of about 3500W will serve for lighting, TV, fans and a fridge or freezer. The rated power is usually written on the body of the generator and it is that power the generator can deliver continuously for an average of 12 hours on a single tank of fuel.; , A typical microwave, for instance, uses 1500 watts, while a whole circuit of lights with CFC bulbs may only require 150 watts. Refrigerators use about 1200 - 1500 watts, but have a starting capacitor which increases the wattage momentarily when the compressor starts. Televisions use less the 1000 watts, depending on the type and size, a small room fan may use about 500 watts, and so on.  There are several different wiring systems that can be used to connect a generator to a home. The main two are discussed here. Contact your local Department of Labor and Industries, Planning Department, or Power Company to find out what is legal in your area. Do not consult the internet to find out which system is legal in your area. There are many people that are unqualified to offer advice doing just that, and the law can vary significantly between countries, states, and even cities.   Consider an interlock kit. These are fairly simple to install yourself and they are the cheapest option. However, they are illegal in many areas and can be very unsafe. They must be installed absolutely correctly. Safe installation also requires that you have several extra spaces in your existing breaker box or that you install a new one, which must be done professionally. It is also a strict requirement that you get a kit that is approved for your specific breaker box (should be made by the same company). Consider a manual transfer switch. This is a slightly more expensive piece of equipment which will require a professional install. However, it is the only guaranteed legal option and it is accordingly the safest. This will help keep you from accidentally electrocuting someone else or even yourself.  This hookup will go on the outside of your house and will have a recessed male connector (prongs that stick out, rather than holes you plug in to). It will connect to whichever panel system you installed inside your house. The installation should be performed by a professional, both to keep you safe and to make sure your system remains up to code. If you do not have this done by a professional, your insurance may be unable to cover your home, the city you live in could enforce a heavy fine, and you are very likely to hurt either yourself or someone else (in a hospital-if-you're-lucky kind of way).  You will find a lot of advice and instructions offered on the internet that are unsafe and put you at risk for injury, electrocution, or serious house fire. Be sure to always check with your city specialists before doing anything that will put you or your family at risk. Some common Do Nots include:   Do not connect your generator directly to your breaker box without an approved transfer switch. Do not connect your generator to a washing machine or dryer outlet.  This is especially important if you do not have experience with electrical work. You want to be sure that your family stays safe and, in the event of a fire, that your insurance company cannot dispute your claim because of "faulty wiring".	Determine the essential appliances in the home you cannot do without. List the appliances and electrical devices you plan to use, then look at their wattage or power requirement. Choose a wiring system. Install an inlet box hook up. Keep your family safe!, Get your setup inspected.
You will use some air for priming and testing your sprayer, so let it build up pressure while you get your paint ready. The compressor should have a regulator to allow you to set the pressure for the sprayer correctly; otherwise, fluctuations will occur as the pressure rises and falls while you are spraying.  The exact amount will vary depending on your sprayer, so look at the manual (or the equipment itself) for details.  Make sure it is tight; you may want to wrap the threads with Teflon tape to insure an airtight seal. This does not apply if your sprayer and hose are equipped with quick connect couplings.  (This is the reservoir attached to the bottom of your spray gun.) Use just enough to submerge the siphon tube in it.  This is usually the lower of two screws above the handle (pistol grip) of the sprayer.  Aim the nozzle into a waste bucket and squeeze the trigger. It usually takes a few seconds for the sprayer system to prime with liquid, so at first, only air will come out of the nozzle. After a moment, you should get a flow of paint thinner. If no thinner comes out of the nozzle, you may have to disassemble the sprayer to check for stoppages or loose seals in the siphon tube assembly.  A funnel helps, here, so you can return it to the original container. Mineral spirits and turpentine (two common thinners) are flammable solvents, and should only be stored in their original containers.	Turn on the air compressor. Adjust the regulator on the compressor to between 12 and 25 PSI (pounds per square inch). Attach the air hose coupling to the sprayer. Pour a small amount of paint thinner into the paint cup. Open the metering valve slightly. Prime the sprayer. Empty the spray cup of any remaining thinner.
Whether you’ve experienced nightmares that have been waking you up at night or overall insomnia, a disrupted sleeping pattern can signal stress and a feeling of anxiety. Monitor your sleep in the last six weeks. Have you noticed a difference? Do you sleep significantly less?   Use sleeping pills with caution. Their usefulness is debated and there are accidental deaths linked to them. Never use them without talking to your doctor. There are several reasons for which you might not sleep. Make sure your mattress is good and your bedroom dark. You should also talk about your sleeping problems with your doctor. You might be suffering from a condition such as sleep apnea.; , You don’t deal with stress as well as you used to and you feel more fragile. Each deadline is a source of major anxiety and you don’t know how to cope anymore. If you notice a negative evolution in your stress tolerance, it's probably time to act.   A lower tolerance to stress than usual is usually a sign of exhaustion or burnout.Don’t feel guilty and don’t lose faith in your ability to work if you’re more stressed than usual. We all have ups and downs. If you work in an abusive environment where the boss is using stress as a tool to increase productivity, a day off will not help. You should talk to your trade-union or HR and see if the law is on your side.  Those who know you the best, your family and friends, will probably notice if you're in desperate need for a break. Talk with them about your stress and ask them for their opinion. If you have a strong relationship, they will give you the best advice.Remember that communication is fundamental in a relationship. If you have been fighting with your partner recently, explain that you feel pressurised at work and are struggling. Let your partner express his/her feelings too. It’s important to realise that a stressed person is difficult to live with., A day off is ideal to relax but not enough when you have a serious physical or mental condition. You should talk to a doctor or a specialist if you suspect a depression or any other health issue.   Identify the signs. If you feel sad and down for weeks or months, you might be depressed. Depression is a real illness and has nothing to do with being weak.If you notice any unusual symptom, such as a rapid loss of weight, go immediately to your doctor.  Plan your mental health day during a slow time at work. Make sure your day off doesn’t bring stress on others. Check the calendar and your schedule to ensure your day off works for everyone.   Pick a Friday or a Monday if you don’t work during the week-end. Three days without working can do miracles.  Instead of saying that you are stressed, just tell your boss that you have a few important personal appointments or matters to address and would like the day off from work.   Be calm and confident in your approach and reassure him/her that you will have your work covered and/or deadlines met in time. Don’t pretend to be sick. If your boss doesn’t believe you, you might be in trouble. Don’t tell co-workers or clients that you need a mental health day. Some people are unfortunately intolerant toward health issues. Find a co-worker to back you up if there is an emergency at work and you’re needed. Consult with human resources to figure out how to categorize your day off. In some cases, the company may have actual mental health days built into your benefits - another reason why you should not feel guilty.  You might want to make the day off about you and only you. It shouldn’t be about fetching the little one at school or buying nappies. Discuss the planning in advance and make sure that everybody will respect your peace and quiet.   Offer to do more for the household before or after your day off to compensate. The key is respect and understanding. Tell your family not to call you on your mental health day, except in case of emergency. If you want, it’s also perfectly fine to spend your day with your family. It’s all about what you want!  , You want to make sure that your day off work is as relaxing as possible. A bit of preparation will help considerably. Make sure that you have all you need in advance. You don’t want to get stuck in a line at the supermarket’s cashier on your day off.   Make a list the day before and go buy what you need. Buy the essential, such as food and drinks, but don’t forget things that might make you happy. Make a schedule of your day and fit in priority what you would really want to do.  It’s better not to have any work at hand for your day off. Leave everything at your office place. Turn off your phone and avoid your emails.Make a resolution that you will not work and truly commit to taking your mental health care day seriously.   If you want to keep your phone turned on, make sure to turn off the emails to avoid any temptation.  If you've been exhausted or not sleeping, your day off should be spent in bed, resting your body and brain. You don’t need to sleep the whole time if you don’t want to, but you should definitely allow yourself to rest a few more hours than usual.Don’t forget to disconnect the alarm. Once you're awake, take a long and warm bath to relax your muscles. If doing chores and housework will make you feel a little saner on your day off, go for it. A mental health day doesn’t mean that you have to just sit around relaxing. In some cases, restoring order to your surroundings will bring you to a place of peace.  You’ve been working so much that you have eaten your sandwiches in front of your computer for the last four months. It’s time to go to a restaurant and enjoy a lazy lunch with a friend.   Go for a healthy meal and don't eat too much if you don't want to feel sleepy during the whole afternoon., Office work is stressful for the body and the spirit.There are several activities which will allow your muscles to stretch and your mind to relax. Here are a few suggestions:   There’s nothing like sport to make you spend some energy and stretch in a fun way. Try to pick a sport you like and avoid injuries! Go for a massage to feel truly relaxed and pampered. Aromatherapy is a good alternative. It is relatively cheap and can make you feel very good.  If work has taken you away from the ones you love, spend the day making time to be with those important folks. For example if you’ve been working endless hours, seven days a week and haven’t had a chance to spend time with your daughter, plan an entire day around what she wants to do.   You can also combine a few nice activities at the same time. Why not having a go at a good restaurant with your friends before heading for a massage with your family?  , If you're a workaholic, you will probably feel uncomfortable or guilty during your day off. Brush this feeling aside. Everybody deserves a day off once in a while and should be allowed to relax.   Remember that you need to care for yourself in order to continue being a productive worker and present parent/ family member. Things at the office will not fall apart if you're gone for one day. Getting a break can help you refuel and regain creativity to approach new problems.	Think about your sleeping pattern. Reflect on your stress tolerance. Discuss with your family and friends. Check that you're not suffering from a serious condition. Identify the right day. Plan with your boss and colleagues. Ask your family for peace. Determine what you will do in advance. Create a good resting environment. Catch up on sleep. Go for a nice meal. Relax your body. Reconnect with friends and family. Avoid any guilt.
Though popular music can sometimes seem cookie-cutter (especially lyrically) in fact, there is no single "right" way to write song lyrics. Great song lyrics have been penned from an incredibly wide variety of personal viewpoints that run the entire gamut of human experience. Some songs are cheerful, others are furious. Some songs are laid-back and relaxed, others are tense and paranoid. Some carry great personal significance for the writer, while others are about nothing at all. However, nearly all great songs convey some sort of emotion. For starters, when you write songs, try to express the way you feel when you think about certain topics, events, or people that are important to you. Your lyrics don't necessarily have to mention these things directly, though they certainly can.   Let's examine the opening lines of two songs - first, Elliott Smith's "Between the Bars" and, second, Kendrick Lamar's "Swimming Pools (Drank)". Both songs are about alcohol addiction. However, notice that they take two different approaches to the same topic, Smith opting for an indirect, referential approach and Lamar for a more direct one. Both successfully paint powerful emotional pictures.   Between the Bars: Drink up, baby, stay up all night/With the things you could do, you won't but you might/The potential you'll be that you'll never see/The promises you'll only make   Swimming Pools (Drank): Now I done grew up round some people living their life in bottles/Granddaddy had the golden flask backstroke every day in Chicago/Some people like the way it feels/Some people wanna kill their sorrows/Some people wanna fit in with the popular/That was my problem     , So, you've been thinking about things that make you feel strong emotions and writing down your thoughts in the form of lyrics. You're already off to a great start. Next, you'll need to organize your lyrics into some sort of song structure - decide which words go in the verse, which in the chorus, which in the bridge, and so on. Many popular songs have lyrics that rhyme - if you want your lyrics to rhyme, you'll also need to decide on a rhyme scheme (the pattern by which your rhymes are arranged).  Once you've written your lyrics and organized them into a song, it's time to start thinking about how you'd like your song to sound. Again, there's no right way to write a song, but you may find it easiest to figure out your instrumental parts before tackling your vocal melody - this way, you'll be able to fit your vocals to a solid instrumental backing, rather than custom-composing instrumental parts to fit your vocal melody. Naturally, try to compose instrumental accompaniments that compliment the emotions conveyed by your lyrics.   Songs' instrumental parts range in volume and intensity - some are overpowering "walls of sound", while others are so sparse that they're barely audible by comparison. For example, compare My Bloody Valentine's "Only Shallow" to Nirvana's "Polly". These two alternative rock songs were released within just months of each other, but their instrumentation couldn't be more different. "Only Shallow" is a massive, swirling juggernaut of distortion, while "Polly" is a dark, hushed composition, featuring just an acoustic guitar, Kurt Cobain's voice, a short bass interlude, and a few drum hits.  In much of popular music, the singer's vocals are the central feature of each song, supported by the instrumental backing. Now that you have your song's lyrics and instrumental parts figured out, it's time to set your words to music. Give your lyrics a melody, or, perhaps more accurately, melodies - most songs have related, but distinct melodies for verses, choruses, etc. Though some musicians use the concept of discord (conflict between the notes or chords in a piece of music) to great effect, generally, you'll want your vocal melody to be in an appropriate key for the chords of your song.   It's certainly not impossible to become successful writing and selling a cappella songs (songs with only vocals and no instruments) or purely instrumental recordings. For instance, Shai's version of "If I Ever Fall in Love" is an a cappella song that spent time at #2 on the US charts. Similarly, the recent explosion in popularity of electronic dance music has made hits out of songs with few (if any) lyrics. However, the vast majority of popular music has both instrumentals and lyrics, so writing these types of songs may give you more mass appeal. Note that, if you're writing rap songs, you generally won't have to worry about vocal melodies, as "pure" rap vocals are delivered tonelessly. However, many hip-hop artists incorporate tonality into their songs in the form of sung refrains or half-sung, half-rapped verses. See Chance the Rapper's "Juice" for an example of this technique.  Many popular songs with uninspiring verses, tepid instrumentals, and laughable lyrics are saved by the power of a tremendous chorus (sometimes called the "hook"). Try to make the chorus of your song a particularly poignant, expressive, and concise set of lines. Generally, the chorus is the part of a song that people will remember the best, so make it emblematic of your song as a whole. Another way to tackle this is to think of your hook as your song's "thesis statement" - if you had to sum up the emotions behind your song in a few musical lines, how would you do so?  , Above all else, when writing a song, try to imbue your work with passion both musically and lyrically. Your songs should make you, as a performer, feel strong emotions - if you find yourself bored by your music, don't be afraid to start from scratch. Music is just as much a craft as it is an art - it's something to be honed and perfected with plenty of practice. The best way to motivate yourself to work at your songwriting craft, of course, is to be truly passionate about it.  Though some musicians (like, famously, The Beatles) have been able to transition away from live performance in favor of dedicating themselves entirely to studio work, very few, if any, have been able to become widely-known in the first place without ever performing live. To start building an audience and gaining recognition as a musician, it's important to put in work as a live act. To start, look for opportunities to perform in your local area. Bars, clubs, and cafes are the "classic" proving grounds for up-and-coming musicians, but they're far from the only places where you can perform. Any place or occasion where people gather can conceivably be an opportunity to perform. Weddings, birthday parties, farmer's markets, and even street corners can be places to build your audience and sell your music.   Don't be afraid to start small - all but the luckiest musicians paid their dues as local acts before making it big. One semi-recent example is Lady Gaga, who become a fixture of several NYC bars and nightclubs for several years in the mid-00's before getting her shot at the spotlight.  Nearly all serious musical acts should spend some time in the recording studio. Generally, in the studio, artists partner with a producer or engineer to create a finished product that's to their satisfaction. Recording your music gives you the opportunity to distribute it to your fans (in physical form as a CD or online as a file) in a polished, definitive form that's exactly how you want it. It also gives you the opportunity to give your music to the types of people who can help you make money from your music - namely, record companies and industry scouts. If you haven't recorded any music yet, you may want to record a demo as your first move. Demos are short (about 3-6 tracks) "mini-albums" that give you a chance to showcase your musical style - think of them as musical resumes for prospective employers.    Meticulously practice your songs before you step into the studio. Studio time can be quite expensive, so you'll want to be able to record each song in as few takes as possible. The costs associated with lengthy studio sessions can quickly add up, so try to get to the point where you can play all of your songs in your sleep before you attempt to record them. For the same reason as you'll want to have your songs down pat before you enter the studio, you'll also want to avoid excessive experimentation in the studio. For instance, don't let a producer convince you to waste time trying out countless effects pedals. The place for experimentation and improvisation is in the practice room.  Booking your own shows and studio time, negotiating your own contracts, and distributing your own music is time-intensive and requires a great deal of expertise. Because of this, many dedicated musicians decide to hire the services of a professional manager or booking agent to handle the business aspects of the music industry. Though this option may not be feasible with the average starving artist's budget, it can help a promising young artist maximize his or her potential and rise within the industry. Be sure that your manager is established and reputable - don't fall prey to scam artists.  When you've begun to gather a following and you've recorded a demo or two, you may want to try to sell yourself to record companies to win a recording contract. Though large, international record companies occasionally sign artists that are relatively unknown in terms of mainstream airplay (see: Epic Records signing experimental hip hop group Death Grips), obscure and up-and-coming artists may have more luck when courting smaller independent labels. Research labels that release the type of music you're interested in selling. Then, if they have a policy of accepting unsolicited submissions, feel free to send them demos, photos, interviews, reviews, biographies, and the like (if sent all together, these types of materials compose what is called a press pack, a standard method artists use to distribute their work and propagate their image).   Of course, perhaps the best way to get noticed by a record company is to generate attention for yourself through groundbreaking music innovation, noteworthy live performances, and/or a unique image. In other words, if you're able to generate fame (or notoriety) without a record label, record labels may come to you.  Performing your own songs in a live setting is important, but this is only one of the ways that musicians can gain professional clout. Musical artists can (and should) also try to find work as session musicians, soundtrack composers, and more - any opportunity to contribute music to another person's project or endeavor is chance to spread your name.   One oft-overlooked opportunity for artists to create original music for profit is in the world of jingle-writing. Advertising agencies regularly employ musicians to compose and perform songs for commercials. In fact, several music production houses (called "jingle houses") specialize in the process, using in-house musicians to create jingles for their clients.Especially when starting out, musicians may not have the luxury of being able to be picky with their employers. Don't worry too much about "selling out" - in some respects, it's part of the process of making your name as a musician. In fact, many now-famous performers with anti-authority bents originally took part in more "commercially friendly" music endeavors. Case in point: Tupac Shakur was originally a member of the light-hearted hip-hop group Digital Underground (of "Humpty Dance" fame).  Music is a more competitive field today than ever before. With the advent of online music retail sources, contemporary musicians don't just have to compete with each other, but also with the stars of ages past whose music is just as available to consumers as their own. To stand the best chance of being able to sell yourself as a musician, it's important to make sure that you stand out from the pack of modern artists. Don't make music or perform in ways that can cause you to be confused with another artist. Instead, break the mold and forge an artistic image that's uniquely yours.   This advice extends to your music itself as well as to the way you perform. Take pride in the flourishes and idiosyncrasies that are unique to your performance. Many successful musicians, like Prince, Michael Jackson, Freddie Mercury, and countless others, had and/or have performance styles that are unforgettably indelible. The clothes you wear, the way you carry yourself onstage, and the way you play your songs all combine to create your image as a performer, so take time to develop these aspects of yourself as an artist.  Whether you're playing live shows or trying to move copies of your latest album, it's almost always in your best interest to reach out to as many people as possible. Advertise yourself as a musician using every method at your disposal - word of mouth (for instance, if you teach music part-time, try telling your students about an upcoming concert at the end of their lessons), self-advertising (flyers, etc.), and even cross-promotion with local radio stations are great ideas for promoting yourself. Also be sure to take advantage of your online visibility. Nowadays, a well-timed social media "push" can be a much more effective and efficient way to reach your fan base than conventional advertising.   The humble flyer is a well-worn method by which musicians self-promote. These can be easily massed-produced for relatively cheap with nothing more than a basic computer and a printer. Be sure your flyer includes any information your audience will need to attend your upcoming event - time, place, date, and admission price are essential. Also ensure your flyer is somewhere it will be noticed, such as a live music venue, bar, coffee shop, or college campus.  No matter how good they are, your songs won't ever sell themselves. Use every performance as an opportunity to sell songs - either by reminding your audience that you have physical CDs for sale or by directing them to a personal webpage, etc. Don't shrink from selling your music. If you put on a good show, you deserve whatever money you make from selling your music - you're not selling out by giving your audience the chance to support you.   The internet offers plenty of exciting opportunities for musicians to share and sell their music. Social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter let musicians keep in touch with their fans and notify them of new songs and live performances. Also, sites such as GarageBand and Soundcloud offer the opportunity for artists to host and even sell their actual music online.  Some recent artists have actually managed to become breakout successes primarily through the internet. For instance, Justin Bieber's path to stardom began when a record industry executive accidentally clicked one of Bieber's online videos by accident.  You have probably noticed that, today, most of the songs on the radio sound somewhat alike in terms of their sleek, flawless production style. This is a deliberate choice on the part of the songs' creators. A song's production values are a serious factor to consider before releasing it to the public - minor flaws like missed notes, background noise, and noticeable transitions between separate takes can become glaringly obvious with repeated listens. Though there's certainly a market for music with a lo-fi aesthetic, the market for sleek, polished recordings is undeniably bigger. So, at the very least, be sure to consider whether your music's production values suit your professional goals.   Some musicians have the experience and know-how to produce their own music - Kanye West and some of his peers in the world of hip-hop, for instance, produce many of their own songs. However, many musicians don't know how to "work the boards", so to speak. If you fall into this group, consider paying for studio time with a professional producer, who will be able to help you record and mix your music as professionally as possible.  Unfortunately, the music industry has a history of taking advantage of well-meaning musicians' kindness. Always be aware that unsavory tour managers, record labels, venue owners, concert promoters, and the like may be out to get you. Never let someone you don't know entangle you in a vague or poorly-defined agreement. Don't agree to work for free as a musician for the "possibility" of pay at a later date. Don't exchange your self-agency for the promise of fame. Don't let any managers or staff you employ make decisions for you without your consent. As a general rule, try to remain guarded as you navigate the music industry. Though many of the people in the industry are completely honest and ethical, all it takes is one legally-binding agreement with a bad apple to completely sideline your music career.   Contracts are a must. Oral agreements, even with people you're close with, aren't easily enforced. Always get any agreement you make in writing. If you're being asked to sign a significant binding agreement (like, for instance, a record deal), get the counsel of an experienced lawyer before signing.	Write lyrics with emotional meaning. Give your song a sense of structure. Compose instrumental backing music for your song. Set your lyrics to a melody. Pay special attention to your song's chorus or hook. Be passionate. Play live gigs. Record your music. Consider enlisting the help of a manager. Reach out to record companies. Look for unconventional opportunities to sell yourself as a musician. Build a distinct image. Promote yourself. Market your songs in-person and online. Pay attention to the production values of your music. Never let the industry take advantage of you.
The ideal temperature for older books is below tween 65 and 72 degrees Fahrenheit (18 to 22 degrees Celsius).The ideal humidity level is around 35%.Conditions that are too dry can cause your old, rare books to become brittle, but excessive moisture could lead to mold or foxing (the specks, splotches, and other forms of discoloration that often afflict old books).  Ultraviolet light fades the inks and dyes used in many books, especially in older works. Exposing a rare antique book to constant sunlight will cause considerable discoloration within a few short days., Place your old, rare books in unsealed acid-free polyethylene bags.Invest in a bookshelf with a glass door to further protect them from dust., Remove a fragile book from the bookshelf by tilting it backwards and easing it out of place from the front or top sides of the book. Do not remove the book from the top of its spine, since this is the most fragile part of any book. Ease the book open rather than forcing it, since force will likely cause stiff pages to come unbound., Even old, rare books can be stored on bookshelves and actually do well when stored this way as long as the humidity, temperature, and light conditions of the room are managed well. Keeping the books in a vertical position not only saves space but ensures that each book does not have to support the weight of any other book., The weight of large, heavy books put pressure on the spine, causing pages to slowly pull away. Avoid stacking too many of these larger, heavy books on top of one another, though, since stacking more than two or three such books puts too much pressure on the bottom book., The books should be packed securely enough to prevent them from tumbling over, but not so tightly that they are difficult to remove. Leaving a small gap between books both allows you to remove them with ease when you wish to and allows for greater air circulation between the books. This will prevent unnecessary friction or stress caused by squeezing one book against another.	Monitor the temperature and humidity of your storage location. Keep the books away from strong light. Protect your books from dust. Handle the books with care. Store most books on shelves. Store heavy books on their sides. Shelve your books securely, but leave a little wiggle room.
The drop, cover, and hold on technique is the cousin of the famous "stop, drop and roll" for fires. While it's not the only method of protecting yourself indoors during an earthquake, it is the preferred method of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the American Red Cross.Big earthquakes occur without much, if any, warning, so it's recommended that you drop to the floor as soon as it hits. A small earthquake could turn into a big earthquake in a split-second; it's better to be safe than sorry.; , Get under a sturdy table or other piece of furniture. If possible, stay away from glass, windows, outside doors and walls, and anything that could fall, such as lighting fixtures or furniture. If there isn’t a table or desk near you, cover your face and head with your arms and crouch in an inside corner of the building.    Do not: Run outside. You're more likely to get injured trying to get out of the building than staying put.Head for a doorway. Hiding under a doorway is a myth.You're safer under a table than you are under a doorway, especially in modern houses. Run to another room to get under a table or other piece of furniture.  Researchers have shown that most injuries happen when people try to change the place of hiding or when the place is crowded and everyone has a goal to get outside safe., The ground may be shaking and debris could be falling. Hold on to whatever surface or platform you've gotten under and wait for the shaking to subside. If you were unable to find a surface to hide under, continue to keep your head shielded by your arms and tucked down low.  Hold on and protect your head with a pillow, unless you are under a heavy light fixture that could fall. In that case, move to the nearest safe place.   Many injuries are caused when people leave their bed and walk across broken glass with their bare feet., Research suggests that many injuries occur when people inside buildings attempt to move to a different location inside the building or try to leave.   Be careful when you do go outside. Walk, do not run, in case of violent aftershocks. Collect yourself in an area without wires, buildings, or crevasses in the earth. Do not use elevators for egress. The power can go out, causing you to be trapped. Your best bet is to use the stairwell if it's free.	Drop to the ground. Take cover. Stay inside until it's safe to get out. Hold on. If you find yourself in bed while an earthquake strikes, stay there. Stay inside until shaking stops and it is safe to go outside.
There are 2 common types suitable for home use: hinge-mounted and fixed post (also known as wall mounted). Hinge-mounted doorstops remain out of the way and don't require drilling any holes into your wall. Fixed post doorstops require you to drill into your wall to mount them, and are best suited for heavy doors.  Hinge-mounted doorstops consist of a small metal body, 2 rubber pads (1 of which is adjustable), and a metal ring. They are readily available at hardware stores and will fit nearly any door.  Close the door on which you are installing the stop, and use a flat-head screwdriver to pry the hinge pin out of the top hinge. Place the tip of the screwdriver underneath the flared top of the hinge pin, and use the screwdriver as a lever to force it out.  Align the doorstop so that the adjustable rubber pad faces the wall, and the fixed pad sits flush against the door. Hammer the hinge pin back into place.  Twist the threaded rod attached to the adjustable pad to determine how far the door can be opened. This may require a flat-head screwdriver, or you may be able to grab the pad in your fingers and twist it.  Fixed post doorstops consist of a short, rigid post with a rubber pad on 1 end. The other end is affixed to your wall or baseboard, usually by drilling a hole and threading the stop into the hole.; , Using a pencil, mark the point on the baseboard that lines up with the edge of the door. Now mark a second point that is 1.5 inches (38 mm) from this point, towards the door's hinges. Be careful not to mark the point further away from the edge of the door than this, because if the doorstop is installed there it could punch a hole through a hollow-core door.  Using a drill with a 1/8 inch (3 mm) bit, drill a hole into your baseboard where you drew the second pencil mark.  The doorstop will have 1 side with a threaded screw protruding from it; screw this end into the hole you drilled by rotating it clockwise until it is flush with the wall.	Decide what type of doorstop you want to install. Buy the doorstop(s). Pry the top hinge pin out. Fit the hinge pin through the ring on the doorstop. Adjust the doorstop to allow the desired opening distance. Buy the doorstop(s). Open your door until it is parallel with the wall. Drill a hole into the baseboard to mount the doorstop. Screw the doorstop into the hole.
The string should be the length that you want the radius of the alpine wheel to be, from its center to one edge. This forms a simple compass, where one stick stays in the center while you pull out the other stick to make the string taut and walk around marking a circle, keeping the string taut at all times. Drop marker rocks or similar to define the circle as you go, or simply draw the circle in the dirt with a stick if the soil allows for this.; ,, Add compost, fertilizer, etc., to improve the soil as you'd do normally. Depending on the plants you're adding, adjust the soil improvers as required. , Divide the circle into 8 even divisions. Using the bricks, place them in lines from the center to the circle's edge. Push the bricks down about halfway into the soil, leaving a tiny edge to form a mini wall alongside each division.  Place a ring of bricks around the outer edge of the circle to define its end. Again, only push about halfway down, leaving the rest sitting up above the soil.  Or, if you're adding herbs, plant as many as will be suitable for the amount of herbs you have. Go for variety, planting a different kind of plant in each division; it will look more interesting when it has grown.  Pat down gently. Water as needed.  Take care not to tip gravel onto the actual plants. If wished, you can skip this step if you don't think it'll help the plants.  Place interesting pebbles or rocks in and around the plants to add a final touch of interest to the alpine wheel. Don't overdo this; less is usually best.  Tend to it regularly to prevent weeds from taking over. Keep adequately watered.	Tie the two ends of string to the pieces of wood. Use the string compass to map out a circle for the alpine wheel.  , Dig over the alpine wheel area. Place the circular object of choice at the center of the wheel.  , Make the spokes. Complete the circle's edge. Plant about three alpine plants per division, spaced evenly apart. Fill the dirt in neatly around the newly planted plants. Place gravel on each division. Add pebble or rock features. Admire the finished alpine wheel.

You'll need to loosen the string that you want to set to relieve tension on the string as you work on other steps. You don't have to remove the strings completely but loosen them enough so that you have room to work under them on the neck., The guitar nut is on the top of your neck, near the headboard. It's what the strings are pulled over before they are wrapped around the tuning pegs. Find a screw that's about the same height as the guitar nut and one that can fit snugly under the strings of your guitar. You may have to search around at a hardware store until you find the right sized screw., Cut off a piece of the screw by bending it back and forth with needle nose pliers. You need the piece of the screw to be small enough so that it can fit under a particular string but not affect the rest of the strings on your neck., This piece of metal will affect the strings intonation. The higher that you slide the screw towards the nut the higher your pitch will be. The closer that you slide the screw to the fret, towards the bridge, the lower or flatter the note will be. Continue to adjust the metal until your note is in tune.	Loosen the string that you need to adjust. Find a screw that's the same height as the guitar nut. Break the screw into a quarter inch (0.63 cm) piece. Slide the screw under the string between the first fret and the nut.
Suppose you see a really cool Camaro, Mustang or some other collectible car drive by. Make a note of as much descriptive information as you can get.  With a simple Internet search for “car clubs,” you will be able to find listings of clubs dedicated to car enthusiasts., If you have this additional information, you will have a better chance of finding the particular car and owner you are looking for., Some car club sites will list owners by name and include contact information.With a little luck, you’ll find the person you want.	Identify the type of car. Look up car clubs online. Narrow your search by the style or year of the car. Look for owners in your area.
Dwarf ornamental peppers work best for indoor growing, since many of the large varieties may not have adequate room for their roots to develop in indoor containers.; , Clays like terra cotta can actually draw moisture out of the soil, especially in the warm, bright conditions required for growing chili peppers. These peppers need a lot of moisture to grow and may dehydrate in a clay pot.  While chili peppers thrive on vast amounts of water, a drainage hole prevents too much excess water from gathering and drowning or rotting the roots.  Many containers, especially if previously used, contain hidden bacteria and insect eggs that can sabotage new plant life. Wash your container out with hot water and soap to eliminate most threats.  Garden soil often contains bacteria that can damage your pepper seeds, preventing germination or hindering growth. A multi-purpose compost mix purchased from a local gardening store should do the trick, but the higher quality soil you use, the better your odds are of successfully growing your plants.   Improve the quality of your soil further by mixing in some vermiculite.	Select your chili pepper variety. Opt for a plastic pot over a clay container. Choose a pot with a drainage hole. Sterilize the pot before use. Purchase potting mix.
This technique is great for mermaid parties and easy to make. All you need is beach towels, ribbons, and rubber bands.   Thicker rubber bands will work better for this design. The ribbon needs to be long enough to fit around your future mermaid’s waist., Place the towel, preferably a beach towel, around the mermaid’s waist. The towel should droop down like a long dress. , Tie a ribbon around the mermaid’s waist. Use the same knot you’d use to tie a shoe. You don’t want to suffocate the mermaid, but make sure it doesn’t slip off., Wrap a rubber band around the last foot of the towel. Leave the rubber band in the center of the towel on your last wrap around. This will produce fins out of the last foot of the towel.	Gather your materials. Position the towel. Secure the towel. Create the tail.
There's no surefire way to start writing a song, but most people start with either a guitar riff or a vocal melody. Starting with a melody usually involves playing around with some chords on the guitar and singing over it until you find a melody you like. This can be the start of either the verse or the chorus of your song. Starting with a riff usually involves working on the guitar until you come up with a good metal riff, something that's both catchy and driving.; , A metal song, like rock and pop, is usually made up of a combination of verse, chorus, and bridge, with an optional intro and outro. You'll need to work with your rhythm guitarist to create a structure based around the original riff or melody you came up with. Create a chord progression for your verse and chorus, and decide if the song needs a bridge.The basic song structure of rock and metal songs goes: intro, verse, chorus, verse, solo, chorus, chorus, outro.  After your song has a basic structure, it's time to add drums and bass. There isn't really any trick to this, other than jamming through the song with your drummer, rhythm guitarist, and bassist until your drummer and bassist have a sense of the song and what kind of beats and bass lines will work in each part.Metal bass tends to follow the chord structure closely, valuing rhythm over melody. But you aren't limited to that. Experiment with bass lines that follow the vocals, follow the lead, or do something completely different, but complementary.  If you've got a lead guitarists, now is the time to add some lead guitar melodies to your song. It's best to try to find guitar melodies that compliment the vocal melody, and don't get in the way of it.  Metal music deals with a wide variety of topics when it comes to lyrics. You can write about just about any subject. A good general rule of thumb for writing metal lyrics is to keep the themes simple, and the imagery and metaphors interesting.Consider, for example, this verse by Vastum, “Our depths of joy in this saturation / In our polymorphously perverse constitution / The dissolution of our grief comes in libidinal death and the grace of mourning”. It deals with simple themes of sexuality, but uses verbose and unusual language. Consider the interesting use of extended metaphor in the song Anomalistic Offerings by Suffocation, "The pain is unbearable, but you continue making the incision / With drill in hand, you find the seed of the demon inside / Blood spews over the walls as you drill deeper," in which cranial surgery is a metaphor for battling inner demons.  Once you've got all the parts of your song in place, the structure, the melodies, the riffs, the drums, and bass, it's time to start practicing. Work on the song until the band is tight together. As you play the song, listen for places you can make improvements. Talk over your ideas about the song with the band and change it as you all see fit.   Record the band playing the song so you can listen to it more closely. That way you can spend time analyzing the individual aspects of the song on your own time.  You can write songs without a band, but it's harder, especially for metal. Metal has a lot going on in it instrumentally, so you'll likely find writing it on your own difficult. But you can at least start the song before forming the band. And if you're multi-instrumental, meaning you have some skill with all the instruments in a metal band, you can even write the whole thing yourself if you want to.   If you want to write the song by yourself before forming a band, you'll need access to drums, a guitar, a bass, and recording equipment, at least a microphone and a computer. Then you just follow the song composing steps one by one, recording each part before moving on to the next. If you want to start writing a song before forming a band, you can write just the rhythm guitar and vocal melody of the song. That will give the song a solid base that can be built upon once you've got some bandmates.  Before you form a band, you need to decide how many members you want, and what instruments everyone will play. Usually metal bands consist of a drummer, as bassist, a vocalist (who may also play guitar/bass) and two guitarists, one as rhythm and the other as lead. Most bands follow this type of line up but you don’t have to have this. You could have one guitarist or no bassist for example. It's up to you., There are a number of ways to find people to be in your band. The easiest and often most effective way is to join with people you're already friends with, who have musical skill and instruments.Another way to find band members is to place an ad on a site like craigslist. Make a posting explaining your mission to form a band, what kind of music you want to play, and what roles you're looking to fill.  There are certain characteristics you need to look for when recruiting and members. Your fellow members need to have similar tastes in music, not identical, but similar. You also need to find people who have similar levels of skill, otherwise you might have one member who holds back the rest. It's also important that everyone in the band gets along with each other. If there's some serious personality clashing in your band, it won't last very long.  There's a wide range of sub genres within the metal genre, so it's best to pin point your style before you start. You can choose anything from black metal to grind core. Make sure all of your band members agree on a style. Some popular metal sub-genres include:Death metal, which is characterized by down-tuned guitars playing fast, intricate rhythms along with growled vocals and dark subject matter. Power metal, which is characterized by fast tempos, melodic harmonies, and clean vocals. Black metal, which is characterized by cold atmospheres, satanic imagery, and raspy, harsh vocals.  It's going to be hard to write songs in a particular style without being very familiar with that style. It's likely you've already listened to plenty of music in the style you're interested in, but it will help greatly if you expand your knowledge and try to find more artists who play in that style. The more familiar you are with the conventions and particulars of a certain style, the easier it will be to start writing good metal songs.  While no formal music education is required to write a good metal song, knowledge of music theory can only help you. You can research online to find resources for learning about the basics of music theory.	Start with either a melody or a riff. Build the song's structure. Add drums and bass. Add lead guitar optionally. Write the lyrics. Practice the song and work out the details. Consider whether to make a band before or after you start writing. Decide on what instruments you want. Look for band members. Find people who have a similar vision. Pinpoint type of metal you want to play. Listen to a lot of your preferred genre. Study music theory.
Sometimes, while riding, the chain will slip off of its intended path, but not break. Because, in this case, the chain is still routed through both the front and rear derailleurs, no special maintenance is needed - all you'll usually need to do is slip the chain back onto its sprocket. When you experience a slippage, get off the bike and look for the slippage. Usually, the chain falls off of the front sprocket, but stays threaded through both derailleurs.   Look for places where the chain has become jammed against the frame - these jams must be addressed before the bike can be ridden again.; , Sometimes, in the event of a slippage, the chain gets jammed between the rear sprocket and the frame. In this case, it's a good idea to loosen the quick release on the rear wheel and undo the wheel nut to loosen the rear wheel from the chain. When you've loosened the rear wheel enough, simply pull the chain out.   Open the quick release by first pulling the small lever at the center of the rear wheel. Then, loosen the wheel nut on the other side to loosen the "hold" the rear wheel has on the frame. Once loosened, the chain should come out easily. Don't forget to re-tighten the quick release before riding away. You should be able to close it completely - it should be tight, but not too tight to push all the way down. If it feels too tight, loosen the wheel nut and try again. Likewise, if it's too loose, then tighten the wheel nut.  For bikes with rear derailleurs, simply slacken the chain and thread it around the front sprocket. On most bikes, the rear derailleur is spring loaded so that it keeps the chain tight while riding. Take advantage of this fact by pushing the arm of the rear derailleur forward to introduce slack in the chain. Then, use this slack to thread the other end of the chain around the smallest of the front sprockets. Release the arm of the rear derailleur and ensure the chain is tight.   From here, you can usually simply ride away! Your bike may shift somewhat erratically until the chain shifts into the gear it was in when the slippage occurred.  For bikes without a derailleur, catch the chain on the sprocket by pedaling. Many bikes (like "fixies") don't have derailleurs. The easiest way to repair a loose chain in this case is to hook the chain onto the rear sprocket, hook as much of the chain as you can on the bottom of the front sprocket, and carefully turn the pedal backwards. The chain should "catch" and begin to turn around the front sprocket. When the "caught" portion gets to the top of the front sprocket, the chain should begin running through the bike's gears as normal.   Turning the pedals is easier if you elevate the bike's rear wheel. To do so, you can put the bike on a stand or prop up the rear of the frame with any materials on hand. Alternatively, you may get a helper to hold the rear wheel off the ground as you put the chain back on or turn the entire bike upside down.  Get on your bike and pedal forward at a slow speed. If your bike has gears, your chain may "jump" back into the gear it was in when the slippage occurred. Otherwise, keep changing gear until the chain pedals smoothly.   Note - on fixed-gear bikes, chain slippage can be particularly dangerous and problematic and is often the symptom of a chain that's too loose. Consider adjusting the tension in your chain before riding again.  Before you resume normal riding, make sure you are in a comfortable gear. If your bike has them, change gears on both the rear and front derailleurs until your chain turns smoothly without producing any noise.	Find the slippage. Use the quick release if the chain is jammed. Loosen the chain if your bike has a rear derailleur. Turn the pedals on a bike without a derailleur. Pedal forward gently until the bike is in the right gear. Perform some final checks.
It can either be a classic kung fu fight like the Bruce Lee or Matrix movies or Krav Maga like Bourne Ultimatum or Boxing like Rocky.; , If you are shooting a kung fu fight, make sure the person can pull off high kicks and knows at least a couple of takedowns, etc. If he doesn't, get someone who has trained in the art to teach him  , Create pauses in the fight after every few seconds and register the fighters expressions by zooming into his face etc.Get your fighter to make funny wah wah or "hiyah" sounds . It adds to the feel of the fight.  Only boxing punches in a fight is really boring.Include the high kicks frequently,the takedown now and then.Do not just show one person getting beaten up. Include blocks,parries,rolls and weapons if possible  , You can show cool kicks in slow motion or speed up Punches to make it look like Bruce Lee  , Choose a suitable setting and make sure the fight is performed throughout the setting for eg if you choose to include a staircase on the setting or a swimming pool. Make part of the fight take place on the staircase or in the water	Decide what kind of fight you want it to be. Make sure that the person you cast, if not having had training in that particular martial art, can at least pull off some of the moves. While shooting, do not make the fight continuous. Make sure you have some funky moves in your fight. Speed or slow down the camera shot to give a feel to a particular move. Finally make sure you film the fight from all angles possible.
The installation method has changed within the last few years. If you have older models, you will need to presoak your filter in for 15 minutes in a glass of water.   For all recently purchased filters, follow the remaining instructions.; , Wash your Brita pitcher with soap and water if you haven’t done so in the last few weeks.  Unwrap your Brita pitcher filter.  Let cold water run over your filter for 15 seconds.  Run water over the top of the carafe and filter. Repeat every 40 gallons (151.4 L) or two months.	Read the instructions on the Brita water filter cartridge packaging. Remove the old filter and discard it. Wash your hands with soap and water. Turn on the tap. Insert the new filter.
If you pick the plant bare, it'll stay that way. Always choose certain stalks and leave others to produce more growth for the next harvest.; , Parsley doesn't like drying out, so the warmer the weather, the more attention you need to give it by watering sufficiently.  Lob off the beginning flower heads to prevent them from taking. Once they're growing, all the plant's energy is directed to the flowers and your culinary leaf stock will die back and stop being luscious.  Apply liquid manure or a suitable fertiliser to encourage more growth. Keep up regular applications.   Try sulphate of ammonia: 1 tablespoon to 5 liters (1.3 US gal) of water. Add to the soil (not the leaves) and water in well.	Harvest parsley generously but never completely. Keep watered during hot weather. Prevent the parsley from flowering. Give the plant a booster.
This bowl can be plastic, aluminum, or steel, but it should NOT be made of lead. Put this bowl on a sunny surface outside.  The cup or bowl should be shorter than the edges of the large bowl.  Fill the large bowl with water but do not go over the edge of the small bowel or cup.  Cover the bowl very tightly with plastic wrap. Use tape or rubber bands to ensure a tight seal.  This should be right over your cup or bowl and should angle the plastic down. Make sure the plastic does not touch the cup, though. A good weight to use would be a rock.  The sun will evaporate the water in the large bowl, causing the water vapor to rise and condense on the plastic. Since the plastic is weighted and angled, the condensation will roll down into your cup. Mmmm! Clean water!	Get a fairly deep, large bowl. Put a cup or small bowel in the larger bowl. Fill the large bowl with water. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Place a weight at the center of the plastic. Wait for your water.
An effective way to avoid caterpillars is to encourage birds to make their home in your yard. While this may not be an ideal solution for gardeners that want to keep the local avians away from their berry patch, it will certainly work for gardeners with plants that don’t appeal to the bird’s taste buds. To get birds to come to your yard:   Set out a bird feeder with a cone around it to keep out hungry squirrels and a birdbath to encourage the local avian populace to visit. Ducks and chickens also enjoy caterpillars and if one has the space they might add either for both bug control and the tasty eggs.  Placing mugwort, sage, thyme, rosemary, and/or peppermint* around affected plants may remedy some caterpillar problems. These strongly scented herbs will help disguise the creature’s favorite foods so that they head elsewhere for dinner.Intercropping, or placing different plants together in one area, is another way to confuse insect predators.  There are several organic controls that can be used to get rid of caterpillars. BT, or Bacillus thuringiensis, is an excellent option for keeping pests out of the yard. However, this substance is not always easy to find.To use BT:   “Kurstaki” BT kills most species of caterpillars. Mix it up according to the manufacturer’s instructions and spray the plants thoroughly, covering the tops and bottoms of the leaves as well as the stems. It can be sprayed on flowers and landscape plants every three to five days until the caterpillars are under control. Gardeners who cannot find BT should try Neem based sprays instead. These sprays should only be used as a last resort because a number of beneficial insects may perish along with the caterpillars.	Encourage birds to spend time in your yard. Hide plants by using strongly scented herbs. Use organic controllers to rid your yard of caterpillars.

Start by running the dryer for 10 minutes. This will soften the lipstick and make it easier to remove. You can alternatively use a hairdryer to heat up the specific spot which is being affected. This may be easier and more efficient to do.  With the drum hot, wipe the lipstick with a soft, dry cloth. Switch which part of the cloth you wipe with frequently, to keep from spreading the lipstick any more.   You can also try using a makeup wipe to remove the lipstick.  Unplug the dryer and then soak a cotton ball with rubbing alcohol. Use this to wipe off the remaining lipstick. When you've removed as much of it as you can, rinse with a wet rag or paper towels.  With the dryer rinsed out, run a load of old towels through a cycle in the dryer to remove any product which might still remain.	Warm the dryer. Wipe off as much as you can. Clean out the remaining product with rubbing alcohol. Run a cycle with old towels.
Creeping Charlie, like other plants, needs light for growth. However, this plant can survive even in low level light, like strong shade. Because of this, if you intend to use this method, the light must be completely blocked to the plant., There are many items you could use for this purpose. For example, you could lay down a large piece of cardboard, a heavy drop-cloth, or a tarp over top the plant for maximum light blockage.   When creeping charlie is growing among plants you want to keep, you might consider cutting a circular hole around in a heavy cloth or tarp. This way you can block light to the creeping charlie around the wanted plant without denying it of light. Any surrounding plants that are deprived of light will die along with the creeping charlie. This likely means you'll need to reseed your plot later., Stray wind, animals, or other environmental factors can cause your light cover to shift in position. Stabilize your light cover by heaping some soil, rocks, or some other kind of weight on top of it to hold it in place.   To ensure the light is completely blocked, you should make sure that the cardboard is large enough to cover at least six inches beyond any protruding stems., In many cases, a week of light deprivation will cause the creeping charlie to wither and die, though depending on soil richness and other factors this can take longer. Peek under your light cover periodically to check whether or not the creeping charlie has died.   When you notice that all parts of the creeping charlie are withered, shriveled, and lacking in green color, the plant should be dead., There is a risk of creeping charlie reseeding even after the plant has died. In order to prevent regrowth, you should gather up all of its plant matter, including roots, and dispose of it by throwing it away or burning.   Be sure you wear gloves when handling or removing creeping charlie directly. Many people are allergic to this plant.Many places require you to request a burning permit to prevent false fire alarms. Be sure you have a burning permit before attempting to dispose this plant with fire.	Starve the planted of sunlight. Cover the area affected with creeping charlie. Protect your light cover from disturbance. Wait until the plant dies. Remove the plant and clear the area of remains.
Being a plant native to South Africa, tritoma does the best in hot environments. Planting the seeds in May or June allows them just enough time to develop before the temperatures elevate. Then, they will begin to bloom in the hottest months of the summer., If you choose to grow your tritoma inside, then make sure to keep the temperature set in the 70-75 degree Fahrenheit range. Peat pots are a particularly good planting container as they will provide both structure and nutrients.If you don’t have a peat pot available, almost any container will do. It just needs to be clean and have a depth of at least 3 inches to give plenty of room for root growth.  If you decide to grow indoors and then transplant outside, it will take about 7-8 weeks before the plants are ready to move. Make sure to transplant only after the final frost of the season to give the seedlings some time to get established. By this time your seedlings will stand around 2 inches tall.You can also tell that the seedlings are ready to move by looking at their leaves. They should have at least four full leaves. To transplant, grasp the seedling by the leaves, as the stem is too fragile. Use a spoon to loosen up the soil around the base. Apply a bit of pressure and lift the seedling and its roots out of the soil., This depth will provide protection from the elements, but it is also just deep enough for the seeds to still make it to the surface. Rhizomes, sprouts, or divided bulbs can be placed just slightly deeper at 7 cm because they are a bit hardier., Since tritoma can grow to be rather tall, it will need plenty of air circulation around it without being overshadowed by other plants. Ideally, try to plant each tritoma at least 20 inches apart. If the plants seem to grow closer together you can always thin them out later, too.Providing plenty of room for air circulation will lessen the possibility of your tritoma getting “damping off,” a fungus that breaks down the plant at the soil line., To keep your planting areas looking alive and active, place your tritomas alongside other plants that flower in the late summer months. Marigolds, in particular, work well with tritomas as they are low to the ground and easy to care for. The colors are also complementary with the red of the tritomas playing off of the orange and yellows in the marigolds.	Plant in the early summer. Start with indoor pots. Transplant the seedlings at 2 inches. Put the seeds at least 6mm deep. Leave at least 20 inches between plants. Pair them with other late-summer foliage.
Find a tint shop that has been in business for 5 or more years at the same location. This shows a stable business that will be there years down the road if somehow the tint goes bad.       Often times, successful tint shops open car tinting branches in neighboring cities. Although the installers of the branches may not be the master tint of the bunch, since opening new shops means training new employees; however, branches are a sure sign of a successful tinting business.      ; ,   Quality tint shops carry complete lines of window film from one or multiple window film manufacturers. They should carry dyed, hybrid, and metallic in a variety of colors and darkness. Beware of tint shops that only carry one or two lines of film, and sells them aggressively. They may have acquired this film on sale, and may not be thinking of your unique requirements and concerns.       The warranty on the car tint varies depending on the window film you choose. Try to install only window film backed with a lifetime warranty for materials and labor. Most films don't guarantee color and fading, it is recommended that you also choose one that does.       For the warranty to take effect, check out the window tint laws for your state. Illegal tint can nullify any manufacturer's warranty. When you purchase your tint, be sure sure you get a manufacturer's warranty card from the dealer with the date, the window film used on each window, and the total cost of installation as well as the receipt.    Tint shops can sound like the best shop on the phone, but 15 minutes on-site should tell you all you need to know.       Good dealers pay attention to customer service. They should be happy and willing to spend the time to talk to you and explain how their shops work. Remember, if they don't spend time with you now, they might not spend time with you when something goes wrong with your tint job down the road.       A tint shop's work area should be indoors and clean. Their tools and window films are organized in a professional manner. If the tint shop is outdoors or in a parking lot, this is a negative since it is critical to remove all dust and dirt from the windows before applying window film.       Take a look at a car they have already tinted, and look at the rear window. Is the window film applied in a single piece or is it cut into strips that surround the defroster lines. The best tint shops always apply film in a single piece. Look at the borders of the rear window, in many cars there is a black 'frit' edge on the window, Make sure the window film is securely attached to the frit as well.       Look for slices in window gasket material inside and out.       Look for nicks in the paint around the windows.       Pay attention to side-windows. The window film should be applied to the inside and be completely flush against all 4 edges of the window. Now look at the window film itself. Don't worry if the film looks slightly streaky and discolored, window film takes a couple weeks to dry out and become completely clear. If there are bubbles of air under the film or the film itself is not complete flat against the window, this is a sure sign of sloppy tinting.  Never compromise because there are plenty of other dealers out there that will offer your perfect tint. With these price quotes and your research on each tint shop, make the decision.  Even if they say "drop-ins accepted" or "bring it over any time", you want your tinter to be calm and prepared for you when you arrive. Tinting may take a couple hours to half a day, so either arrange a ride or go to a nearby coffee shop with a good book. Enjoy!	Find out how long they have been in business at this location   Good tint shops prosper despite local competition by offering good service at reasonable prices. Inquire about the types of film they carry, and what type of warranty they offer. Try to visit a few tint shops to see a sample of their work. Get price quotes from a few dealers for the exact darkness, color, and type of window film you want. Make your decision and then remember to make an appointment with the tint shop before you tint your car.
Immediately after a spill, clean up any excess spilled milk that is still wet or visible. This will help to remove spoiled milk smells from inside a car and make it easier to clean later on.Use paper towels, a white wash cloth, or a sponge and press it against any fabric or upholstery where milk has spilled. Continue padding the area until you have soaked up all of the moisture.; , Any fabric or area that has a spill on it and can be removed, should.Floor mats without plastic or rubber can be washed in a household washing machine. Spray the mats with a stain remover, and put them in the washing machine on warm. All other materials should be sprayed with a hose or washed in a tub with water and soap. Let the mats air dry in the house or outside in the sun.  Use a deep cleaning or steam cleaning vacuum to get deep-set spoiled milk odors out of your car. Many steam cleaners use solutions with special cleaning agents to eliminate food smells, which could help you get rid of the smell of spoiled milk.  Spoiled milk odors that persist after you've tried home remedies could be so deep in your car's upholstery that you can't reach them with simple methods. Consult an upholstery cleaning expert or a professional car retailer about having the car professionally cleaned and detailed to remove the spoiled milk odors from the car's interior.	Pat dry spilled milk. Remove and wash the floor mats and seat covers. Utilize a wet vacuum. Hire an expert.
There must always be a connection between your message, your style and public expectations. In short, you need to find your own secret formula.; , This is an example of how a 12-song rock album might be organized, but don't feel afraid to branch-out, just don't lose continuity:   Hard Rock Song 1 - Song to Set the Tone of the Album. (But this doesn't have to be in the exact "Hard Rock" style. A good example of "pumping up" the listener, but no using this exact format is AC/DC's "Thunderstruck" from the Razors Edge album.) Power Rock Song 1 - Fast and Catchy. Potential Album Single. (Led Zeppelin's "Rock 'n' Roll" from Led Zeppelin Four is a good example) Moody Rock Song 1 - Slow Down to Allow Last Song to Resonate. Power Rock Song 2 - Lift the Album's Speed Back Up Again. (Led Zeppelin's "Misty Mountain Hop" from Led Zeppelin Four is a good example) Hard Rock Song 2 - Medium Paced Song to Allow the Album to Flow. Dark Song 1 - Something to Catch the Listener Off Guard. Transitional Song - Almost Like a Second Introduction. Hard Rock Song 3 - Real Meat of the Album. Fewer "Hooks." Dark Song 2 - Dark Concept Songs Generally Work Better Later On. Hard Rock Song 4 - Substance With Little Gimmick. Purer Song. Power Song 3 - One Last Heavier Song to Complete the Album. Closing Rock Song - Usually Carries an "Ending" Theme With It.  Most artists will place their 1st album single at the beginning of an album while others will place it anywhere up to the 5th track slot. This list simply outlines the general industry standard called "Front Loading." This is where the album has a decisive flow with it's content perfectly streaming along the first half of the album. Most times the first half of the album holds many key songs in order to make the album sell. The second half of the album is generally there for the artists and true fans of the artist. Hence, the second half of the album is created to be almost a second chapter to the record. , Play gigs wherever you can to get the word out.	Define your trademark and intrigue the public. Choose your songs. Be aware that there are several variations to this formula. Make sure you have a unifying theme.  , Find an agent and/or publicist and begin to market your album.
Attach the yarn to your crochet hook using a slipknot, then work a foundation of 20 chain stitches.   If you do not know how to make slip knots or chain stitches, please see the "Tips" section at the end of this article.  Make three additional chain stitches, then work one double crochet into each stitch of your foundation chain. Chain three at the end of this row, turn, and work one double crochet into each double crochet of your previous row.   If you do not know how to double crochet, please check the "Tips" section for further instructions. This step and the one before it merely creates a foundation for you to work with when creating a cable stitch. These two steps are not actually part of the cable stitch itself. Note that cable stitches can also be worked into foundation rows of single crochet,but it is more commonly seen with rows of double crochet, half double crochet, or treble crochet.  Chain three, then double crochet once into each of the next six stitches.   This step starts the crossed cable row, or the row in which you'll make your crossed cable stitches. Crossed cables, in general, are made by skipping stitches, working a set of front post stitches, and returning to the skipped stitches to make additional front post stitches. In this example, you'll skip three stitches, and work cables across six stitches. The number of skipped stitches and stitches you'll work over may vary based on the specific pattern instructions you're following, however.  Skip over the next three stitches. In the fourth stitch, double crochet once into the front posts only.   Work the front post stitch by inserting the hook through the front of the post, behind it, and back out to the front of the work.  Work one double crochet into the front posts only of the next two stitches, giving you a total of three front post double crochets lying side-by-side.   Note that these stitches should all be slanting to the right.  Return to the first of your three skipped stitches and double crochet once into front posts only. Double crochet once into the front posts only of the second and third skipped stitches, as well.   This step creates a cross cable with stitches that slant to the left.  Work one double crochet into each of the remaining stitches until you reach the end of the row.   This step completes one crossed cable stitch row.  Turn the work and chain three. Skip the first stitch of the previous row, then double crochet once into each of the next six stitches.   You're starting what is known as a "wrong side" row in this step. This row will balance out the cable row and help keep the overall work lying flat.  Work one double crochet into the back posts only of the next six stitches in the row.   Work a back post stitch by inserting the hook through the back of the post, in front of it, and out again to the back of the work.  Work one double crochet into each stitch until you reach the end of the row.   When you reach the end of the row, you've completed one wrong side row.  You already have a full crossed cable at this point, but you should alternate between the crossed cable row and the wrong side row as often as needed until the cable pattern becomes as long as you would like it to be.   Once the pattern reaches your desired length, the process is complete.	Create a foundation chain. Work two rows of double crochet. Double crochet across the beginning of your cable row. Front post double crochet into the next stitch. Repeat twice more. Front post double crochet into your skipped stitches. Double crochet to the end of the row. Double crochet into the start of the next row. Back post double crochet into the next six stitches. Double crochet to the end of the row. Repeat the two rows as needed.
Clean the top edge of the truck bed behind the cab with some rubbing alcohol on a rag. Cut weather strip with scissors to the correct length to reach across the area you just cleaned. It should go from just inside the side rail across to the other side rail.  Drill 1 and 1/4 hole with the hole saw through the plastic factory plugs located near the bottom corners of the truck bed behind the cab. Now push the drain hose through the holes you drilled., Have someone help you place the canister across the truck bed side rails behind the cab. Center the canister with the same distance from each side. It should be approximately 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm)., The side rails kind of lock into the canister ends. Place in and push forward. Now go to the back and lift the side rail slightly and close the tailgate. Hold the side rail down and make sure there is a slight space between the bottom of the side rail and the tailgate so the side rail does not interfere with the tailgate closing. Do the other side rail the same., Measure the cover across. Use this measurement plus approx. 1⁄8 inch (0.3 cm) for clearance. Place shims provided, between the underside of the cover side rail and the pickup truck side rail to achieve this measurement all the way from front to back. Use the clamps and tighten them as you go. Three clamps per side starting from back by the tailgate end., In the center of the canister under the cover there is a small bracket. Pull the cover ahead and lock it there. Remove the nut where the bracket should go, turn the bracket up and replace the nut you removed., Make sure there is at least an inch of hose sticking through the holes you drilled in the plastic plugs. Leave enough hose to reach the drain nipples under the canister on each side and cut the hose off and connect it to the nipples. In addition to the canister there are also drain nipples back near the tailgate in the side rails.  You need to drill holes in the rib of the truck bed side just under the drain nipples in the side rails. Place the rubber grommets provided in the hole and place drain hose on the nipples and out through the grommets.  Place the cover on the canister and thread in the four 10mm bolts and tighten them down. Place the plastic caps provided in the holes to cover the bolts., There is an adjustment to finish off the install that you should watch at the end of the video. You finish the adjustment by drilling a 1⁄8 inch (0.3 cm) hole and using the screws provided to secure it.	Install weather strip behind cab. Install the drain tubes. Install the canister. Install side rails. Shim the side rails. Take care of the center bracket. Add the drain tubes. Finish off the canister. Adjust the cover at the rear.
The frame is the base of the bike, and the most expensive part you can buy. Getting a new frame usually means buying a brand new bike -- unless you have amazing brakes, pedals, gears, and handlebars on your old bike, it is rarely cost effective to buy a new frame and transfer everything over. When shopping for frames, there is a definite hierarchy in frame weight.    Carbon-fiber: The gold standard for light-weight bikes, carbon fiber is unfortunately a bit brittle. You will quite often see it on mountain bikes as the technology has progressed over the years so be careful if you decide to buy a second hand carbon bike. Racing, triathlon, and high-end road bikes are almost exclusively carbon fiber.  Titanium: Stronger as steel but much lighter, titanium is another high-end option often found on mountain and road bikes.  Aluminum: Strong and light, aluminum frames are the most common frames you can buy for any bike.  Steel: Sturdy but heavy, steel is most common on old bikes, which are less concerned with lower weights.; , Perhaps the best "bang for you buck" fix is to get lighter wheels. You will not only lose weight, you'll become remarkably more aerodynamic. Lower spoke-count wheels and wheels made of lighter material will all help lighten your bike. What constitutes an "upgrade" depends on what you currently have, however, generally speaking, you can't go wrong with a few sure-fire light fixes:   Carbon-fiber wheels Tubular wheels, not recommended for anything other than racing as they require special tires that are difficult to install and replace. Aero wheels, Mountain bike tires, which are big and knobby, are going to kill you going up a paved hill. If you find yourself riding more roads than trails, purchase a set of commuter or "cross" tires, which are lighter, offer less friction, and can still accommodate light trails riding. Slicks are also a viable choice for light trails such as footpaths.  Look at your chain rings, which are the big metal gears next to your right pedal. If you have three, you should consider purchasing a "compact crank," which gives you two chain rings. While you'll have less gears to work with, you will loose weight.   If still want to keep the gears but lose the weight, you might compromise with an extra gear in the back, known as your cassette. That said, many riders find that, after 1-2 weeks of riding a compact crank, they forget they ever had a third ring.  Carbon fiber bars or specialty aerodynamic bars, like triathlon bars, will shave off weight and dampen some of the vibrations around your hands on bumpy roads. Remember, however, that carbon fiber is somewhat brittle so if you crash, be sure to get it checked at your local bike shop., There are a lot of additions people put on their bike that, unfortunately, do nothing but add weight. Get rid of any unnecessary saddlebags, lights, fenders, mudflaps, pumps, decorations, and reflectors, especially if you are riding on a dry day outside of a city.If you're going on a short ride, drop any extra water bottle cages, though you should always have at least one water bottle present unless water will be provided by the race. These will only shave a few grams off your total weight -- hardly worth it if you remove a bike light that will protect you on busy roads.  While this is mostly for racers, lighter, shoes and aero helmets cut down weight keep you quick, and look professional. They can get expensive, however. You can also swap out your pedals for racing pedals and wear light-weight shoes that attach to them.  Not for the faint of heart, race trimming involves shaving off every possible gram of weight you can. Professional rider Jack Pullar is perhaps the most extreme example, as he ripped off the seat covering and drilled holes out of his saddle, then sawed off the bottoms of his handlebars, to loose weight. While you should be careful, some race modifications include:   Sawing off your seat post 1-2 inches below where you have it set. Trimming the ends of all your cables and cable housings. Removing water cages and bolts., Unless you're willing to shell out $15,000 for a high-end, pristine 11lb bike, you're not going to be losing that much weight, ever. Switching a lighter group set (your gears) and derailleur, for example, saves the equivalent weight of 1/3 of an iPhone 4.You will not notice the difference. If you're entering the Tour de France, you'll want the absolute lightest bike you can get. Otherwise, stick to a few bigger, cost-effective fixes and work on getting stronger legs, not a lighter bike.   If you've got nice wheels and still want a lighter bike, get a carbon fiber seat or light, small pedals first. They won't make a huge difference, but they will make the bike lighter.	Get the lightest frame you can buy when you get a new bike. Switch out your wheels for easy, immediate weight loss. Make sure you're using the proper tires. Switch to a double crank in your front gears. Pick up aerodynamic handlebars. Remove any unessential hardware. Wear an aerodynamic pair of shoes and helmet. Consider race trimming your bike if you feel comfortable with mechanics. Know that you are usually saving grams, not pounds.
Romance is all about the senses so engage and heighten your sense of taste and smell during this romantic activity.   Name that wine (or beer). Have your partner select a few of your favorite wines (or champagnes or beers) and line up glasses for you to sample. The idea is that you have to describe the smells and flavors exuding from each glass and then guess what type of wine you are drinking. If you want to stay within one family (for example Pinots), take it one step further and try to name the winemaker. Test each other over candlelight to add ambiance. Try different types of romantic food. Choose a line of exclusive, silky chocolates or sample foods that are known to be an aphrodisiac (like oysters or honey). Use a blindfold and feed each other. Then have the blindfolded sampler describe and then name that food. Try to pair similar foods so you don’t end up with a stomach ache (very un-romantic). For example, try a line of sweet foods together or something salty. Identify that scent. Certain scents are known to trigger romance so perform a similar activity as you did with food but use scents instead. Use scented candles or oils as your medium and choose from vanilla, rose, musk, caramel or strawberry amongst others.; , In the days of Shakespeare or Elizabeth Barrett Browning, travel back to the days when a well written, hand scribed letter made lovers swoon.   Send each other romantic poems that you have either written or taken from a famous poet. Exchange letters containing one of your favorite romantic poems or try your hand at writing an original love poem to your sweetheart. Set up a secret mailbox for letter delivery. In the book, “Little Women” the girls exchange secret letters with boy pal Laurie through a hidden mailbox. The secretive mailbox and special location will add a clandestine, intimate element to your activity. In addition to leaving letters, consider adding romantic treats with your letter such as a single rose or a piece of decadent chocolate. Write letters using Shakespearean language for added romance. Travel back in time and try your hand at writing in Shakespearean prose to your betrothed. Show your lover how you pine for him/her and describe your love using references from Shakespeare plays as examples.  Kick your night up a notch with a little romantic scavenger hunt. Leave clues for your honey that will ultimately culminate in an evening together.   Provide clues before your sweetheart arrives home or at your house. Clues could even begin while your betrothed is at work (for example, an email could tell him/her to walk to the car and find the first clue). Provide hint and riddles to lead him/her to you. Include fun, inside jokes or stories as clues (such as referencing your favorite movie as a couple or the place where you had your first date). Set the tone for romance throughout the house. This means that the kids should spend the night at the neighbor’s house (or your mom’s) as you prepare for an intimate evening. Turn on soft music and dim the lights for an ultra romantic effect. Light tea candles to line the walkway as he/she arrives and sprinkle rose petals throughout the house. Leave a special treat when he/she finds each clue. Sweeten the scavenger hunt with a piece of candy, a bottle of wine or a rose along with each clue. You could even make your treat part of the clue or hint for the next destination. Keep the activity short but sweet. Don’t take him/her on a lengthy, wild goose chase, but instead keep it short and sweet. Leave between five to 10 clues.  Get a little sexy and intimate with your activity. From body painting to naughty movie drinking games, add a little spice to your romance.   Have a rude food dinner. Definitely adults only, so send the kids either to bed or to a sleepover. Create phallic-shaped bread or design a banana split he/she won’t soon forget. Examine food shapes to create hilarious, rude shaped food. Some possible tools include bananas, grapes, melons, squash and zucchini. Chocolate body painting. Somewhat traditional, but always fun, try your hand at chocolate body painting. Numerous adult novelty stores offer specialty chocolate body painting or you can make your own mixture at home. Choose your favorite type of chocolate (dark, milk, etc.) and combine with 17.5 ounces of chopped chocolate with 13.5 ounces of cream. Heat using the double boiling method and stir special enhancements if you desire (such as fresh mint, freshly brewed espresso or ground chili pepper). Play a naughty movie drinking game. Grab your favorite bottle of wine or alcohol, along with a good adult film and play the naughty movie drinking game. Choose a random word, name or action in the movie. When that cue becomes apparent take swig of your beverage until the film ends (hopefully you won’t be passed out).	Explore your senses with blindfold taste testing. Romance each other with old fashioned love letter writing. Arrange a romantic scavenger hunt for your lover. Get a little raunchy.
If your toilet has become clogged, don't try to flush it or you'll risk overflowing the toilet. Find the water valve on the wall that connects the waterline to the toilet and turn it clockwise until it stops. Water should stop coming into the tank.   With any tank or flushing issue, you'll want to shut the water off first as a safety precaution. Cleaning up a toilet that's overflown is obviously the biggest of bummers.; , It's called the plumber's helper for a reason. Some plungers have complicated bulb shapes and some are simple suction cups, but you just need to make sure your plunger is big enough to cover the opening at the bottom of the bowl.   Make sure there's enough water in the bowl to cover the cup of the plunger. It's easier to have some water to force the clog out with, but now that you've shut off the water you can't flush anymore in from the tank. Get a few cups of water from the sink to add to the bowl if you need to.  Pump it forcefully and evenly. You should start to hear a gurgling in the pipe and feel some pressure building if you've created a suction with the plunger. After 5-10 pumps with the plunger, break the seal and see if the clog comes loose. If not, try again.   If you can see the clog come up, you can try to flush the water down without turning the water back on. There should be enough water in the bowl to flush it. If the water all flushes down by itself after plunging, turn the water back on and let it run for a few minutes. When the water settles, try flushing it, but watch carefully and make sure it doesn't start to overflow. Shut off the water quickly if it does.  If the clog is close to the top, the plunger should get it. If it has worked its way down the pipe, however, you might need the heavy artillery. A plumber's auger, also called a "snake," is essentially a long wire that you can reel out and guide through the pipe to forcefully dislodge the clog and then reel back up.   Aim the tip of the auger into the bowl drain and reel it out. Be very careful not to force it and crank slowly and evenly. You don't want to bust a pipe fitting or get the auger stuck. When you've run the auger out, or feel that you've broken up the clog, reel it back in and try to plunge the toilet again or flush it and see if the clog has worked it's way through. If you don't want to buy an auger, you can fashion a simple device with a wire hanger to try to get at the clog.	Shut the water off. Get a plunger. Fix the suction cup onto the opening at the bottom of the bowl. Use a plumber's auger or a "snake."
This is the quickest way to find out if Formula 1 is right for you. It is ideal for older racers that are new to the sport. You will get to get behind the wheel of a Formula 1 race car and learn some of the basics of racing.These classes may have a substantial fee for a few hours of racing knowledge, but it is the most affordable way to gain knowledge about Formula 1 racing before you decide to make a larger financial commitment.   You must have a valid standard driver's license to take these classes, and if you are a minor you will also need parental consent. You must be capable of driving a car with a manual transmission to take racing classes.; , These programs will involve approximately 1-2 weeks of advanced classes to hone your racing skills. Since your goal is to race in Formula One, you likely want to select a school that is approved by the licensing organization.  Upon completion of the required courses your school will send a letter of recommendation to a racing organization. This will enable you to register and compete in a racing school event.  These entry level race events are a great opportunity for amateur drivers to showcase their skills and get the attention of potential sponsors. Some schools hold their own races and will even provide you a car for these race events. You can win scholarships and race points towards getting your next level license.	Take a class at a racing school. Enroll in a racing program. Get your racing license. Enter an amateur school race series.
If your hair is any color other than jet black, you’ll have to dye it. You can go to your local hair stylist and have them dye your hair or you can buy dye from a local store and do it yourself at home.   If you need to look like Shino for a long period of time, you can use permanent dye that will last until your hair grows out. If you only need to look like Shino for a few days, temporary henna hair dye will do the trick. If you really don’t want to dye your hair, you can use a wig, but it may not look as natural.; , Wash and dry your hair and comb out any tangles. Squeeze a quarter size amount of hair glue in your palm, rub it between your hands and work it into your hair. Starting at the base, use your thumb and forefinger to create spikes that stand straight up. Repeat the process with the rest of your hair.When you’ve finished spiking your hair, Spray a copious amount of hair spray all around it to ensure your spikes stay up.   If your air is curly or wavy, you may need to use a hair straightener before creating spikes. Use hair glue designed to hold hair straight up. If you use hair gel, your spikes may fall.  Draw the leaf village symbol on a piece of metallic paper with a sharpie. Cut the metallic paper into a rectangle with an x-acto knife and smooth out the edges. Cut a long thick strand of black fabric for your band. Fold the fabric and sew the edges together. Leave one end of the fabric unsewn and pull the band inside out through it. Sew the remaining end of the fabric together and superglue the metallic paper to the center of your headband. After the super glue dries, wrap the headband around your head. Make a mark on the back of your headband where both sides of it meet. Cut off the excess cloth at your mark and sew both sides together so that your headband fits snug.After your fabric is folded, it should be the same width as your piece of metallic paper. .  It should have a long collar that covers half your face. Shino wears a jacket that is too large so that others don’t see his bugs burrowing into his skin.  Shino never shows his eyes. His sunglasses help him to hide his emotions and intentions from his opponents.   If you can, find glasses with circular lenses like Shino’s.  Cut them around eight inches shorter than your leg. Get some white tape and wrap it around your right thigh. Then get some black tape and wrap it around the same thigh on top of the white tape.   There should be thin strip of black tape in the middle of the white tape. Brown sweatpants may work best. Shino battles often and needs pants that allow him to be as mobile as possible.  You can order these from a cosplay site like cosplayfu.com or you can make your own. Use scissors to cut the tops off of an old pair of sneakers leaving only the soles and the back of the shoes. Put on a pair of blue knee-high socks and make a mark on them at the top of your index toe. Take of the socks. Cut them at your mark and pull them over the shoes. Slide your feet into your newly designed shoes. Your toes should be exposed., Shino is a master strategist. He often uses false attacks to plant bugs on his opponents that slowly drain their chakra. (life energy) Educate yourself in combat strategy the way Shino does to gain the edge on his opponents.   Smoke out your enemies and inwardly declare war so that you can strike without warning. Focus your mind on the present moment. Learn to detach yourself from chaos to make rational decisions. Learn to read your opponent. Pay attention to your enemy’s behavior., Shino’s favorite hobby is insect watching. Observe the actions of various bugs and study them as much as you can. You may not be able to command hordes of bugs the way Shino does but you can train insects to go where you want them to if you know what motivates them.Ants follow lines of sugar. Spiders tend to flee away from the heavy streams of air from a hair dryer.  Shino keeps his emotions hidden, making it difficult for his enemies to read his intentions. Practice hiding your emotions. Be sure to watch out for body language that could betray the way you feel.Uncross your arms and don't clench your neck when you're feel defensive. Relax your stare and loosen your fists when you feel anger.  When Naruto returns to the village after three year, he doesn’t recognize Shino. Shino holds a grudge against him for the rest of the series. Don’t let anything go, at least while you’re Shino Aburame., If people ask you questions, respond with short answers. For example, if someone asks you what you do for a living, respond with a simple “I’m a businessman,” or whatever it is that you do. Don’t give any further details.Don’t feel any need to explain yourself. Let people wonder about you.  When Shino does talk, he says exactly what he means. Don’t sugarcoat the truth. For example, if someone asks you if you like their cosplay outfit, say either “yes I do,” or “no I don’t.” .   Make sure people know you’re speaking in character so they don’t think you’re a jerk.  When daily nuisances arise, don’t get worked up. Instead, focus on ways to solve them.   If you stub your toe on a couch while your getting ready, don’t get mad and kick the couch. Rather, rearrange the furniture so the room is less cluttered reducing the chance of you stubbing your toe again. If you have a flat tire on the way to a cosplay convention, don’t waste time cursing and being upset. Calmly, replace the tire with your spare and carefully drive to the nearest automotive shop.  Shino Aburame takes control of situations. Be firm with people and don’t let them take advantage of you.   When someone cuts in front of you in line at a cosplay event, calmly demand that they move to the back of the line. If you go out to eat with your friends after the event and a waiter brings you the wrong food, calmly alert the waiter to mix-up and ask for the food you ordered.	Dye your hair. Spike your hair. Make a leaf village headband. Wear a light gray jacket that is much too large for you. Wear black frame sunglasses. Wear brown pants that that are loose fitting. Wear blue sandals with blue coverings over the top. Learn combat strategy. Be fascinated by insects. Never show your emotions. Hold grudges. Be very mysterious. Be blunt. Make decisions based on your judgement rather than your emotions.Shino is always able to calm his emotions so he can accurately read his opponent. Be assertive.
This galaxy jar is simple and easy to make. Because you will be painting it with glow-in-the-dark paint, you can use it again and again. Here's a list of what you will need:Mason jar Glow-in-the-dark paint Paint brush Paint pallet or paper plate Rubbing alcohol; , It would be a good idea to do this, even if the jar looks clean. Any dust or dirt that's on the jar will prevent the paint from sticking. Be sure to scrub off any labels and glue residue.  Soak a cotton ball with some rubbing alcohol and wipe down the jar. Be sure to get both the inside and the outside. This will get rid of any residue and oils that the soap missed.  You can use any color of glow-in-the-dark paint, but colors such as yellow and orange might look more like stars than purple and green. Glow-in-the-dark paint usually comes in two different forms: liquid paint and puff paint. Liquid glow-in-the-dark paint is just like any acrylic paint and needs to be put in with a paintbrush. Puff paint comes in a bottle with a pointy tip. You can draw with it straight from the bottle.   You can find puff paint in the t-shirt and fabric paint section of an arts and crafts store. It may also be labeled as "3D paint" or "dimensional paint." It has a slightly raised surface when it dries.  It will be easier to dip your paintbrush into a little puddle of paint than into a bottle of paint. Do not pour out too much paint at one time. Most acrylic paints dry quickly. If you pour out too much paint, it may dry up before you finish using it.   If you are using puff paint, you don't need to do this, because you can apply the paint straight from the bottle.  You can paint inside the jar or outside the jar. Painting on the outside will be easier, but the paint will be more likely to get scratched off. Painting on the inside will be harder, but the paint will last longer.   If you are using puff paint, simply take the cap off, and start making little dots all over the jar.  This will make your jar resemble the night sky even more. Look up some of your favorite constellations, and try to copy the pattern onto the jar. Orion, the Big Dipper, and the Little Dipper are popular ones.  Most paints should dry within two hours, but some paints (such as puff paints) may take longer. Read the label for more specific drying times. Once the paint is dry, you can put the lid back on. This is not necessary, since there is nothing inside the jar that can fall out.   The sunlight will also activate the glowing particles in the paint.  If the jar does not glow, you might need to leave it under a bright light for a little longer. Most glow-in-the-dark paints need to sit under a bright light for at least two hours.	Gather your supplies. Clean the jar with soap and water. Wipe the jar down with rubbing alcohol. Choose your paint. Pour a coin-sized drop of paint onto a pallet or paper plate. Dip the paintbrush into the paint, and make small dots on the jar. Consider painting some stars, planets, or constellations. Leave the jar in the sun so that the paint can dry. Take the jar into a dark room and watch it glow.
It's important that everything about your new cello look, feel, and especially sound appealing to you. If you only test one and assume that it's the perfect fit, you might miss something better. As you go along, do not pay attention to or ask about the price or brand of the instruments (yet!). Instead, ask your accompanying expert what they think of the sound, and try to pick a few that you'd like to physically test later after giving them all a thorough inspection.Have your teacher or selected expert inspect the cellos as well.  Although it might be tempting to treat buying a cello the way you might buy clothes (finding the perfect brand name and sticking with it) this is probably not the best way to go about it. Although there are perhaps some brands that should be avoided, most that you'll find in a store should be generally reliable. Talk with experts you trust, and ask other cellists (who you may know through orchestra or lessons) about which brands they might recommend, but try to experiment with a range of cellos across different brands.  The size of the cello that you will need is based primarily on height: cellists who are 5 feet or taller should generally be able to use a full-size cello, and those from 4 - 4½ feet tall should seek a half sized cello. Those who are in the middle between those two sizes will probably be more comfortable with the smaller cello.Due to the cost of a cello, you may wish to take into account whether or not there is a high likelihood you will continue to grow; most girls reach physical maturity around 15 years old, and boys around 16 or 17, and until then you may continue to grow.To determine if a cello is the correct size for you, sit in a chair from which you can comfortably rest your feet on the floor. Make sure your back is straight. Pull the endpin out a foot in length and allow the instrument to rest at a 45 degree angle against your chest. The top of it should come to the middle of your chest, with the peg for the C string situated near your left ear., Most shops will have a quiet area for you to test a cello out in, but some will also allow you to take it out of the store to test in other areas. If they do allow the latter, take advantage of this and test the cello in spaces you will commonly play--your home, wherever you take lessons or practice, the orchestra or band hall--to conduct additional tests.   You should be on the lookout for good tone and playability that is consistent whether the instrument is directly underneath your ear or all the way across a very large room. Unfortunately, there is no science to this step; you will have to make the choice based on your own instinct and your mentor's advice.One sign of a quality cello is the presence of the occasional wolf note, wherein the vibrations between the instrument and the string itself cancel each other out so quickly and repeatedly that the note stutters as it's made.	Choose a variety of instruments for inspection. Don't select cellos solely by brand. Be sure it's the correct size. Test it out.
Go through the music and choose stuff that you have never heard before, but you are still comfortable with listening to.; , Set the music selection genre to random, or choose one genre and let the music play on its own. If the song that gets played randomly makes you feel nothing then skip it and go to the next. But if the song captured your attention then in another tab explore the artist's discography to find some other works you might like. Don't be bias towards any particular genre and explore everything. Maybe even classical music. YouTube is a great idea if you already know the genres you're looking for.  Most colleges have a radio station run by the students. Since the student DJs can pick their own music, these stations usually are a good place to hear new non-commercial stations. Internet radio stations are also often a good source of new music.  Many other sites have this feature.  Choose an artist you like, and click on the "Related Artist" tab and click a random link. Do this a couple times and you just may find one of your new favorite bands.  A lot of the bands are pretty decent, but hide the song titles from your friends!  , If, for example, you find a nice symphonic metal group with a female singer, you'll probably find lots more under the "female metal singers" tag.  You will be able to hear songs similar to what you have chosen.  Music is meant to enhance the quality of your life. Chasing "acceptable" music may deter you from enjoying varied artists that have a lot to offer than the commercially produced music. It is important that the music you choose to listen to everyday makes you happy because it is the soundtrack to the story of your life. Imagine if your life were a movie being played out then what kind of songs would you put in there? Would you keep songs you don't particularly like just because they are acceptable to other people? Or would you want to keep music that inspires you, makes you feel myriad of emotions and reflects what is going on in your own personal life? Be able to be comfortable with your taste in music.	Contact a friend that you know who listens to unique music, and tell him/her to send you his/her favorite music. Go to random music sites and listen to different types of music. Listen to non-conformist radio stations and get ideas from them. When you do find an artist you like, search for their CD at Amazon and check out the "People who bought this also bought..." part. Samgoody.com is another way to find different artists to listen to. Search for Wizard Rock on Google. If you find an unusual artist, look it up on Last.fm and see what shows up under their tags. Go to Pandora once you find a musician or song you're interested in, and create a "station" with that song or musician. Have confidence in your taste.
Some guitars are around $1000, or if you're in the market for a Les Paul, $3500. Basically get the best guitar you can afford to get at the time. It makes a difference.; , They might have to put it under their name if you are under 18.  Only withdraw the money when you're going to buy the guitar.  It is very important that you decide the exact make and model and that you stick to it.  Don't only go to the extremely large ones, but try to find some small, privately owned ones also. Check there for your guitar and start writing down the store name, price, whether it is new or used, and what condition it is in. This should start to get you a good idea of how much it will cost.  Don't get anxious and buy the first guitar you see. You need to wait it out. After 2 or 3 months, you will find an amazing deal., They will help you decide if it is in good enough condition, and will keep you from buying it on impulse. Don't be afraid to do this more than once. If the guitar is not right for you, keep waiting.  Guitar stores always mark up prices, and with a little pressure, you can make them bring it down, especially if it is used.  Good things to say:  "Well, I don't really have quite enough right now..." "I think I saw it cheaper at (insert store)." "Um... I think I'm going to shop around a little more... maybe find a better deal." "If you take 100 bucks off the price, I'll take it off your hands right now."    ,	Find some income. Open up a savings account at your or your parents' bank. Put as much money as you can in there, and make sure when it goes in, it doesn't come out. Decide ahead of time which guitar you want. Every weekend, call, go online to, or go to some local guitar stores. Be patient. When it comes time to buy the guitar, take a friend that plays guitar with you to get it. Once you decide on buying it, make sure you haggle. Now you have that guitar you've always dreamed of, and you don't have to go broke.
You want the stems to be at least 3 inches (7.62 centimeters) long. You can use just one type of flower, or a variety.   Daisies and dandelions are classical, but you can also use alyssum or forget-me-nots. Flowering herbs, such as mint, thyme, oregano, chamomile, and lavender work as well. They will also smell great.  This will make the flowers easier to braid and take off any unnecessary bulk.  This will keep the flowers fresh while you work. Braided flower crowns can take a while to make, and the picked flowers may wilt by the time you get around to using them.  Wrap a small piece of wire around the stems a few times, and snip the excess off. Try to get wire as close to the blooms as possible. You want all the blooms to be at the same level; if one sits higher than the other, your crown will look uneven. The wire will hold the flowers together while you braid them.   If you don't have any floral wire, use twist ties or thread instead.  Take the left stem and pull it over so it ends up between the middle and right stems. Take the right stem and bring over so that it ends up between the left and middle stems. Keep doing this until your braid is 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) long., The new flower should sit just beneath the one that is already in the braid.  Keep them together; they will count as one stem.  The new flower should sit just below the flower that is already in the braid.  Don't let the stems spread apart. Try to keep them together and think of them as one thick stem.  The sections you are braiding will get thicker and thicker as you continue to add flowers.   Try using different types of flowers. This will add color, texture, and beauty. Don't be afraid to weave in a few leaves, vines, or grasses.  You want the garland to be a little large, because you will be overlapping the two ends. This will make the crown more secure in the end.  Place the wire just beneath the blooms of the last bunch of flowers. Wrap the wire around the end of the garland a few times, then snip the excess off with a pair of wire cutters. This will hold your flowers together and keep the garland from unraveling.  Overlap the ends until the crown sits comfortably on your head. Hold the two ends together as you take the crown off.  When you come across a flower, thread the wire underneath the bloom. You are binding just the stems together. Once the crown is secure, snip the excess wire off. Gently tuck both ends of the wire into the braided stems.	Choose flowers with thin, flexible stems. Cut the stems so that they are all the same length and trim off any leaves. Put the flowers into a bowl filled with cool water. Hold three flowers and loosely tie them together using piece of floral wire. Start braiding the stems together. Add a flower to the left stem. Bring both stems over so that they end up between the right and middle stems. Add a flower to the right stem. Bring both stems over so that they end up between the left and middle stems. Keep repeating the last few steps until you get the length you want. Stop when the garland is just a few inches too big. Wrap some wire around the end of the garland. Bring both ends of the garland together. Wrap wire around both ends to hold them together.
Being called by the muse is a wonderful thing, without a doubt, but without the technical abilities to realize your vision, you won't get very far. Whatever your chosen medium or media, become an expert in every part of it.   Set aside an hour or more each day to devote to nothing but practicing your technique. Focus especially on those areas that are the weakest for you, but build your strengths as well. Take advantage of the communities and resources that you can find. Artist supply manufacturers, and art stores themselves, often have free literature, tutorials, videos, and websites that are loaded with tips, techniques, and more. Some stores even offer weekend training seminars, where you can not only pick up some new skills, you'll also meet other artists.; , Choose one subject that is meaningful to you and that you want to be able to draw well.   Start with a still life, or a photo that's yours, in public domain, or that you have permission to use. Draw or paint that same photo over and over, using different approaches—paint, pencil, abstract, realism—whatever moves you. Build up from easy subjects, like a rubber ball or a rectangular block, to more complicated, difficult subject, like a rose, a clear glass marble or a shiny metal bowl. And try to get the details right: the curves of a petal, the clarity of the glass, or reflections so good that Escher would be impressed! Each of them will improve your ability to draw in general. Practice timed gesture drawing. Pick your subject, set your timer for two or three minutes, start drawing, then stop when the timer goes off, even if the drawing isn't finished. Set the timer again and start over. Doing 10 three minute drawings will give you more skill than taking half an hour to draw the same thing in detail.  Start off with a pencil, then go to charcoal, colored pencils, pastels, paint, whatever interests you. Never fear trying new tools or techniques.   When trying an expensive new medium, visit Dick Blick or Jerry's Artarama and email them for samples. Many types of art suppliers make sample sized products or the company will send out just one stick or a small piece of the expensive paper or canvas for you to test before deciding what to buy. This gives you a chance to try it first and see if you like it. Try more than one brand—the samples are usually not the same color and you can find out which brand to invest in by those trials.  Make it clear you want a real opinion, not just a biased, "I love you so everything you do is wonderful" opinion. If they think it's good, then you're on the right track! If they don't, you're still on the right track: if several people think your technique is great, but your subject matter leaves something to be desired, that's an opportunity for self-reflection and to learn something.   Don't confuse critique with personal criticism, especially if the critic is somebody who is not interested in seeing you become an artist.  Look for critique from people who draw better than you do. Make friends online with real artists whose work you admire. Compliment them and ask intelligent questions about their techniques. You'll rapidly find that many artists enjoy teaching beginners and will be happy to share what they've learned.   As you learn more, reach out to those who are just starting. You will learn more every time you explain and demonstrate what you already know. It's very common for teachers to learn from their students!  , When friends and family members love everything you draw and think it's wonderful, or your mum was putting your childhood scribblings up on the fridge from the time you were two (and believes you'll be Picasso someday), relax and enjoy that as support.   The better you get at art, the easier it is for people to compliment you and call you talented. Compliments can sometimes be critiques, and those are very valuable! Should an artist whose work you admire give you a compliment such as, "I love the colors in this," this means they are not only nice enough to compliment you on your work, but have taken the time to understand and appreciate the choices you made.  Do this by learning to paint and draw your favorite subjects in all the ways that every painter you like best has done them. The more you learn technique and understand your own passions, the more your own style will emerge.   Having a personal style is a combination of learning to draw and paint well in your favorite mediums while consistently paying the most attention to your favorite subjects. You will become a specialist, a "brand of one" at a certain intermediate level of competence. Mastering a subject and a medium comes later, at the point when you could do it easily without thinking at all about how you do it, yet always have consistent results.  To get into a gallery, you should have a portfolio of up to a dozen of your best works, all of which have something in common, be it the subject or style, general size and level of skill.   Make your work available in as many formats as possible, so that there are no barriers for interested gallery owners or art patrons to view your work.  The best way to become famous is to get known! The internet offers many avenues to be seen and promote artistic works, and in the information-loaded 21st century, it's important to use all the tools at your disposal to build your name and your reputation.   Blog daily about your work, and include illustrations showing your process and a gallery to show (and/or sell) your finished works. Visit all the galleries in your area, and get to know the proprietors. If you're old enough, attend as many openings as possible, not to promote your own work—there will be time enough for that later—but to become a known artist in the community. Create a Facebook for your art, and encourage people to visit and like your page. Reach out to other artists through Facebook. Like visiting galleries, this will help place you in the community, and Facebook can reach well beyond your neighborhood. Tweet about art regularly. Your art, historical art, pop art, any art at all. The more you know about art, the more you'll be recognized as somebody worth paying attention to. At the same time, follow artists and galleries, and respond to their tweets. This will encourage more people—including gallery owners—to follow you. Create a Flickr account and post scans or photos of your art. It's an active community, and while you won't get a lot of helpful critique on Flickr, you will build your name recognition, and perhaps become online friends with some very talented artists.  Start with student level contests at first and small local art contests.   Teach workshops. This will help you not only get known as an artist, but also as an expert in your field. Build your skills until you can enter major national and international contests in your chosen medium. Enter juried art shows. Getting a painting into a juried art show is itself an achievement to put on your resume. When you have too many, shorten it by listing only the most important shows.  Read up on art agencies and contact the agent's other clients. See if they are happy with the agent, or are generally discontented or feel as if they've been ripped off. Agents will market you and your work, and also represent you in contract negotiation. Make sure they are well-connected and good with contracts.   You might also want to work with a reputable attorney who specializes in the art world. While an agent may know a bit about the law, their job is promotion. A lawyer's only job is knowing about the applicable law.  If you don't care about the subject, it will show in your work. Many artists fall a little bit in love with their subject, whether it be a bowl of fruit or the artist's model.   If you like expressing anger and dark emotions, study dark painters. If you like abstracts and splatter paintings, study them and do them—they take their own techniques and don't just happen because someone threw paint at a canvas and called it art. If you love wildlife and the outdoors, get a small portable painting kit and paint "en plein air" (outdoors) in your favorite places. Whatever your passion, find ways to capture that passion on the canvas.  Being a true artist is a lifelong pursuit. When you've reached the level of fame to which you aspire, with plenty of money and acclaim, you will still want to look forward to something beyond that.   Continuing to learn and invent, even after you are famous will not just keep you on top of your game, focused on the future instead of putting your best years behind you. As you style grows and changes, older paintings you've done become more valuable. Collectors will be interested in the entire history of your life's work. Even the drawings you did as a child become valuable: what your mom stuck to the fridge has the seeds of your current success, so don't throw away earlier works.	Practice. Work on the things you love. Vary the art tools you use. Get critiqued by family and friends. Look outside your circle for opinions. Learn to accept compliments gracefully. Develop a strong personal style. Be prolific. Publish your work. Join fine art societies and enter contests. Find a reliable art agent. Paint what you care about. Keep growing as an artist.
This is a great way to dry leaves for crafts, but some color fading will occur. Place fresh leaves on top of two paper towels. Cover them with another single layer of paper towel.   Use freshly fallen leaves that are still vibrant and pliable. Avoid leaves that are curling at the ends or those that have rips or rotted spots. For best results, leave a little space in between each leaf to prevent them from sticking together as they dry.  Place the leaves in the microwave and heat them for 30 seconds. Afterward, continue microwaving the leaves in 5-second intervals.Autumn leaves will generally need to be microwaved 30 to 180 seconds before they are sufficiently dry. Be very attentive when microwaving leaves. If cooked too long, leaves can actually catch fire. Leaves that appear scorched have been microwaved too long. Leaves that curl at the ends after being removed from the microwave have not been microwaved long enough.  Store the leaves in a draft-free, shady area. Leave them there overnight, at minimum, or for two days, at maximum. If you notice a change in color, the leaves should be sealed immediately.  Spray both sides of each leaf with clear acrylic craft spray to preserve the remaining color. Let the leaves dry before using them as decorations or for crafts.	Sandwich fresh leaves between paper towels. Microwave the leaves to dry them out. Let the leaves sit out overnight. Seal the leaves with craft spray.
Lift the new toilet and place it so that the anchor bolts go through the holes in the base of the toilet. It will be easier if you remove the new tank first and only put in the base, if the toilet came pre-assembled.  Rock the bowl back and forth a little and press it firmly downwards, either by pressing with your arms and hands or by sitting on the toilet. This will help seal the new wax ring.  At the base of the toilet, put in the new washers and nuts. Do not immediately put them on tight though! Place a level across the seat of the toilet and use wood shims underneath the base to make sure the toilet is level. Then, tighten the nuts on each side, alternating between the two sides, tightening just a little at a time to make sure the toilet is kept level. Do not tighten the nuts too much: you don’t want to crack your new toilet!   Make sure you’re being careful at this point not to move the toilet too much, as this will cause the seal on the toilet to break.  Place the new caps on the anchor bolts. If they are too high, you can trim them down with a hacksaw.  Next, take the new tank and place it on its side. Insert the tank bolts and washers from the inside of the tank and then put the tank-to-bowl gasket around the hole at the base.  Take the tank and place it on the main part of the toilet, so that the bolts fit through the appropriate holes. Then add washers and nuts and tighten them, alternating sides as you did with the toilet base. Make sure not to make it too tight.	Place the toilet. Seal the wax ring. Replace the nuts and washers. Place the bolt caps. Insert tank bolts and gasket. Place and secure the tank.
Staying busy with activities that are meaningful to you, however, can be energizing. Focus on devoting more time to doing the things that really matter to you. Get inspired and busy yourself with activities that will move you closer to some of your life goals.   Make a list of your life goals. Include the loftier ones that feel more like dreams than goals, too! The list is your road map. Plot out what steps need to be taken to reach each goal and then get started.; , You probably have at least one hobby in your life that you really enjoy, if not more. Concentrate on one or two of them. Become an expert! If your hobby is an artistic or creative pursuit, put some time and energy into becoming more skillful at it. Even hobbies that don’t seem action-oriented on the surface can be explored deeply.   For example, if your hobby is reading, you can start in on that stack of novels you’ve been meaning to read. But don’t stop there. Research new authors and explore new genres. Start a blog and write reviews of the books you read. Join a book club.No matter what your hobby is, there is always a way to take it to the next level.  Or you could get busy with a project at home, like replacing all of the curtains, building a piece of furniture, or painting the walls a new color.   If you are coordinating an event soon, you can focus on that as a project. For example, you could finally rebuild that classic car you’ve had stored in the garage for months.  For instance, maybe you want to improve your writing or Photoshop skills. If you enjoy cooking, try taking a cooking class. Love yoga? Sign up for a program at your local gym. Technical school classes and on-the-job training are great ways to develop and increase your skills, as well.   Taking a formal class isn’t the only way to approach this. Be your own instructor and educate yourself! For example, perhaps you have some specialized knowledge on a topic that you can develop further by doing internet research, checking out local libraries, visiting museums, etc.	Do what you love.Keeping busy with menial tasks and other day to day activities can become exhausting. Pursue a hobby. Focus on a project.If you’re in the middle of a work or school project that you’re enjoying, really throw yourself into honing your skills and making it a success. Take a class.Sharpen some of your current skills by signing up for an online college course on the topic.
While this treatment can be effective throughout different seasons, it is usually easiest to apply it during the late fall, after most foliage has died off.   Do not use the cut-and-paint method during early spring. Privet sap flows upward at that time of year, so the exposed stump will quickly become damp and sticky after you cut it, thereby reducing the effectiveness of the herbicide.  Herbicides made with glyphosate or triclopyr amine are best. Mix either herbicide with water to form an appropriate solution.   When using glyphosate, choose a concentrate with 41 percent or higher. When using triclopyr amine, choose a concentrate with 44 percent or higher. For either glyphosate or triclopyr amine, combine 32 fluid ounces (945 ml) with enough water to make 1 gallon (4 L) of prepared solution. If you'll need to postpone chemical treatment after performing the cutting, you should use 26 fluid ounces (770 ml) of a triclopyr ester herbicide mixed with enough diesel or bark oil to create 1 gallon (4 L) of solution.  Cut down the privet stem, leaving only a short stump. Remove any sawdust from the site before continuing.   Any cut you make should lie beneath the lowest branch of the stem. Cuts lying at ground level are best, but the process should still work as long as the stump is low and there are no branches left on the remains. If the privet is larger than 6 inches (15 cm) in diameter, you may need to drill holes into the stump to improve the effectiveness of the herbicide. Use a 10 mm drill bit to create downward holes in the cut surface, spacing them 4 inches (10 cm) apart.  For the best results, you should immediately paint or spray the cut area with your prepared herbicide solution.   One of the easiest ways to apply the solution is with a spray bottle. Cover the entire cut area until it becomes moist, but do not allow the herbicide to drip off and form a puddle around the stump. Herbicide application should usually be performed within minutes of the cutting procedure. If you cannot do so, apply an appropriate triclopyr ester solution within two or three weeks of cutting.  If done correctly, every treated privet stem should die off, making a second application unnecessary in most cases.   If the privet does not die off within one or two months, however, you can attempt to reapply the herbicide solution following the same procedure.	Apply this treatment during the fall. Mix an appropriate herbicide solution. Cut down the privet. Paint the privet with the herbicide solution. Reapply only if necessary.
Making a garden trellis is not difficult, but it does require some special tools and materials. To build a garden trellis, you will need:         miter saw or circular saw drill sander eye and ear protection eight boards measuring 1 ½ inches x 1 ½ inches by 8 feet lots of 2 ½ inch exterior grade screws tape measure pencil; , Take your 8 foot long boards and measure them to the dimensions that you need for this project. Use your pencil to mark the boards where they will need to be cut. You will need to measure and mark your 8 foot boards so that you will end up with:         four 72 inch boards seven 48 inch boards several small pieces (about 6 inches) to use as spacers (optional)  , After you have finished measuring and marking all of your boards, you can use your miter saw or circular saw to cut them. Use the pencil marks that you made on the boards to cut the boards to the required dimensions.         Make sure that you wear your ear and eye protection when you use the saw. Watch your fingers and be very careful when cutting your wood pieces. If you are worried about cutting the wood or if you do not have a saw, then you can also consider getting them cut at the hardware store.  Do your best to smooth out any rough edges on the ends of the boards.You can use a power sander or a manual sander to smooth out the ends and edges of your boards.          Start with a coarse grit sandpaper such as #80 grit and then advance to a finer grit sandpaper as you remove the larger flaws in the wood. For example, you might finish sanding the trellis edges with a #150 or #180 grit sandpaper.Don’t forget to wear your ear and eye protection if you are using a power sander.  Lay out two of your 72 inch pieces so that they are parallel with each other. Then, place two of your 48 inch pieces on top of them so that they resemble a picture frame. Next, screw the corners of the 48 inch boards the corners of the 72 inch boards.         Place two screws into each of the four corners to keep the trellis from pivoting. You can make pilot holes before you place your screws to help prevent the screws from splitting the wood, but this is optional. If you decide to make pilot holes, then they should be as big as the smallest diameter of your screws.Use a smaller sized drill bit that is as long as your screw to create the pilot hole before you place the screws.  After you have created the frame, you should have two 72 inch pieces left. Measure along each of your 48 inch frame pieces to determine where to connect your last two 72 inch pieces. These two pieces should be evenly spaced between the other two 72 inch pieces.         Secure the ends of the 72 inch pieces to the 48 inch pieces with a couple of screws.  Measure the two outer 72 inch boards and place pencil marks to indicate where you want to place your five remaining 48 inch boards. You can place them wherever you want, but make sure that these marks are even with each other so that the boards will be straight.         To get a sense of how to space your boards, you can start by placing one board so that it lays across the centers of the 72 inch boards. Then place the other four pieces in the spaces that are left. Consider how you plan to use the trellis before deciding where to place the boards. For example, you might like to have a couple of boards lower to the ground to hang a planter. After you have decided where each of the boards should be placed, secure them with screws.  If you want to leave a gap between the back of your trellis and the wall, then you can add some spacers to the back of your trellis. You can also add spacers to the front if you plan to hang something from the front (such as a planter or trough) that may sag without a spacer.         If adding spacers to the back of your trellis, secure them to each of the four corners as well as a few in the center. If adding spacers to the front of your trellis, then place them wherever you think you may need them. Use your drill and a screw or two to secure your spacers.  Use your drill and screws to secure your trellis to a wall or sturdy fence. Place screws at each of the four corners of the trellis as well as a couple of screws in the center to secure your trellis in place.         Make sure that the screws that you use are long enough to go all the way through the trellis and into the wall behind it. For example, if you have placed spacers at your corners, then you will need screw that are at least five inches long to secure the trellis to the wall.	Gather your tools and supplies. Measure and mark your boards. Cut your boards. Sand the ends and edges of the boards. Create the frame. Connect your last two 72 inch boards to your 48 inch boards. Secure your other five 48 inch boards to the frame. Add spacers if desired. Hang your trellis.
Metaldehyde is a natural compound which is used as a pesticide for killing snails, slugs and other gastropods. It is highly effective, however it is also toxic, so it should not be used in home gardens where pets such as cats or dogs are allowed to roam freely, or where it runs the risk of being consumed by small children., Iron phosphate is a molluscicide used for killing slugs and snails. It is the main ingredient in commercial slug repellents (such as Sluggo Plus) and as it is only harmful to slugs and snails, it is a much better option for people with children and pets., Crush garlic and mix with water. Leave for a few hours to allow the garlic to "marinate". Add to a water spray can and spray your flowers, plants and herbs for a natural slug and snail repellent.	Use metaldehyde. Use iron phosphate. Make garlic spray.

; , Try a local web-based service first. Advertising there is sometimes free and will let those in your local area know about what you are offering. , They will send someone to pick up your car and give you a receipt for a donation. You may be able to use this as a tax deduction. They will probably not use your car, but rather, will have an agreement with someone who will sell it at auction.  Old models are especially good for this. Car buffs are always searching online auction pages in order to find compatible parts (e.g., headlights, turn signals or bumpers) for their model of car.   Call around to local mechanics and junkyards to see if your car has value for parts or as scrap.	Decide whether to sell your car, give it away, or chop it up. Consider not wasting too much money on advertising. Think about donating your car to a family member or someone who needs it.  , Consider donating to a local charity which accepts car donations. Sell pieces of your car if none of the above will work for you.
To bedazzle your sneakers with crystals or rhinestones you will need:          A packet of flatback crystals or rhinestones. How many you need will depend on how much of the surface of the shoes you intend to cover. A tube of e6000 adhesive. This is a very strong craft adhesive which will prevent your rhinestones or crystals from coming loose. It should only be used in a well-ventilated room. A jewel setter. This is a small plastic stick which has a ball of wax on one end. It is used to easily pick up and set small jewels during craft projects. If you you don't have a jewel setter, you can use a pair of tweezers. You will also need a piece of sandpaper (or an emery board), some rubbing alcohol, a clean cloth and a pair of sneakers.  Although you can apply crystals or rhinestones to any part of the sneaker you like, only applying them to the rubber toe of Converse-like tennis shoes creates a very cool, designer-style effect. However, in order to do this, you will first need to prepare the rubber:          Take the piece of sandpaper or emery board and rub the toe of your sneaker for a minute or two. This roughs up the surface of the rubber, creating a better surface for the adhesive to bond to. Take the clean cloth and dip it in the rubbing alcohol. Rub the cloth over the sanded rubber toe to remove any rubber residue or dust. The alcohol will dry very quickly, so you can proceed with your crafting immediately!  , Take the tube of e6000 and apply a thin line of adhesive around the toe of the sneakers, in a semi-circle from one edge of the fabric to the other. You should only work with a single line of adhesive at a time, as it dries very quickly.          Open the pack of crystals and lay them out on the table beside you, shiny side up. Take the jewel setter and press it gently into a single crystal to pick it up (don't press too hard or it will become embedded in the wax). Press the crystal gently onto the prepared line of glue. Use the opposite (pointed) end of the jewel setter to press the crystal firmly onto the shoe. Continue adding more crystals along the line of glue, using the same technique.  Add a second semicircle of glue just inside the first row of crystals, then add a second row. Continue in this fashion until the entire toe of the sneaker is covered in crystals.          Once you have finished with the first sneaker, repeat the process with the second one. Then leave the adhesive to set for 15 to 20 minutes. You can use the same technique to add crystals or rhinestones to any part of the sneaker you like -- you bedazzle the entire shoe, or use carefully placed crystals to create stars, hearts and other patterns.  If you used the jewel setter, your crystals or rhinestones may look dull rather than shiny.          This is because they are covered in a layer of wax. Take a clean, dry cloth and use it to buff the crystals until they are clean and shiny. Don't worry if any of the crystals come loose -- just apply another dot of adhesive and stick on a new crystal.	Gather your supplies. Prepare the sneakers. Start adding the crystals. Continue adding crystals. Buff the crystals or rhinestones.
Being able to see properly is key to driving safely any time, especially when visibility is already reduced because of rain. To improve your visibility:Clean the inside and outside of the windows regularly to remove dirt, dust, mud, smoke, fingerprints, grime, and other materials. If your windows fog up, turn on the air conditioning or cold air in the car and aim the vents at the windows. Turn on the rear defroster, and open the windows if necessary to increase the airflow.; , Take your car to a mechanic to have your headlights adjusted properly if you’ve never done this. This will ensure your headlights are pointing in the right direction, make it easier to see, and prevent you from blinding other drivers.Check regularly to make sure none of your lights have burnt out, and replace dead lights immediately. This includes headlights, brake lights, turn signals, tail lights, and running lights. Keep the light covers on your car clean so that dust and dirt don’t reduce their efficacy.  Tire tread is what allows your tires to adhere to the road, which is why it’s so dangerous to drive with bald tires. Without the right traction, you can skid, slide, and hydroplane easily in wet conditions.   New tires generally have about 10/32 of an inch of tread. Tires should be replaced when the tread gets to 4/32 of an inch. Tires with 2/32 of an inch or less of tread are unsafe and shouldn’t be used., Along with keeping your windshield clean, you can also improve your visibility in wet conditions by ensuring that your wipers are up to the job, and by using the right washer fluid.Replace your wipers every year to prevent them from cracking, breaking, or not sealing properly when you need them most. Try a hydrophobic washer fluid that will cause water to bead up and drip off your windshield, rather than sticking to it and blocking your view.  During any inclement weather or unfavorable driving conditions, your first reaction should always be to adjust your speed accordingly. Wet roads reduce your traction, and slowing down reduces the chances of you skidding out, and will give you more time to react to emergencies.   Wet roads can reduce your traction by about a third, so you should also reduce your speed by a third.Even small amounts of water can make the road more slippery, because the water mixes with oils on the road, and this creates a greasy layer. Driving too quickly on wet roads can lead to hydroplaning, which means that your tires lose contact with the road. When a car hydroplanes, you have very little control in terms of steering or braking.  When you're behind the wheel, it’s important to always pay attention to the road, other cars, and pedestrians. This is especially true in the rain, when you cannot see as well, and your ability to stop may be hindered by the slickness of the road. Stay focused by:Keeping your eyes on the road at all times Paying attention to what drivers and pedestrians are doing around you. Turning off the radio, and ignoring your cell phone and other electronic devices. Ceasing any conversations you were having with passengers. Not eating, reading, or putting on makeup while driving.  When it starts to rain, turn on your headlights immediately, regardless of whether it’s day or night. In some states, it’s actually illegal to drive without headlights when it’s raining. There are two reasons why you should drive with your lights on in the rain:   First of all, your headlights will make it easier for other drivers to see your car. Second, rain typically means cloudy skies, and turning your lights on will help you see the road better., You should always drive with your hands at 9 o’clock and 3 o’clock on the steering wheel, because this gives you maximum control if you have to turn, swerve, or react quickly. It’s especially important to have both hands on the wheel when driving conditions are subpar.   While traditional wisdom said to drive with your hands at 10 o’clock and 2 o’clock on the steering wheel, this increases the chances of injury from airbags in case of a collision., You should always leave a three- to four-second gap between your car and the car in front of you, and you should increase this to at least five seconds when it’s raining.Not only does this give you more time to stop or adjust if necessary, but it also prevents reduced visibility caused by the spray from other cars.   To determine how many seconds you are behind another car, make note of when that car passes a landmark (like a street sign) and then count how many seconds it takes before your car passes that same landmark. Leaving space includes leaving an opening where you can escape quickly if necessary. To do this, make sure you always leave at least one open space beside or in front of you that you can move into.  Slamming on the brakes can cause you to slide forward, and you won’t be able to control the car. Hitting the brakes too hard can also force water into your brakes, making them less effective.Instead of braking, you can also slow yourself down by easing off the accelerator, and downshifting if you have a manual transmission. Not being able to stop as quickly in the rain is another reason why it’s so important to leave extra space between your car and the one in front of you.  Turning too quickly on a wet road can cause your tires to hydroplane, and this means you won’t be able to control the car, and could skid out. Whenever you have a turn coming up, signal early and start slowing down sooner than you would in good conditions.Just like with driving, you should reduce the speed of your turns by about a third when it’s raining.  Cruise control is another factor that can lead to hydroplaning. The weight of the car shifts slightly when you ease on or off the accelerator, and this helps the tires maintain traction with the road. But with cruise control, because the speed of the car is constant, there is no weight shift, and the car can lose traction., Never be afraid to pull over to the side of the road if you don’t feel comfortable driving. If you can't see the sides of the road, the cars in front of you, or your surroundings at a safe distance, pull over.Other things that can reduce your visibility include the glare from other car lights and lightning. You may also need to pull over if there's too much water on the road, the road is too slick, or you simply don’t feel safe. To pull over safely, turn on your signal, check your mirror and blind spots, pull over as far as possible to the side of the road, and turn on your four-way lights.  Driving through deep or moving water can be hazardous for a number of reasons, including that you could get stuck, stall out, damage the car or the electrical components, or be swept away.Moving water is too deep if you cannot see the ground. Don’t proceed through deep water if it comes higher than the bottom of your door. If you encounter these types of road flooding, turn around and find another route. In a case where the only route is blocked, pull over and wait out the flooding.  Hydroplaning can occur at speeds as low as 35 miles (56 km) per hour, and when it happens your car may not react when you turn the steering wheel, and your back end may feel loose. In the event that your car does hydroplane:Stay calm Avoid turning the steering wheel Ease your foot off the accelerator Apply slow and gentle pressure to the brakes  , Skidding on a wet road can be particularly frightening, but like any emergency situation, the key is remaining calm. Then, look where you want to go, ease your foot off the accelerator, and gently steer in the direction you want to travel. Avoid braking, and never slam on the brakes.To prevent skidding, always brake before entering a turn or curve, then let your foot off the brake before the turn.	Keep your windows clean and clear. Maintain your lights. Maintain your tires. Turn on your windshield wipers. Slow down. Stay focused. Turn your lights on. Drive with both hands on the wheel. Stay five seconds behind the car in front of you. Avoid slamming on the brakes. Take turns slowly. Don’t use cruise control. Pull over if necessary. Turn around if you encounter deep or moving water. Be prepared to react if you hydroplane. Know what to do if you start to skid.
You will only need:Scissors. Paper (best if it is somewhat rigid). Tape  , Any size will do, but obviously a small sheet of paper will make a small hoop.  You will create a crease that ends at the midpoint of the top and bottom sides.  Make sure that you make all of your folds in the same direction; in other words, do not make one fold toward you and the other fold away from you. All of the creases (including those in the next step) must leave an imprint on the paper point the same direction.  Make sure that each corner and the sides match up perfectly as you fold. The paper should now have four creases in it, and will almost take a pyramid shape if left to sit on its own. It will only come together correctly if all four of the creases meet at a single central point.  Do not bent against the creases you created earlier. As you bend the four together, the diagonal creases will flow outward. The paper should appear to be a triangle if looked at from the side and a four-pointed star if viewed from above.  You may be able to get the hoop to maintain its shape just by flexing the paper (especially if the paper is rigid). If the paper will not maintain the hoop shape on its own, you can tape the tips together.   The tip of the triangle or pyramid from earlier is now usually considered the top. As you fold the tips together you may note how easily they form a basket that opens wider toward the top.  Again, masking tape usually works best.	Obtain the necessary materials to make the hoop. Cut the paper into a perfect square. Fold the paper in half top-to-bottom, and then unfold it. Then fold and unfold the paper again, this time left-to right. Fold and unfold the paper along both diagonals. Fold all four of the mid-side crease points together at once. Curt two adjacent tips of the paper toward each other to make a hoop. Attach the basket to a wall with tape.
This type of cast-off requires two knitting needles. It will create a tight edge without much stretchiness. Replace your right-hand needle with a larger one if you want it to have a little more give., It often works best to continue following the project's pattern on this row, though you can also knit or purl across. This will leave you with two stitches on your right-hand needle and the rest of the project still on your left-hand needle.  Use your fingers to gently lift it up and over. The second stitch will now form a loop around the yarn leading to the first. Keep the remaining first stitch on the right-hand needle.  The new stitch should now be the one closest to the point of your right needle, while what was previously the first stitch is now the second. Continue to follow the project's pattern if you're using one. These stitches will functionally be your final row.  Keep adding another stitch to the right needle and pulling the older stitch over it and off the needle. Work until the last stitch of your project is alone on your right needle. Be extra careful when doing these stitches, as they will make up the edge of your project. The quality of the stitching will be much more apparent than with the inner rows.  Make sure to leave a tail of free yarn between one to five inches long. Leave a longer tail if you plan to sew or weave this piece to another. For weaving, leave at least 12 inches.  Remove your piece from the right-hand needle. Tug the tail until the final loop is closed and secure. Trim off any extra tail yarn unless you will be adding to it later as previously discussed.	Pause before starting what will be your project's final row. Start by doing only the first two stitches of the final row. Pull the second stitch on the right-hand needle over the first and off the needle. Add another stitch on the last row. Repeat the process as described above. Cut the yarn to free your project. Pull the tail through the loop of the final stitch.
If choosing root division, divide the roots in spring or autumn.; , Echinacea likes light, loamy soil. While it likes full sun, it will also tolerate dappled shade. Also ensure that the site is open and airy as echinacea is prone to mildew; look for the hot, dry spot in the garden.  The soil should be kept moist.  The roots and rhizomes can be harvested in autumn/fall. If using in tinctures, you'll need to dry the root or rhizome first.   This plant will self-seed readily provided it had adequate mid-summer watering.	Choose to grow from seed or root division. Select a suitable part of the garden. Water regularly. Harvest.
Make sure all buttons/zippers/designs etc. are above your cut. Cut it at the length you want it to be. If you want to carry books and heavy items, use a heavier and larger shirt. If it's just for clothes or beach items, any shirt would work. Cut a straight line across. Using a pencil or chalk and a ruler to get a straight line. Don't throw away the sleeves though.; , This will be the top of the bag. Notice how it is already sewn for you.  Use a double stitch for support. , Do not cut the sleeves shorter than they already are. Cut a straight line where the curve for your armpit stops. Make sure the bottom it all straight. One sleeve is good for both straps.  This will result in one piece of flat fabric.  This divides it into two straps. Make sure both are equal in length and width.  Press the sleeves flat. This step is optional.  Make sure your bag is still inside out while you are sewing.	Cut your shirt. Turn the shirt inside-out and make sure the lower hem is at the top. Sew the bottom cut together. Press all seams.  , Cut the sleeves for straps. Cut the sleeve open. Cut your sleeve in half lengthwise. Sew hems on both straps for a clean finish. Sew your straps on your bag. Turn the bag right side out and use.
This can help you to know what it's about and what others have thought of it. You can read reviews to see what others have to say about it and how many stars they rate it. And if you don't mind spoilers, you can read a synopsis of the film. For some people, knowing what will happen reduces the fear but not the thrill because it helps take the edge off.   Try looking up the plot on Wikipedia or IMDB (Internet Movie Database) beforehand if you don't mind spoiling the movie for yourself. It helps to know what happens when, so if you think you might get scared by that part, go to the bathroom or get a refill on snacks.; , Perhaps the content is not of interest to you or maybe the reviews have canned the film and it seems a waste of time. Or, perhaps the reviews are glowing and you're keen to find out more. Decide whether or not you want to watch the horror movie.  A way to stop getting scared is by watching the non-gory ones first, the ones with a great deal of suspense, and slowly move into the most frightening and gory ones. Keep in mind that gory does not mean scary and the movies are not necessarily scarier when they're gorier. Some horror movies without blood are actually scarier than some of the really gory horror movies.  If it is dark you may not want to have to wander the halls alone.  Having some comfort objects might help you to feel safer and will provide something for you to clench if the movie gets especially scary for you.  There's no need to be trialing this alone!   Never watch alone if the movie is really scary. Watch it with people like your family members or friends. This will help.  If you're really scared, you can watch the movie through your fingers.  Or, turn away. , Reminding yourself that it's just a movie with special effects (and sometimes a bad script) can help you to remember that it's just a gory play on film and not reality.   Try laughing at all the unrealistic parts. For example: Bad effects for blood, unrealistic bodies, fake fear, dumb-looking monsters, etc.  Notice how the scenes were created so you can know how unreal the movie really is. This can help prepare you for future horror movies too.  Something loud, horrific and gory is probably going to happen.	Read about the movie before you watch it. Use what you've read about the movie to decide whether or not you want to watch it. Consider starting with the right level of horror movie. Go to the bathroom before starting the movie, especially if it's at night. Gather together some pillows and blankets to make a cozy area or even a fort. Watch it with someone else. Peek rather than watch. Cover your eyes during the scary parts. Peek through your fingers slowly, and then cover your eyes again.  , Keep saying to yourself, "This is not real!", Watch the commercials on how the movies were made. When there is suspenseful music playing, brace yourself.
In order to create a smooth braid, you will need to have tangle-free hair. Freshly washed hair is the most difficult to braid because it is so slick, so use one day old (or several days old) dirty hair for your headband. You can use wet or dry hair, although if you begin with wet hair it will be wavy when you remove it from your braid at the end of the day.; , Your braid will be giving the illusion of a headband, so it needs to cross from ear to ear. Use a comb to create a smooth, even part running horizontally across your head from behind one ear to the back of another. Try to avoid any jagged lines or waves in your part; the straighter the line the better it will look. Pull back the rest of your hair into a ponytail.  Comb your hair horizontally across your head, starting at the base of one ear. When it is smooth, section your hair into three even pieces at the base of your hair.  Use the three pieces of hair to start a traditional braid. Take the section on the right, and cross it over the middle section of hair. Then, do the same with the left section, crossing it over the middle piece.  As you braid, pick up small pieces of hair from your parted section in addition to your regular three sections. Pick up a piece on the right, add it to the right strand, and cross it over the center. Pick up a piece on the left, add it to the left strand, and cross it over the center.  Work your way across your head above your hairline, adding in more strands of hair as you go. Your braid may have been thin to start, but will begin gathering size as you add more strands.  As you get close to your ear, finish the braid by tying it off with a small clear elastic. The loose ends of the braid will blend in with your hair down, or can be incorporated into an updo. You can also choose to braid your hair in a regular braid to the very ends, and then tie the tips off with a ponytail.	Brush your hair. Create your part. Section your hair. Begin braiding. Incorporate more strands. Continue braiding. Finish your braid.

Belts make a good base for a guitar strap. Find an old belt that you don’t use anymore. You will be removing the buckle that makes the belt useful for clothing. You are basically going to strip the belt of any extra parts and leave the belt in its raw state.  Use scissors or a sharp blade to remove the buckle from the belt. Place the belt around your shoulder as you might hold a guitar. Most belts will need to be cut to better fit a guitar. You can also make adjustments so that the strap can be adjusted.; , Use a strong string material like paracord for the guitar strap. Don’t use anything too slim or else it may break. If you have extra rope, you can arrange multiple lines for the strap by twisting or gluing them together. Measure the string by draping it over your shoulder and hold your guitar.A good length is one that will allow you to make adjustments. You might need a friend to help you measure the strap.  Instead of a belt or string you could also use fabric as the base of your guitar strap. It will be important to layer the fabrics on top of each other to create a durable base. Arrange about three or four layers of fabric on top of each other and then cut out an outline for the strap. Measure out the width of the shoulder the strap will rest on.  A durable fabric like denim may work best. Trace the dimension onto the layered fabrics before cutting. Attempt to make a clean cut. Attach the fabrics together by sewing them or by using glue. Many synthetic fibers like acrylic tend be more durable than natural fibers., Go to a linens shop and search through the raw linens. This is the best way to find a unique fabric design that you can use for your guitar strap. There are plenty of options for the guitar strap’s design. Pick out a fabric design that suits your style and music.  For instance, classic paisley is a design that was popular in the late 1960s.  Look through your wardrobe or linens closets to see if you have anything that you don't use anymore. This is a great way to truly personalize your strap. If you have a favorite t-shirt or bed sheet that you no longer use, it could be great as a cover for your guitar strap base. This will add an element from your past that could inspire you to play a certain way.  Use something that you'll feel comfortable playing with. Don't choose something that you might be embarrassed by. Tie die will especially look good if you like this type of look.  The fabric you selected will act as a cover for the base of your strap. Lay out the base of your strap on a surface and wrap the fabric over the base. Make sure the fabric fits tight around the base. Once your cover is snug and covering the base, cut off any excess fabric from the cover. Sew the cover onto the base using a simple cross stitch. The base of the strap should stay in one place and not move around too much.  It may benefit you to glue your fabric to the base before sewing to ensure everything stays in place. Don’t forget to sew the fabric at the ends of the strap closed.  You can add plenty of extra features and designs, based on your style. Some players will choose a minimal strap design, while others like to make their strap burst with personality. You can add studs if you’re into hard rock or metal. You can also be creative and stitch patches or other linens to the strap.Add fray to your strap if you want to have an eccentric cowboy look. You could even glue glitter onto your strap. This style works well for glam rock.  The second most important area of the strap is the shoulder section that will be holding the brunt of the weight. This is where comfort comes into play, which is very important if you're going to be standing for an extended period of time.   The wider the strap at this area, the more space the weight will be distributed over, and the less sore your shoulder will be! Padding is a great thing to add to this area as well. Foam or a similar material can easily be attached to the underside of the strap using glue or needle and thread. You can get fancy and glue Velcro onto the padding and the strap for removable padding. If you construct your strap with two pieces of material, you can sandwich padding between them.  You can setup your guitar strap to fit the strap pegs using string. The string you choose needs to be a durable material like paracord. You should also try to use a thin string. Create a hole in the guitar strap using an awl or leather punch. Create a hole just large enough to weave the string through.  Tie the string to the top end of the guitar strap and connect it to the top strap peg on the guitar. You can alternatively use a knife or scissors but an awl or leather punch will be easier. Consider a good length for your guitar strap before attaching the string - string can be difficult to adjust later if you change your mind.  You can buy authentic guitar strap tips that you can attach to your homemade strap. This is a good way to ensure your guitar strap will be secure enough to hold the guitar while playing. You can either find these online or make them yourself. You need a strip of leather to make them from home.  Measure out the width of the strap and outline that width on the leather. Cut out two pieces of leather. Look at guitar straps for an example of the end’s curvature. The end typically gets narrower towards the hole.  One end of your custom strap should allow you to easily adjust the looseness of your guitar. The best way to do this for your strap is to create a series of holes to fit the bottom strap peg on your guitar. It is easier to make an adjustment from the bottom. A leather punch will be the easiest way to create even holes.Use a blade to create a series of holes that are about an inch apart. Don’t make the hole too big for the strap peg. The idea is to make the strap fit onto the guitar snugly.	Use a belt. Get a length of string or rope. Use fabric. Find and use a decorative fabric to add some color to your base.

Sweep or blow away all the dirt and debris from the concrete steps. Also, make sure to cover up any nearby plants with a plastic covering like a tarp or trash bags.Remove toys, decorations, and nearby furniture as well.  Mix them together in a plastic bucket until they are well-combined. The temperature of the water should be at least 105 degrees Fahrenheit (40.5 degrees Celsius).Alternatively, you can use a specially formulated concrete cleaner instead of the oxygenated bleach and water. You can find these at your local hardware store.  Fill a tank sprayer with the solution. Working from the top down, use the tank to spray the steps with the solution, focusing on the stained areas. Once you have covered the whole area, let the solution set for 20 to 30 minutes.Make sure the concrete steps are soaking wet to prevent the solution from drying up while it is setting. If the solution starts to dry, then just spray more solution onto the steps. You can purchase or rent a tank sprayer from your local hardware store.  You can also use a push broom to do this. Working from the top down, scrub the steps until the dirt and grime are completely removed. Use a smaller scrub brush to clean small crevices and corners.Make sure to clean the steps evenly to avoid a patchy look.  Fill a gallon bucket with clean, hot water. From the top of the stairs, pour the water down the steps to rinse them clean. Rinse the steps until all of the soap residue, dirt, and grime are removed.If the concrete steps are still dirty, then repeat steps one through five, or use a different method.

There are several types of swings available. For instance, you might choose a wicker porch swing, a metal porch swing, or a wooden porch swing. You can get porch swings in a rainbow of colors, so choose a color that suits your porch and pleases the eye.There is no functional difference associated with the different types of colors or materials of the porch swing. Your choice of swing is entirely based on your personal preference.; , Chains of stainless or galvanized steel are the most common option. However, if you’d rather have a hanging porch swing with a more rustic look, you could use marine-grade braided nylon rope or polyester rope.Your ropes or chains will likely need to be at least seven feet long. If you use rope, ensure it is at least ¾’’ (19 millimeters) thick. Whatever you choose, ensure you obtain two equal lengths of each, one for each end of your porch swing. If you choose to hang your swing with rope, check it regularly for signs of wear like fraying threads.  You should plan on your porch swing moving through an arc that extends through about four feet of space. In other words, hang your porch swing at a spot with at least three feet of space in front and in back of it. Use a measuring tape to determine where your porch swing would fit best.If you’re hanging a prefabricated A-frame porch swing, you won’t need to look for beams and joists in your porch ceiling, but you will still need to ensure your porch is deep enough to accommodate the A-frame. Compare the frame’s depth against your porch’s before purchasing.	Choose your swing. Choose between steel chains or rope. Give your swing lots of space.
Lampworking is the process of manipulating molten glass over a small torch. Lampworking is used to create beads, for example, or other smaller objects, like paperweights. This section will focus on how to lampwork a small bead.  You could use an oxygen and propane fed torch if you have access to one.  Try to get a stainless steel mandrel with a ceramic coating. The ceramic coating will keep the molten glass from sticking to the mandrel when you want to take it off.  If you don't flash the glass, it could go into shock and shatter instead of becoming molten. Flash for about 30 seconds.  Hold it in the flame until a nice orange ball develops.   Keep rotating your glass so that it maintains its round shape.    Place the glass onto the mandrel and begin wrapping the mandrel away from your body. Wrap until you have full coverage on your mandrel. Use the torch flame to sever the glass rod from the mandrel. It's easiest to cut the glass away from its source when both it and the mandrel are in the flame.    If desired, add another color to the existing bead. Do this by following Steps #4 through #7, all while rotating the mandrel and occasionally dipping it back into the flame. This is not for beginners, as it requires dexterity and use of both hands simultaneously.  Use the paddle to:   Create better edges Create square shapes Help even out the contours of a curve.	Use lampworking for smaller glass objects. Turn on your torch. Heat the mandrel up in the blow torch slow. Flash the glass through the tip of flame to prime it. Start bringing the glass closer to the heart of the flame. Attach the molten tip of the glass to the mandrel. Introduce the mandrel with the glass bead back into the flame, rotating to keep the glass from slipping down. Take the mandrel out of the flame and shape, as necessary, with a graphite paddle. Allow the mandrel to cool off a bit before taking it to the annealer, rotating all the while.
If you have performed well as an amateur an owner might ask for you to drive for their team. These teams are often owned by car companies and have their own sponsorships to cover costs. They usually sign their drivers on a season-to-season basis.  Most Formula 1 drivers have some sponsors that require additional work off the track. To attract sponsors you need to have success on the track and a positive public opinion. You may have to do appearances or photo shoots for your sponsor in addition to your on-track work. Racing is a very expensive sport, so drivers must look to add to supplement their racing income whenever possible.  Pay drivers are common in many levels of motorsports, including Formula 1. Instead of being paid by the race team, the driver uses money from sponsorships or their personal fortune to fund the racing operations.While this isn't practical for most new racers in Formula 1, it is an option if you have the ability to pay for it.	Accept an offer to drive for an F1 team. Getting sponsorships. Pay to drive in F1.
You must remove everything covering the "rough frame" of the doorway.The majority of doors for sale on the market today come pre-hung--that is, they are already mounted on a door jamb. When installed correctly, they provide the tightest possible seal to keep out the elements. The door jamb is usually held in place with nails, screws, and caulk. The screws shouldn't be difficult to remove, though the caulk can sometimes be a challenge to strip out. Certain silicone-based caulks or sealants can be loosed with specialized chemical applications available at many hardware stores. Exterior molding may come off only with great difficulty; there is usually no special trick to it, just the application of leverage via a pry bar. Pry off interior trim carefully, so as not to damage the surrounding wall paint or paper. Along with a pry bar, it may be helpful to use a putty knife to get between the trim and wall with minimal damage.; , Use a level to measure the sill (bottom), sides, and top of the frame. If it is not as it should be, you may need to add wood around the frame to make it level.The most common cause of difficulties is the sill. If it is exposed to weather, it is the most likely portion to be warped or rotted. In this case, remove the existing materials and replace them with like-sized boards.  You must measure the height, width, and depth in order to know the precise size you must have for the door you will purchase.   Do not underestimate the importance of measuring the depth. If the distance between the interior and exterior walls is great but the depth of door jamb on the new door you purchase is small, you will have to add jamb extensions. This shouldn't be too much of a problem unless the distance you have to make up is especially large, but it is something to be aware of.  Aside from the pre-hung door, there are a few other things you will need:   Wooden shims to hold the new door in place as you attach it to the frame. Screws or nails to secure the door in place. Make sure the nails or screws you select are of an appropriate length for the jamb and frame you will be nailing through. An electric drill set to pre-drill any holes and drive in the screws that will attach the door. Caulk or other form of exterior sealant to prevent leaks around the edges of the jamb. A drip cap and sill pan (optional), to protect the upper and lower portions of any doorway that be exposed directly to the elements.  After you have the door in place you will no longer have access to these areas. In particular, look for any remaining uneven spots that can be filled in to prevent air leaks or the collection of water. Especially focus on the sill area. The caulk will dry slowly, so it should still be pliable when you fit the new door into place., It is usually easiest to move the bottom of the door to the doorway and then raise the whole door unit into the frame.   Push shims into the spaces along the sides and top of the jamb to make the door fit snugly in place. You may only be able to do this from the interior side of the house as many exterior doors have molding around the exterior side of the jamb that will limit access to any gap.Check to make sure the door is level before you nail or screw the door into its final position.  Nail or screw through the jamb into the frame at several points to ensure that it is held firmly in place.   Most pre-hung doors will also come with a few long screws that are specifically designed to anchor the door itself into the frame. Remove a few of the short screws that attach the door to the jamb and replace these with the long screws.  The sill pan will just screw or nail into place over the sill region, and the cap will have to be attached where the exterior molding meets the outside wall.  You must cover any remaining gaps to prevent air leaks or water damage.	Remove the old door and the surrounding trim, molding, and door jamb. Determine if the doorway is level. Measure the doorway. Purchase the necessary materials and tools. Pre-caulk the hard to reach areas inside the frame of the door. Set the door in place. Secure the door into the frame. Install the sill pan and drip cap. Caulk around the edges to make sure the seal it complete.
Even if you don’t feel like your space is overly messy, take time to intentionally de-clutter. You might be surprised by how much you have accumulated. Eliminating excess is an essential component of making your space feel peaceful.   Look to the cultural phenomenon, Marie Kondo, for her famous de-cluttering practices. Ask yourself what items in your bedroom truly give you joy.Put these items in a definitely keep pile. Make other piles to donate, to recycle, and to throw away. Make an immediate trip to the donation center so that you don’t put it off. If there are any items you’re unsure about giving up, box them up, date the box, and put them away in a closet. If you don’t reach for any of them within six months, give the box away without even opening it. Include furniture. Does your furniture add to the space? If not, do you need it, and if so, do you have funds to find something else?; , After you’ve de-cluttered, this is a guaranteed way to make your space feel fresh.   Get to all the tasks you don’t think about in your normal cleaning routine.Dust your baseboards, molding, and ceiling fans, and clean the glass of mirrors and windows. If you have curtains, take them down and wash them. Sweep and mop hardwood floors, and thoroughly vacuum carpet. Make sure to also clean under your bed. If you have furniture against your walls, move it a few inches so you can clean behind it. Use a magic eraser, like Mr. Clean’s, to get any scuff marks off your walls.  If you compare effect to price, painting your room is an inexpensive way to make a drastic update to your space. Stick to more neutral colors that you won’t grow to dislike over time.   Shades of white work well in any space. White paint will make your room feel brighter and more open. It’s a calming color and good backdrop to make decorations pop. If you want a little more drama in your space, try painting your walls a velvety black or navy blue.A darker room done right can feel cozy and timeless. Be wary of these colors, however, if your space already feels a little cramped. If you don’t want to paint your entire room, paint an accent wall on the wall behind your bed.If you like your current paint color, just do a few touch ups with a paint brush.  Whether you’re planning a complete makeover or just a small refresh, it can help to create your vision for the space. This will keep your process and outcome cohesive.   Choose a color scheme. Pick a neutral base and a few coordinating accent colors for decorations like coral, teal, and mustard yellow. When you are choosing items to bring to your room, refer back to see if they loosely fit this scheme. Think about how you want your space to feel. Do you want it to be minimalist, crisp, and bright, or cozily full of sweet, quirky items and various patterns? Do you want wood in your room or accents of metal? As you begin to update your space, think about whether the changes fit into your vision for the space.  Just the small change of moving your bed can make you feel like you have a brand new room. Your bed should be the focal point of this space.Try to move your bed against a different wall, and reorganize your other furniture based on the placement of your bed. You don’t have to place your bed against the wall. Consider putting your bed a diagonal or leaving it to float free in your space.  Or, if you don’t already have a headboard, add one. This is a way to give plain furniture a little bit of style.   Your headboard doesn’t have to be a standard frame or hard headboard because it isn’t structurally important to your bed. Consider hanging a piece of art: an oversized poster or a woven tapestry work well.You can even hang a woven rug on your wall as a tapestry. If you have a plush headboard, recover it. New fabric will give an instant face lift to your bed. Use a corkboard or pegboard. You can paint it the color of your choice and constantly change the pictures and mementos you hang from it. Paint a mural above your bed or adorn it with wall decals.This will give you a more intricate image than you’d get with a traditional headboard.  The lighting in your bedroom creates ambience and mood. Consider adding new lighting for more sources of soft light. The more sources of lower wattage light you have in a room, the better.If you are able, install dimmers on your lights, so you can change the brightness of your lights. Keep practicality in mind. You’ll need a lamp by your bedside, and you might want a stylish nightlight near your bathroom.  Certain types of light can add decor even while off. Consider stringing up a few strands of decorative fairy lights. Depending on the style of your space, you can find different shapes and themes in these string lights.   Pretty candles, whether they are real or artificial, can add a soft, relaxing glow to your space at night. You can even keep an entire shelf of varying sizes of candles.  This is a simple way to make your doors and furniture seem new.   Depending on your vision, choose sleek and metal minimalistic hardware or bright focal points like crystal door knobs and painted ceramic hardware. You can even get creative and make your own hardware.You can use anything from ribbon to yardsticks or old cutlery.  As you redecorate, don’t feel like you need to buy new pieces of artwork all at once. Fill your space slowly with things you love.   If you want a clean look to your walls, get your art and pictures framed and hang them equally spaced apart.For a more organic look, hang unframed artwork with pretty pins or washi tape tacked in the corners.  A new duvet or quilt can make a huge difference in the way you feel about relaxing in your bedroom.   Think about getting a fluffy white comfortable and white pillowcases. The white looks bright, soft, and inviting. If it gets dirty, you can simply bleach it back to its original bright white. If you don’t want white, choose a pattern you love. Feel free to mix a patterned quilt with different patterned pillows for a more textural look. Get new sheets. This is a small luxury that can make you more comfortable. Opt for 100% cotton or linen sheets, which will only get softer with time and will last for years.  Even if you already have carpet in your room, an area rug can add an element of comfort, style, and fun.Choose a bright patterned rug if the rest of your space is fairly minimal. This is a great way to add art and whimsy without cluttering your walls. Add a soft, shag rug. These are great to put around your bed so that your feet will sink into them each morning as you get up.  Plants not only make a space prettier, they also purifier the air and make you calmer.   When picking plants for your space, make sure to take into account the amount of sunlight your room gets.For lower maintenance plants, choose succulents and cacti. Use large baskets and beautiful ceramic pots as decorative holders for your plants.  Even though you can’t see it, scent plays a part in the decorative feel of your room. Using aromatherapy can help you create your ideal relaxing environment.Invest in candles, incense, or an essential oil diffuser for your bedside. Scents like lavender, jasmine, and rosemary are calming and clarifying.	De-clutter your bedroom. Give your room a deep clean. Consider painting. Make a mood board for your bedroom. Reposition your bed. Change your headboard. Rethink your functional lighting. Add decorative lighting. Change out hardware on doors and furniture. Hang pictures and artwork that mean something to you. Update your bedspread and pillows. Consider an area rug. Add life to your space. Add scent.
The takeoff ramp needs to be curved up to a steep lip about 45-75 degrees at the top, or else you overshoot and crash.  Remember that when you compact the dirt mounds, they get smaller. One good way not to push the wheelbarrow all the time is to put one and half times what you desire to have as the height of the jump (for example, a beginner that wants a jump 3 feet high actually needs 4.5 feet of dirt because of the loss from compaction) so you won't waste time shoveling again and pushing that wheelbarrow every time you need a little dirt. Make the lip of the jump flat so you can get as much air as possible.       ; , Another good idea is to use a roller this will help compact your jump and make them smoother and better. If the spaded shovel doesn't help just get a compacter and pack it down.  In addition, it makes the dirt more malleable.  Make them progressively bigger. Add berms and rollers to maintain and gather speed.  If in a tight area, just land & slow down, turn around, and do it again.	Mound rocks and logs in two piles and add dirt on top of it about as high as your skill level (2-3 feet for beginners and 5-9 feet for experts, the gap (if you feel like you are certain to crash, do a jump instead) needs to be 2–5 feet (0.6–1.5 m) for beginners and 8–15 feet (2.4–4.6 m) for experts). Compact the ramps down by hitting them with a flat spade or stamping on them. Add water to the dirt jump so it doesn't become dusty and break apart in clumps, and so it's easier to pack down. Make multiple jumps in a row, also known as a rhythm section. Focus on a set up that flows.
Boysenberries enjoy mild winters and warm summers.; , Add a lot of well-rotted manure to the ground before planting.  The best method for growing boysenberries is to place a two-wire trellis system in the planting area. Erect this prior to planting.   Tie the fruiting canes to the top wire of the two-wire trellis. Use the second wire to train new growth that will fruit in the following year. , The main difference is that boysenberries require a lot more vigorous pruning to prevent their growth from getting out of hand.  A well tended boysenberry plant should produce fruit well for up to 15 years. Expect about 5kg of fruit each season from each plant.   Cut back the top growing canes (the ones attached to the top wire) at the end of the harvest. Cut them down to ground level. In turn, transfer the new growth canes to the top wire level in readiness for next season.  Boysenberries can be made into ice cream, baked in cakes, pies, and crumbles, or enjoyed fresh on their own or with a dollop of cream or ice cream.	Ensure that you have a suitable climate. Prepare the soil. Prepare a trellis system. Space boysenberry plants 2 meters (6.6 ft) apart.  , Use the same methods for growing boysenberries as for growing raspberries. Harvest the boysenberries when ready. Enjoy the harvest.
To generalize trance or house as "techno" is like generalizing death metal as "rock". Be willing to listen to new music and search "What is electronic music?" In the broadest sense, any music incorporating electronic elements ("instruments", samples, synthesis, effects) can be considered electronic. Most popular music today could meet this definition.; , Electronic music commonly uses drum machines, samples (sound clips), and/or synthesizers and effects processors.  Tempo (song speed) is often measured in Beats Per Minute (BPM), and electronic music songs may vary widely in BPM.	Don't use the word "techno" as a catch-all term for all electronic music. Understand electronic music composition. Understand that not all electronic music is fast or meant for dancing.
Depending on your reasons for making the video, you may want to invest in a high-quality camera to create a professional-looking project, or you may want to use whatever is available for a cheaper option. Whatever the case, getting a camera to shoot video on should be your first step.    Cellphone videos are super-cheap and really easy to use. They can be a little shaky, however, and the sound is usually not very good, but if you want to grab some video quickly and easily, the camera on your cell is a good option.  Digital photo cameras regularly have video features, and some are quite cheap and fairly high-quality. Cameras with SD cards are widely available and user-friendly.  HD Cameras can run anywhere between a few hundred and a few thousand dollars and will look very professional. Many low-budget Hollywood movies have been shot on basic HD cameras you can buy at electronics stores like Best Buy, or even explore renting options in your area.; , Whether you're shooting a birthday party, concert, a wedding, or some other event, get to the place early and do some scouting to see the right angles for shooting video. Find a few comfortable positions and shoot from multiple angles to get different footage that you'll be able to edit together later into a nice product.   If you've got a helper, you can shoot simultaneously from different angles to provide cuts in your finished product with editing. This can be a cool effect that will make your finished product seem finished and professional. Try to stay out of peoples' way, especially if there's a sizable crowd. You want to get the close shot and the right angle, but you're not the only one there. Make sure everyone can see and shoot from a reasonable distance., To be ready for spontaneous moments, keep the camera going! Pick the right time to start and let the camera warm up, so the video begins before the actual action you want to capture. If you Try to fire up the camera when you see your kid sprinting toward the goal, ready to take a shot in the championship soccer game, it's likely you'll miss it. If you've been filming since half-time, though, you'll be ready.   Don't try to edit together your video on the fly. It's better to avoid lots of stops and starts to the video, because you'll have trouble remember what shot happened when, which will be much easier to sort out if you've got longer shots. You can edit out the unnecessary bits later, but most cameras have lots of room on them, so take advantage of it.  If you're using the camera on your cellphone, or any camera that isn't steadied with a tripod, Try to hold it as steady as possible. Shakiness and blurriness from an unsteady hand can make important video footage frustrating and unwatchable. Sit down while shooting and steady your arms on your knees, if necessary, or invest in a tripod that'll keep the camera steady on the ground.   A common mistake on iPhone cameras involves holding the phone vertically while taking video, as opposed to horizontally. When you upload the video to your computer later to edit it (if you want to) you'll have annoying bars on either side of the screen. Shoot the "landscape" style and hold the camera long-ways. It'll show up sideways on your phone, but you can tilt it later on your computer and it'll look right.  If you're just using the built-in mic on your camera and not trying to capture sound with other microphones, you'll have a lot of trouble hearing the action unless you're quite close.	Get a camera. Find the best angles. Keep rolling. Stay as steady as possible. Get as close as possible if you want to capture sound.
You do not need to own a Mother-of-Thousands plant, but you need access to one with plantlets.; , As Mother-of-Thousands grows, small plantlets, similar to buds, grow along the ridges of plant leaves. Take more than one, because the plantlets can easily die. Do not worry about harming the plant itself by taking the plantlets. They all fall off anyway, and the Mother-of-Thousands will have more energy to grow when it does not have to support the plantlets anymore.  Keep them in the bag until you can transplant the plantlets. Don't let them dry up, or they will die.  It does not need to be deep. The roots will not be very deep at first, so a large bowl is not necessary.  They do not need to be pushed into the soil. Mother-of-Thousands naturally propagates by dropping its plantlets.  This will help keep moisture in, as well as working as a makeshift greenhouse.  Windowsills work wonders, but remember that the more sun the plantlets get, the more attention you will need to give them.  Mother-of-Thousands is a succulent, which means it does not need much water. It does need moisture to stimulate the growth of roots, though.  Stimulated by the moisture and the soil, the plant grows roots via mitosis of meristematic-type tissue in notches in the leaves. You may start to see small, thin, white roots sprout from the base of the plantlets. Make sure you keep an eye on the moisture and height of the plantlets.  They are now ready to stretch for the sun!  , You can test the plant lets by gently lifting them. Be careful when doing this; you can damage the small roots if are too rough. , Unfortunately, some species of Mother-of-Thousands, and their lookalikes can die after blooming small purple-pink flowers late in life. Not all plants will develop these flowers, it happens very sporadically if at all. Their life-span can be extended in preparation for the appearance of flowers by simply watering it less once it grows to about 1 foot (0.3 m) to 1.5 feet (0.5 m). Be careful not to let it get dehydrated, there is a fine line between too much and too little water. If it does look like its life is about to end, simply take a couple of its plantlets and grow a new plant or two.	Find a friend or garden with a Mother-of-Thousands plant. Pick some plantlets. Store the plantlets in a plastic bag. Fill a shallow bowl with potting soil. Place the plantlets gently on the surface of the soil, approximately three quarters of an inch (2 centimeters) to one inch (2.5 centimeters) apart. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Take the plantlets to a sunny place. Keep the soil moist, not wet. Wait, monitor and observe. Remove the plastic wrap from the bowl when the plants are too tall for it. Replant to more appropriate pots or bowls when the plantlets have grown significant roots. Enjoy your newly-propagated Mother-of-Thousands!  , Prepare for the plant to die after it flowers.
Using vinegar, baking soda, and water is an effective, eco-friendly method of unclogging your pipes. The baking soda and hot water will loosen up any build-up that’s clogging your waste pipe, and the chemical reaction from the vinegar will cause the sludge to move on down the drain.   Start by pouring a pot of boiling water down your drain. After you do this, pour 1/2 cup of baking soda down the drain and let it sit for 5 minutes. Follow this with a solution of 1 cup vinegar and 1 cup very hot water. Let it sit for 10 minutes. Pour one more pot of boiling water down the drain to flush away the scum that has been loosened up by the baking soda and vinegar.; , One of the most common ways to clean out your waste pipes is to purchase liquid drain cleaner at your local convenience store. These chemical solutions are often very effective, but can sometimes cause damage to pipes if they are old or worn down.   Popular liquid drain cleaners include Drano, Liquid Plumr, and Rid-X. The instructions for these products will be included on the bottle, but you will typically use an entire bottle to unclog stopped up pipes. The chemical solution will need to sit in place for awhile, but be sure to rinse it out with hot water before taking a bath or shower.  Some people prefer to use powder based cleaners as opposed to liquid ones, as they are less corrosive on the pipes. Most of these powders contain the chemical Sodium Hydroxide, which works quickly to unclog drains. Because it works quickly, the product doesn't need to sit in the clogged drain for long periods of time to be effective.   Popular powder cleaners are Thrift and Drain Care. When using these products, let hot water run through the pipes for 1-2 minutes before pouring the powder down the drain. Use roughly 2 cups of powder (more or less depending on the size of the drain), and let the powder sit for 2 minutes before rinsing with hot water., Chemical substances work by dissolving the scum, hair, and dirt that tends to clog drains and waste pipes. Because of this, these chemical products are usually extremely corrosive and may be harmful on older pipes. Take extreme caution when handling these products, as they can sometimes cause injury to your skin.   To be extra cautious, only handle these products while wearing rubber gloves.	Make your own unclogging mixture out of household supplies. Purchase liquid cleaners to unclog your pipes. Use a powder solution to clean your waste pipes. Be careful when using chemical substances.
There is a long-standing myth in the music industry that the old-fashioned fix of recording a song, placing it in an envelope and mailing it to oneself guaranteed copyright. The post date on the stamp was supposed to serve as proof of the date of origin of the song, provided the envelope remained sealed. However, this method didn't stand up in various court cases and has since been discredited.Moreover, given that your copyright exists on creation, and that an envelope's seal can be carefully unsealed and resealed, this method does seem rather fallible.  If your country is a member of the Berne Convention, copyright in a song comes into existence when you create it. It does become more complicated when there are several creators who have contributed to the song, but there are rules governing these "layers." It's best to seek legal advice in that situation.   The U.S. copyright office is the only one among the Berne Convention's member countries offering a method to register content of the song (lyrics, melody, chord, etc). Unfortunately in all other countries, only the title of the song is recorded. The value of the protection afforded is significantly reduced.	Avoid poor man's copyright. Be aware of the Berne Convention.
Instead of going on a walk, go on a wander. Instead of walking somewhere you go all the time, walk on streets you don't know well. Take public transportation to a park, lake, or other natural space you haven't visited. Take your cell phone, take a friend with ou if you want, and let your family know that you are wandering.   Take a map and draw a wiggly path on it without looking. Challenge yourself to walk along the path you drew as closely as you can. Make sure it loops you back home!  , Is there a downtown or shopping center where you live? Go to stores you have never entered. Challenge yourself to find something you like in each place. You don't have to buy anything, but try to get a sense of what you would buy if you were someone who shopped there. Each store is selling an image, so explore the ways those images can fit you or not.   For instance, you could visit an vintage store and explore dated fashion and obsolete technology. Imagine what it was like to wear a corset, wear a hat every day, or "dial" a phone.  Ask a friend to go on a picnic with you, and pack a bag or a basket of treats, a picnic blanket, and maybe a good book or two. You can pack the whole picnic yourself, or ask your friend to bring one or two things (a beverage, a fruit) while you bring the rest.   Visit a farmer's market or a grocery store together and pick out 3-6 things together. You might get fresh bread, apples, cheese, chocolate, carrots, and hummus, for example. Take your picnic somewhere green and quiet, or somewhere with a good view. Go on a hike if you can. Eat the picnic at the top of the mountain or end of the trail. Make sure to pack water!	Go on a wander. Visit strange shops. Pack a picnic.
Your dealer will be able to inform you about the types of alarm systems that come standard on specific trucks. If you want to purchase an after-market alarm system, you should not hesitate because of extraneous issues, such as a fear of violating a manufacturer's warranty. Due to federal law, it is not legal to void a warranty due to the installation of an alarm system unless the manufacturer supplies the truck with an alarm for free.; , One of the best ways to get information on alarms is directly from the police. They deal with auto theft on a daily basis and can inform you of why certain alarms work for frequently than others.  There are several different types of alarms that work in their own unique ways. Independent alarms simply sound off a siren or horn when breached, while other more complex alarms interact with police to a great extent, even going so far as to give authorities GPS locations of the stolen vehicle.  Radar Sensors can create a field around your truck, detecting any movement around the entire vehicle and sound an alarm in the event of any unwarranted activities. Audio Sensor alarms detect specific frequencies of breaking glass and sound a horn or alarm when detected, which saves valuable items inside your truck in the event of a smash and grab.  Many alarm systems will have reviews on the internet. Make note of which companies have the most positive reviews, and which models of alarms have received the most praise.  This is a crucial aspect of owning an alarm. Do not install the alarm yourself unless you are a qualified professional with extensive experience working with alarms and the electrical system of your truck. If installed incorrectly, your alarm could malfunction, either sounding off when there is no present danger, or worse, failing to sound when needed.  Just as automotive insurance companies offer rate reductions for defensive driving courses, many offer reductions for the addition of an aftermarket alarm.	Discuss alarm installation with your dealership. Talk to law enforcement professionals. Decide which features are right for you. Consider external alarms. Research alarm companies. Purchase your alarm and have it installed professionally. Contact insurance company for possible rate reductions.
The cause will usually be either a badly out of balance load, or a poorly leveled and set up machine.   Balance the load of clothes by opening the lid, and looking to see if there is a lot more on one side of the agitator than the other, and if this is the problem, move them around, close the lid, restart the spin cycle, and observe the results. You may try repositioning the clothes in the tub slightly more if you original efforts helped significantly. If the machine is brand new and already started behaving this way from its first use, then it is possible that the shipping bolts were not removed from the back of the machine before first use. This would cause violent vibration during the spin cycle. You can check if this is the case easily by opening the door on a front-loader washing machine and pushing down on the drum. If the shipping bolts are still fixed to the machine, then the drum will not move vertically at all. If they have been removed by the person that installed it, as they should have been, then the drum should sink slightly under the pressure of your hand and then spring back up when released.; , If it wobbles when you do, the adjustment screws on the machine's base may not be set correctly, or on older machines, the threads may be stripped or corroded out, causing them to fail.  This is done by kneeling down in front of the machine, and rocking it to see which corner seems to be floating, or not in contact with the floor. The leveling screw should be screwed out (clockwise, if viewed from above), which lengthens it, or the adjacent side should be screwed in (shortened), so that each leveler is in contact with the floor. ,, Shims can be made of almost any resilient, non-degradable material which can be cut easily, like scrap vinyl composition tile, rubber matting, or even plastic margarine container lids. ,	Find out the reason for the shaking during the spin cycle. Try to tip or tilt the machine. Re-level your machine and ensure it is supported correctly. Use a pair of pliers if the thumbscrews are too tight to turn with your fingers, and spraying the screws with a lubricant may help, also.  , Restart your machine when you have made sure all the leveling screws are in contact with the floor.  , Use shims to support the machine if the screws have become unusable for some reason (broken, stripped, or otherwise damaged). Cut a number of shims, about 3 or 4 inches (7.6 or 10.2 cm) in width, and stack them under each corner where they are needed, until the corners are equally supported.  , Restart the machine and observe your results.
If making garments is your specialty, sew a few sample dresses or other garments to show to potential buyers. Let buyers know that the items are only samples and offer to sew garments based on the buyer's measurements.       Sew handbags or other accessories. Purses and bags are popular items at craft fairs and online shops, so think of a way to put your sewing skills to use to come up with a design that sets your bags apart.       For example, you might want to sew bags with LED lights sewn into the front. Another idea would be to make a purse that can fold up to fit in a pocket when not in use.; ,   You don't want to start an online shop or attend a craft fair and have only 1 or 2 items for sale. Make at least 20 hand-sewn items before you put your shop up online or register for craft fairs. Don't go overboard purchasing materials. You don't want to end up with massive amounts of unsold inventory if your home sewing business doesn't take off.    Before applying to any craft fair, look at the style of the fair and the type of items that vendors sell to determine whether your items will be a good fit. For example, if you sew traditional items, you may not fit in at a more trendy or contemporary craft fair. Some craft fairs want a wide range of items and may not accept you if you sew items that are common, such as purses or skirts. Scout out the craft fair while you're there to meet other artists and to see what other crafters are doing. Bring along a friend to watch your table while you walk around the craft fair.   The cost of traveling to craft fairs can add up. You'll also have to pay for the table or booth, as well as materials to display your hand-sewn items.    Register for an account at an online handmade listing site. You can do this in place of selling at craft fairs to make your sewing business truly a home business. List your items on the site and set prices for them. Set your prices so that you'll actually make money. Don't be shy about pricing items high. You've put a lot of work into sewing them, and you should make money beyond reimbursing yourself for materials.    Print fliers advertising your lessons and hang them at local fabric and craft stores. Advertise your lessons on a free online classified website.	Decide what items you will sew and sell. Create enough hand-sewn items to display to customers at craft fairs and online. Register and apply to sell items at craft fairs to make money. Stay local to start. Set up an online shop. Teach sewing lessons to children and adults to make money at home.
Make sure they think you're ready enough so that you don't crash and burn in front of 50+ people.; , There are many, many feisanna in the spring.  Usually these will be available somewhere in your dance studio. Make sure you have a copy of the official form, because some feisanna require that you submit an actual entry form and ignore index cards or paper. Better safe than sorry. On the flip side, some feisanna will ask that you use an index card. It will probably say, "Entries to be submitted on a 3x5 card." This means a standard index card. The information sheet will then give you a list of things to write down (i.e. 1. Name, 2. Age, and so on). Always number the card 1 through 10 and write each tidbit of information down next to the number designated on the form.   If you read about the feis online, there will usually be a link that takes you to the syllabus and entry form. Some schools will mail you your number if you enclose a self-addressed, stamped envelope big enough for however big of a card they say. This is optional, because all feiseanna will give you your number when you get there if you don't have it already. Sometimes schools will post the list of competitors and their numbers, schools, levels, etc. on their website once they have received all the entries. If such is the case, you can look, but don't write your number on your own index card, because the card they give you will also have other important information on it. This is, however, a great resource to use to see how many people you'll be up against. You can also check to see if your friends will be there. ,,, The syllabus is the sheet that says which category you belong in, what songs you dance to, and what dances you do.  if you have never competed before, you most likely fall into Beginner. Check with your teacher to be sure. For experienced competitors, check the syllabus and it will say where you belong. Read carefully above each table where it lists the category name, and then it should say, "For dancers who have won__________in________category or something similar.  This is whatever age you are under, or going to be. For example, if it's February, you're 11 years old and you turn 12 in the summer, and your feis is in April, you would list yourself as Beginner, U12.  Beginners typically do a reel and a light jig, and a slip jig is also a choice if they feel they're ready. Check with your teacher to see if s/he thinks you're ready for a slip jig. Find your U under your category (in the table on the left hand column it should say, "U12" and then three numbers). For a reel, light jig and slip jig, the numbers are usually in the 120's. Fill them in. So in the lines it might say, "Beginner U12, 121, 122, 123."  ,, This should be the head director of your school. The names of student or assistant teachers are NOT appropriate in this field and may be disregarded.  Most feisanna charge something like $8 per dance. For example, $8 times three dances = $24.  This is a fee for any parties who want to watch you dance. If you are dancing with no one in the audience with you (sometimes you're better off that way, because family only agitates you at a feis) you have no gate fee to pay. Instead of a gate fee, however, many feiseanna now ask that everyone pays a "basic fee," which is only once per family.  This is your total fee.  On the school's website, they will post lots of important information, so check for things like your competition number and which stage and time you're dancing on (there are like 4). It will include information about the venue (not driving directions though!), local restaurants and lodging and anything else they feel you should know about where you'll be dancing. Some studios mail out the competitor numbers to the school you dance at, and you find the index card with your name on the back. On the front is your number.	Get your teacher's approval. Find a feis you want to compete in. Find the entry form. Fill out general information, such as your name, street address, phone number and e-mail address, and anything else it may ask you for.  , Fill in your age as of January 1st of the current year.  , Fill in your date of birth, and the age you currently are.  , Find the syllabus (SILL-a-bus), and fill the rest in with it handy. Fill in your category. Fill in your U, which is right after your category name. Decide what dances you will do. Write down your school name.  , Write down your teacher's name. Figure out how much you owe. Include the gate fee. Add these two fees together. Mail this form to the organization or Irish dance school holding the feis. Make sure you know where you're going.
Putty sealers typically get molded around the base of the mold to seal the hole. They’re usually pressed into a disk and stuck to the bottom of the mold. Removing this kind of sealer is as simple as peeling it off, much like sticky tack., Magnetic mold sealers are simple metal sheets that are magnetically charged. They snap onto the bottom of a mold to prevent wax from leaking out. Removing these is as simple as pulling them off.  If you’re using plastic or aluminium molds, you’re likely not using a magnetic mold sealer., Rubber mold plugs are shaped somewhat like a spinning top; they have a large base and a tapered tip. Usually they just squeeze into the hole at the bottom of a candle mold. That means removing them is as simple as grabbing the base and pulling them out.  With rubber molds, the wick may be wrapped around a wick bar at the bottom of the mold. If so, you’ll need to unwrap the wick before you can remove the candle., If you try to remove the candle before the wax has set completely, the surface of the candle might tear and crumble. Leave the mold on a flat surface that won’t be damaged while the mold is still warm. It may take some time for the mold to cool; be patient., Flip the mold upside down, so the opening faces downwards. Use your fingers to lightly tap on the bottom of the mold, which will shake the candle loose. Tap slowly and progressively, or the candle might slip out too quickly.  Don’t bang the mold against a counter or other hard surface, since this could damage the candle., If tapping on the mold isn’t enough to dislodge the candle, you can gently tug on the couple of inches of wick poking out the top of the candle. Don’t use too much strength when pulling on the wick; you might break the string or cause it to slip out of the candle., Placing the mold in the refrigerator will speed up the cooling process, helping the wax set and separate from the mold. Flip the mold every 30 minutes; this will make sure the mold and wax cool evenly. Check the mold periodically; you’ll want to remove it from the fridge as soon as it’s cold to the touch.  Make sure you wait until the mold has cooled to room temperature before placing it in the fridge. If the temperature change is too drastic, the candle could crack., If the candle’s especially difficult to dislodge, you can try putting the mold in the freezer. Take it out after five minutes and try to remove the candle. If it still won’t budge, leave it in the freezer for an additional five minutes. You don’t want to leave the mold in any longer than 10 minutes, since this will definitely cause the candle to crack., Finally, if you’ve tried all of the above and can’t remove the candle, you might have to cut your losses. Place the mold in a metal dish filled with boiling water and wait for the candle to soften. After a few minutes, you should be able to retrieve the candle; use a pair of tongs or a wooden spoon to avoid burning yourself.  This process won’t save your candle, but you can at least melt down the wax for use in your next attempt.	Peel off putty type sealers. Snap off magnetic mold sealers. Pull out rubber mold plugs. Wait until the mold cools completely. Tap on the bottom of the mold. Tug the wick lightly. Refrigerate the mold. Put the mold in the freezer for five minutes. Use boiling water to remove completely stuck candles.
Get an 18-inch (45.72-centimeter) long sheet of felt. Fold it in half so that it is 14 inches (35.56 centimeters) long. This method is for a wine bag, but you can use it to make another type of bag as well. Simply change the dimensions to suit your gift.How wide the felt is depends on how many bags you want to make. The wider the felt, the more bags you'll be able to make.  Keep the narrower edge on the fold. If you'd like to, you can cut it out using pinking sheers for an interesting effect.You can also round the top corners instead., Unfold your felt strip. Measure down about 4 inches (10.16 centimeters) from one of the narrow edges. Make two vertical slits in the middle, about ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) apart, and ½ to 1 inch (1.27 to 2.54 centimeters) tall.The slits need to be the same height as your ribbon. If the ribbon you will be using is a different height, adjust the height of the slits accordingly.  Start applying the glue about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) from the bottom. This will create the base of the bag.Apply the glue no more than 1/4 inch (.64 centimeters) from the edges., Choose a ½ to 1-inch (1.27 to 2.54-centimeter) wide ribbon that matches your bag. Slide the ribbon under the back tab. Wrap it around to the front. Insert your gift, then tie the ends of the ribbon into a bow.For a nicer touch, cut the ends of the ribbon at an angle.	Fold a sheet of felt fabric in half. Cut a 6 by 18-inch (15.24 by 45.72-centimeter) rectangle out of the felt. Cut two slits into the back of the bag for the ribbon closure. Hot glue the long edges of the bag together. Add a ribbon.

To use Pandora, you can listen without an account, but it won't store any of your music the next time you visit it, so it's helpful to create an account so you can save stations.   With Pandora you can also choose between a free account and a paid account. The paid account essentially allows you to listen to music without commercials or advertisements.  One way to discover new music on Pandora is by creating new stations and liking or disliking certain songs as they play. You can create a station based on an artist or track, and then Pandora will play music similar to that artist or track.  As you listen to music, the best way to discover new music is by personalizing your station. When a song comes on that you like, click the "thumbs-up" icon at the top of the screen and when you dislike a song click the "thumbs-down" icon. This will help Pandora play songs that are more suited to your taste.   Each time a new song plays, Pandora will also show similar artists to that song. As you are listening to music, you may discover some new artists or songs by clicking on one of those similar artists. After you have listened to a station you can also go back to that station and edit the artists and tracks you have liked or disliked. On the left side of the screen where your stations are displayed, you can click on the "Options" button underneath a station. Then click on "Station Details," and you'll be brought to a page that shows your thumbed-up and thumbed-down tracks. If you are tired of certain songs or want more variety you can delete some of those tracks so that the variety of music played on that station will be broader.  In Pandora you can also browse playlists and genres that Pandora has already created. In the top left corner, click in the search bar. A white box that gives you instructions should come up as well as a link within that box that says "Browse Genres." Click on that link to view the different genres and stations.   Pandora has a number of stations within each genre, suited for the type of music you are interested in or the mood your are feeling. You can view their top stations, for music that is popular, or you can visit their other categories that consist of a number of genres with different stations within the genres. There are certain categories that aren't necessarily a genre like "Classical," but are more of a mood, like "Dinner/Cooking," "Studying," and "Workout." Within these categories you have different stations that Pandora has created. For example, within "Dinner/Cooking" there are different stations like "Hipster Cocktail Party," "Laid Back Brunch," Funny Feast Comedy," all with songs that are suited for that type of meal.	Create an account. Create new stations based on an artist or song. Personalize your station. Browse genres.
A typical dining room has fewer pieces of decor because the surfaces of the furniture need to remain empty for meals. The walls offer the best opportunity for adding a splash of style with photographs, paintings, prints, or shelves.Look for pieces that fit the style you chose for the space. Consider how the pieces will look together.  A large mirror can reflect the light in the room, making the room feel brighter. Look for a mirror that has a frame that fits the style you want. You can even find a dramatic frame that turns the mirror into a focal point in the room., Choosing a wall cover can change the whole look of the room. Consider painting it a fun color, or apply a wallpaper. You can decide to do the whole room, or you can limit the print to one wall.   Get samples of paint colors and wallpapers to see how they look in your room before you invest in your choice.  Make one wall a focal point by setting it apart from the rest. You can use a special paint color or wallpaper, or you can use groupings of paintings or prints. Arrange items according to a central theme.   If you collect items, consider grouping your collections on shelves to create an accent wall.	Choose art that expresses your style. Try a large mirror. Add color or a wallpaper print. Create an accent or gallery wall.
The vegetables should be arranged loosely in a single layer and should not overlap.  Wait until the vegetables are firm before removing the tray.  You must leave an appropriate amount of empty space to allow the food a chance to expand as it freezes. Otherwise, you risk breaking the container.   For container freezing, leave a 1/2-inch (1.27-centimeter) space between the top of the top of the vegetables and the rim of the container. When freezing in a plastic bag, leave a 3-inch (7.62-centimeter) space between the top of the vegetables and the top of the bag. Seal the bag and tie it shut with a rubber band placed 1/2-inch (1.27-centimeter) above the top of the food. Some garden vegetables, like green beans, beets, cabbage, carrots, onions, peas, peppers, and turnips, do not need to be tray frozen before being packed. For these vegetables, tightly pack the blanched, drained vegetables into containers and follow the same guidelines regarding empty space.  Write down the contents of the package and the date the food was first frozen.  For best results, only pack 2 to 3 pounds (900 to 1350 grams) of vegetables for each cubic foot. If the vegetables are packed any tighter than that, they may take too long to freeze.  The majority of garden vegetables will retain their freshness, taste, and nutritional value for a year or longer if kept at this temperature.	Lay blanched, drained vegetable pieces flat on a shallow tray. Place the tray in the freezer. Fill freezer bags or freezer containers with the frozen vegetables. Label each bag or container with a felt tip marker. Place the sealed, labeled packages into a freezer. Keep the temperature of your freezer set at 0 degrees Fahrenheit (-18 degrees Celsius).
This makes one less side that can be accessed to tow your vehicle.; , This makes it nearly impossible to tow your vehicle from the back end unless it is put on a flat bed tow truck. In this case, it will at least make it more difficult to get onto the bed of the tow truck.  While this doesn't keep your vehicle from being towed, it will make it more difficult. , By enabling the 4-wheel-drive system (automatic 4-wheel-drive doesn't count, you have to select a full-time mode), the drivetrain is all locked together, and requires all four wheels to move together. By selecting 4-LO, the low gearing will undoubtedly hold the vehicle where you parked it. Don't forget to disable 4WD when you decide to leave, otherwise damage may occur to the drivetrain when operating 4WD on pavement.  This makes it almost impossible for your vehicle to be towed.	Park against a full curb in back or front of the vehicle, if possible. Turn your wheels to the side as much as possible. Set your parking or emergency brake as hard as you can. Utilize the 'club' or some steering wheel locking device.  , If you have a 4-Wheel-Drive system on your vehicle, select the 4-HI setting, or if you really want to take the extra time and make it as absolutely difficult as possible, enable the 4-LO mode. You can also park between two cars, one in front of you and one in back of you.You can use wheel lock to make it immobilized.
Planting stem cuttings is one of the most popular ways to propagate roses. The best time to take and plant cuttings is when the temperature outside is warm but not too hot. The ideal time of year for this is late spring or early summer.   It is possible to grow roses from cuttings when the weather is colder, but the process will take longer and your chances of success will be lower.If you don’t have a rose bush of your own that you can use for a cutting, ask a friend or neighbour if they have a plant you can use. You may also be able to find wild rose bushes that you can propagate. You can also ask a local nursery or garden center if they let people take cuttings from any of their plants.; , To propagate roses using this method, you need to select a healthy rose plant and cut off a stem. For this project, you will need some gardening, cutting, and potting tools, including:   Clean two-inch (five-cm) pot Potting soil Sharp sterilized cutting tool Rooting hormone Clear plastic bag or mason jar  , Fill the small pot with potting soil. For the best results, replace a quarter of the soil with perlite, peat moss, or vermiculite, or a combination thereof. This will increase air flow and draining, giving your cutting a better opportunity to root.If the soil is dry, water it and allow the excess water to drain out, so that the soil is evenly moist.   Instead of a pot, you can also use a small mason jar or the bottom half of a large plastic bottle (cut the top off).  Choose a healthy and established plant to take a cutting from. The stem should come from the top and side of the plant, and it should have at least three leaves on it. Ideally, find a stem that has flowered recently. Look for a stem that’s young but established and hardy, and that’s about six inches (15 cm) long.   It’s better to take cuttings from the top and side of the plant because they seem to root better than cuttings from the middle or bottom.It’s ok if the stem you select has buds and flowers currently on it, but look for a stem with flowers that are starting to wither. This indicates the stem recently bloomed.  The best tool for taking the cutting is a pair of sharp pruning sheers or a razor blade. Cut the stem from the plant at a 45-degree angle, just below one of the lower leaf nodes (where the leaf attaches to the stem).Make sure the cutting tool has been sterilized to prevent the spread of disease. To sterilize your cutting tool, you can heat it with fire until it’s red hot, or boil it in water for 30 minutes.  With the same cutting tool, cut off any withered flowers and new buds where they attach to the stem. If any hips (fruit) have started to form, cut these off as well.Cut off any leaves on the lower half of the stem. Leave two to three higher leaves to help with photosynthesis.  Wounding is the process of making slits in the bottom of the stem, and this will encourage rooting. With the same cutting tool, cut one-inch (2.5-cm) slits in the bark at the bottom of the stem.   Make three or four slits in the bark to give the roots more places to grow out from., Insert the bottom two inches (five cm) of the cutting so that the cutting, wounds, and bottom of the stem are covered in the hormone.Rooting hormone is not a necessary step in the cutting and propagating process, but it will increase the chances that your cutting will grow successfully.  With the tip of your finger or a pencil, make a two-inch (five-cm) hole in the potting soil at the center of the pot. Place the cut end of the stem in the hole. Pack the soil around the stem and use your hands to firm the soil in place.   Water the soil so that it’s thoroughly moist., To cover the stem with plastic, insert two eight-inch (20-cm) sticks or wires into the soil on either side of the stem to prop up the plastic. Cover the pot and stem with a clear plastic bag, and affix the bag to the pot with an elastic or twine. With a mason jar, simply place a large mason jar over the stem.   Covering the stem with glass or plastic will create a miniature greenhouse, and the cover will help keep in the heat, moisture, and ultraviolet rays the stem needs to root and grow., Throughout each day, the plant will need plenty of bright sunlight. But to avoid overheating, place the plant in a bright location that receives lots of indirect sunlight, especially around midday.The mason jar or plastic will help to keep the soil and cutting moist, but add more water any time the cutting or soil starts to dry out.	Select the right time. Gather your tools. Prepare a pot. Select a stem for the cutting. Cut off a section of stem. Remove flowers, buds, and some leaves. Wound the cutting. Dip the cutting in rooting hormone. Plant and water the cutting. Cover the stem with plastic or a mason jar. Provide the cutting with plenty of sunlight and moisture as it grows.
It is very challenging to learn this piece without the audio aid.; , The steps in this article are based on that tab. Understand that the measures are divided by a dotted line, not a solid line. I assume that this is because, for the first half of the piece, Eddie doesn't really follow any definable time signature. There are some parts of this tab which are a bit off, due to the extreme speed of his playing. A friend of mine and I know this to be true, because we used a program named "Sony Acid Pro" to slow it down to half speed, where we could listen to and distinguish every note being played.  This is the tuning he uses, and it really does help the speed, because the strings are looser.  This is not optional.    In measure 1, ignore what they say, and start with a slide down from fret 7 on the A string. Measure 2 is authentic, but you can ignore the palm mutes if you want. If you don't want to, palm mute LIGHTLY. Measure 3 is a bit more challenging. Up to the point where you play fret 5 on both b and high-e strings, it is authentic. After that, the publishers made a mistake. Each sequence of -8-5-0- on the b string followed by -8- on the g string followed by open e string is actually -8-5-0- followed by -8- on the b string the first time through, only you leave the open e string out, and hold the -8- on the g string for emphasis. After that, it is actually -5-8-5-0-, with no g or e string at all. (Note the different sequence on the b string. This is the correct way to play it.) The exact same rule applies to the beginning of measure 4, where the sequence is repeated one more time. Measure 4 is literally almost half wrong. After the already corrected sequence, he doesn't play -7- on g, -5- on b, and then -5- on e. He actually plays open d, -7- on g, and -5- on b. He doesn't play the following -8-5- pull-off on b, the -7- 1/2 bend on g, or the -5- on b, so skip 'em. From then until the end of measure 4 is correct. Measure 5 is correct up until the slide from -3- to -15- on the (a) string. But this is easy to correct...simply play the -3- and leave out the slide. Note the dive-bomb with the whammy bar on open e. Do not play the little -15- (on a) to open-a pull-off. It is incorrect. When you play the chord progression in measures 6 and 7, have fun with it. This is usually where he does the scissors 4 feet (1.2 m) in the air, so play it nice and slowly with a lot of emphasis. At the end of measure 7, the slide is not from -3- to natural harmonic at -19- on the b string. It is actually from -2- to natural harmonic at -19- on the g string. In measure 8, do not bend the last -20- (on b) of the -20- (on b) to -17- (on e) sequence. Leave out the -20- that comes right after you play the open g. In measure 9, do not bend the second -19- (on b) 1 1/2. Instead, bend the -20- (on b) one full bend. Also, when you have just finished the full -20- (on e) bend, and you have pulled off to -17- (on e) do not play the -17- (on e) after you have played the -20- (on b). Just go into the next sequence. In measure 10, do not play the whammy bar from -20- on b. Move on to the slide. Until measure 18, the tabs are correct. Polish your picking skills. You will be picking very, very quickly from measure 12 to measure 17. Measures 18 and 19 have some faults. Ignore the -7- to -8- slide on the d string, and, right after that, instead of what they say, play -5-0-4- (on g) followed by -6-0-5- (on b) followed by -7-0-5- (on g) followed by -8-0-7-5- on (on b) first bending and then trilling the last -5-. At the end of measure 19, leave out the open d string, and slide from open e to -7- on e instead of -5- to -7-. Measures 20 and 21 make up the exact same tune of measures 18 and 19, only transposed. Instead of playing the -7- (on a) after you do the second -5-0- pull-off (on d) hammer on a -4- (on d) and then play -5-0-4- (on g) followed by -7-0-5- (on d) followed by -7-0-6-4- (on g) and trill the last -4- half a step. At the end of measure 21, through measure 22, repeat the same sequence that you played in measures 18 and 19, and it's easier to transpose the -11-9-11-9-and so on (on g) in measures 22 and 23 up to the b string, where you would start with -7-5-7-5-. Measure 24 through measure 39 is totally two hand tapping. Eddie actually plays it on the b string, not the g string, so if you transpose (which is advisable since it's actually easier the way he does it) then you would start with -14-2-5- (b string) and then go into -9-2-5- (also b string). In measures 31, 32, and 33 where he starts his decent, the (transposed to b string) the notes are actually -17-12-15--17-11-14--17-11-14--17-10-13--17-9-12--17-9-12--17-12-15- -12-15--17-11-14--17-11-14--17-10-13--17-10-13--17-9-12--17-9-12- and so on.

In particular, you will want to gather as much information as you can about your vehicle's specific wiring colors, the locations of those wires, and the wires' polarities. Knowing these things beforehand can save you a lot of time and frustration mid-installation.; , You will need to know how your specific car alarm interfaces with your SUV. Plan out the installation locations and wiring routes beforehand in order to save time later.  In particular, make sure that your doors trigger the "door ajar" light on the dashboard when they are open. In the case that a door does not trigger the light, there is a good chance that the door won't trigger the car alarm. , Once you have a suitable location, mount it securely according to the instructions specific to your car alarm. You can find those instructions in the car alarm's manual.  Try to install the car alarm in a hidden place.  All of these alarm component wiring instructions should be included in your car alarm manual. Make sure you pay attention to where the wires should be cut or altered.   It is strongly recommended that you test wire polarities before making connections. , The car alarm manual should explain how to do this, but the wiring can grow tricky at this step. If further assistance is needed, it is recommended that you contact a technical advisor. , If you encounter any problems with the alarm, troubleshoot them as soon as possible.	Gather information regarding your SUV's paneling and wiring. Study your vehicle design alongside your car alarm's installation manual. Check your SUV for any problems before beginning installation. Remove the necessary panels in your vehicle depending on the vehicle model and your car alarm model.  , Look under the hood of your SUV and choose a location for the placement of your car alarm's siren. Look around the interior of your SUV and locate a suitable mount area for your car alarm near the dashboard. Wire the valet switch, LED light, and external antenna that come with the alarm. Connect the car alarm power wire directly to the vehicle's battery under the hood.  , Install the car alarm's shock detector and door lock mechanisms. Replace the panels in your SUV.  , Walk through your car alarm's testing instructions in the manual.
Only prune your orchid once the flowers wither and die. The spike attached to the blooms should begin to yellow, as well.  You should see the vertical spike emerging from a wide, green section of plant material, known as the bud sheath. When you shine a light at the back of this sheath, you should be able to see the lower part of the spike.   Note that a bud sheath will either be green or papery brown. Color is not necessarily an indication of sheath health, though. The bud sheath protects immature buds as they bloom and will not die off even when the flowers and spike are dying. Make sure that the sheath is an old one. Ideally, you should see flowers or spikes visible. If you cannot see any from the top of the sheath, squeeze the sheath gently to make sure that there are no fresh, healthy buds inside.  Trace the sheath down the stem, toward the pseudobulb. The sheath and its spike originate at the top of this pseudobulb, usually protected by one or two leaves.   Note that the pseudobulb is a portion of the stem that emerges directly above the ground. It is wider than the rest of the stem and looks somewhat bulb-shaped.  Hold the upper part of the sheath and spike steady with your non-dominant hand. Use a sharp cutting tool to cut through both the sheath and the spike, positioning the cut as close to the base of the protective leaves as possible.   Do not cut through the leaves or the pseudobulb.	Wait for the flowers to fade. Find the old bud sheath. Locate the point at which the bud sheath meets the stem. Cut through the sheath and the spike.
Just like with a small child, it is important to mark out your tree's growth during the first 2 years of its life in order to determine its adult form.   After permanently planting your olive tree, the first pruning should be done in summer. Using pruning shears, get rid of all secondary shoots less than 30 inches (76.2 cm) in length.; , To do this, you should tie the main trunk in order to keep secondary shoots from growing.   Starting at the base, wrap a gardening rope or a normal rope around the olive tree's trunk until you reach a height of 40 inches (101.6 cm). The ties should be firm, but not too tight, because this could strangulate the trunk and cause the upper branches to dry out. To keep this from happening, change the rope out for a new one regularly.  During the first year and a half, it is highly probably that secondary shoots will continue to appear, despite having correctly pruned the tree.   Check weekly for the growth of new secondary shoots. If you happen to find one, cut it off with pruning shears while it is still green or it will become more difficult to remove it and multiple new shoots will appear around that spot in the following weeks.	Orient your olive tree's growth. Assure that your tree grows correctly. Frequently check the secondary shoots.
Pretend they're not there. Just act as if you cannot see them, hear them or feel their presence. Act as if they aren't about at all.; , If you are bugged by a decision they've made or something they've said, go overboard in the upset stakes. Show them you're upset and if they ask you to do something hang your head low and say you've got plans or quickly run to the toilet. This will make them worried about you, making sure that you don't get the blame for what happens tomorrow.  Don't just sing, sing horribly, kind of like a walrus dying of suffocation. Aka, really bad. Also, make it a really annoying song.  Self explanatory.  For example, "How does the reproductive system of a duck work?" Say it over and over again.  Say something really sweet, and then put JK or LOL or ROFL at the end of it.  Whoopee cushions are outdated. Here are better pranks. Use a pinprick to make some tiny holes in a drink straw. Or, wait for a rainy day and make paper confetti, put it in an umbrella and then watch when someone opens it.   Plenty more pranks can be found in wikiHow's pranking category.  Ask a simple question and when they answer, just ask "Why?" after every answer.  When they look over at you, hide behind your hands. As if by hiding your face in your hands, they won't see you. Then repeat.  For example, "Hey , hey , hey , hey , guess what? I'm bored!" It works like a charm.  This is perfect if you have patience. If they say a word that's really long and you can't quite remember, just say "blah". Works every time.   While mimicking, use a really annoying voice. It could be anything from squeaky and high-pitched to a simple accent.  Not nice comments, either; comments that come across as cynical, disbelieving and deflating are the best. This works well while talking in a small group.  If your teacher says, "Clean up your desk!" to your friend, whisper, "Yeah , clean up your desk!" Make sure the teacher can't hear you.	Ignore them. Overdo the sorrow. Sing. Make a really annoying noise. Say something really dumb. Pretend to be really, really deep. Prank them. Try the "why" game. Poke the person constantly. Repeat something over and over again. Mimic them. Comment on everything they say. Just repeat every instruction they are given.
A warm, sunny, southern or western exposure is best. Shelter is a big help, too, if cold is a concern. Choose or create someplace with well-drained soil, and avoid putting a citrus tree directly into a lawn. A nearby reflective wall, fence, or even patio can provide both shelter and a bit of extra warmth, too.       ; ,  Choose the type of citrus you would like to try growing (oranges, lemons, grapefruit, etc.).              Ask the nursery about the climate that the particular tree is suitable for.              Ask about or look up the season for the tree(s) you intend to get. Citrus generally ripens in winter, but different fruits ripen throughout the year, as well. If you live somewhere that's a bit colder than a strictly Mediterranean climate, look into cultivars bred for cold resistance. Taste the fruit, if you have the opportunity. Not all oranges are alike. If you can taste fruit grown on a tree in your area, perhaps from a neighbor, even better.              Find out if the fruit produced has many seeds, or not.              Ask for certification of the health of the tree, or ask someone who's experienced with citrus trees to inspect it. See Warnings.  Ask at the nursery or look up online how large the mature tree will get.          Try dwarf citrus trees if you are short on space. You can even grow them in large pots, and they open up the possibility of covering the entire tree in a shelter during the delicate winter months or even bringing the tree indoors. Even though they are small, dwarf citrus trees can produce a very reasonable harvest. On the other end of the spectrum, a couple of large lemon trees can form a good-sized hedgerow. It all depends on just how much citrus you want.  The saying goes that you should dig at least a $60 hole for a $20 tree. As a practical matter, make sure you know where you want to place the tree, then dig a hole that is about three feet (1 meter) in diameter and as deep as the container. Do not bury the root crown, the transition from trunk to roots, as this will cause problems down the road. Plant the tree slightly higher than the surrounding soil to allow for some settling, most container grown nursery stock has high organic matter content that will decompose causing the plant to settle in the planting hole dropping the root crown below grade if not planted slightly high.          If you have any concerns about drainage, such as in heavy clay soil, fill the hole with water and see how long it takes to drain out. If you have drainage problems (that is, if the water is not gone by the next morning), dig the hole even deeper and plant the tree up higher.              For a dwarf citrus tree, select a large pot. Try for two feet in diameter or a half-barrel, at least.  Depending on the quality of what you took out of the hole, you might try a half-and-half mixture of compost and the now-loosened soil. Create a mound of soil in the middle of the hole that supports the root ball with the crown (the base of the tree trunk where the roots begin) slightly above it.  Mix in some citrus fertilizer with the soil, if you like.              If you are planting a dwarf citrus in a pot, use straight potting soil and fill it in to a similar level. Place the pot up on blocks and be sure there are plenty of drainage holes in the bottom. Don't let the pot sit directly in a saucer or puddle of water.  Place the tree on the mound of soil. Add or remove soil underneath to adjust the height so that the crown is level with the soil or even slightly above it.           If you are using a pot, fill with straight potting soil. Leave at least two inches at the top to allow space to water thoroughly.           Stay away from organic mulch, as it increases the likelihood of foot rot disease. A safe bet is that the roots are at least as wide as the branches, so make the mulch area at least this large. You can even add a rim of mulch around the circumference of the circle to aid in watering. Do not mulch right up to the base of the trunk. Leave a little margin so that the crown has breathing room and doesn't stay wet when you water.  Water even mature citrus trees regularly. Citrus trees have relatively shallow, broad root systems. Once established, the trees may tolerate some drought, but they won't produce fruit that's as good.  Fertilizers are available in citrus or citrus-and-avocado formulations. Apply them according to package instructions, typically three to four times a year for slow-release types.  They don't require heavy or regular pruning.  Remove any "suckers", or shoots growing from the rootstock. Citrus trees are grafted, meaning that a tree with desirable fruit is cut and attached to a sturdier rootstock. You don't want the rootstock taking over.              Remove any "wild" shoots growing beyond the general shape of the tree. These will often be long, straight, quick-growing branches that don't follow the overall form or shape of the tree.              Moderately thin the foliage if it grows excessively dense, to promote air circulation and availability of light. Generally, train citrus trees as shrubs or hedges. If you'd like to remove a few lower branches to give it more of a tree shape, go ahead, but don't overdo it.  Oranges, lemons, and grapefruit should all be completely free of green coloring. They will not ripen off the tree. Limes are generally picked green, so go by size and season. See the external links for more details on limes.	Choose a location for your tree. Select and obtain a tree. Choose a size of tree that is appropriate for your setting. Dig a large hole. Partially refill the hole with good, well-draining soil. Remove the tree from its pot and remove any burlap around the roots. Fill in the remaining hole with a mixture of compost or potting soil and the soil from your garden. Do not apply mulch. Water the tree at least weekly until it is established, unless you get sufficient rain to do the job. Fertilize the tree with an appropriate fertilizer. Prune citrus trees occasionally. Harvest fruit when it is fully ripe.
Playing this song will be different based on what instruments the musicians are using. In many variations of "Mad World" the major instrument is the piano. However, for other musical presentations, the guitar is the lead instrument. Think about which instruments are best for a specific rendition of this song.; , Sheet music for the song shows the intro as being composed of two chords: F minor and B flat major. Playing these two alternately will provide the back-and-forth kind of sound featured in the introduction to "Mad World."  , When the song is played with F minor as the base chord, the verse chord progression would be from F minor to A flat, E flat and B flat and back to F minor.   Think about alternatives for the key of the song. Changing the key can make the song sound a bit different. For instance, some versions of sheet music for "Mad World" use the chords E minor and A major for the intro. Being able to change keys for a song quickly is part of what makes a musician more experienced and professional, and it's worth putting some time into the study of relative chord progressions in order to be able to effectively change keys.  For example, if using the introduction chords F minor and B flat major, return to this same chord alternation for the chorus.   Listen to the way the alternating chords match the vocal chorus line: "I find it kind of funny, I find it kind of sad ..." Here, the timely resolution back to F minor is part of what makes the song feel a certain way. Getting this feeling right is part of playing this song well.  The pace of the chords is very important for "Mad World." Again, listen to the lyrics and try to make the pace of musical play match the vocals and the overall ethos of the song. Getting the sound right will evoke associations with the original version and make your version sound good.	Choose instrumentation. Utilize the common chord progression for the introduction. Use a different chord progression for the verse. Go back to the original chord progression for the chorus. Work on tempo.
A brown paper bag with crinkling is ideal for creating a weathered or parched look for your ancient explorer's map.; , If you are trying to make the map look tattered and worn, distressed edging would be best, with a few holes, gashes and tears here and there. Perhaps considering burning the edges in the way of the treasure maps. Or, you could cut it nice and straight into a rectangle or square, common map shapes. Consider how the map will end up being mounted as you make the shape too–the framing or board for mounting might determine some of the sizing.  Work out the key places in the world or area that they visited, as well as some important features of their exploration.  It is important to try to make the map as they would have know it in their time, most certainly this will not be a modern day map. Look online or visit the library to find old maps. Map shop staff might be able to help you out with older map versions if you're having trouble finding them.  This line should represent the voyage that the explorers have taken, from start to finish. Along this line, place stars, or some other clear symbol, to highlight points of great interest in the exploration.  Write down the names of the areas, and add any facts in speech bubbles or similar externally stuck on notes. Use arrows if needed to make it clear. Alternately, you might like to use pictorial representations of what the explorers discovered, such as pictures of fur, coal, gold, local people, pastures, housing etc. Look online for good photos and print off high quality versions. Photoshop anything that needs to be made to fit or to stand out in a certain way etc.  Add your signature or a mock explorer's signature if wished. If you are using the map for promotional purposes, add any extra details to promote your business, product, hobby, display, etc.  Once you are satisfied with its contents, frame or mount it as you wish.	Use a paper bag. Cut it into a shape that suits your needs. Do some research the explorer's voyage you are doing. Draw the world map or a zoomed map near the area where the explorer traveled on the map. Draw a colored line on the voyage on the map. Add details to the starred areas. Sign it off. Frame or mount the map.
This is the best time to water your garden because it works with the plants' natural growth cycle. The plants are ready to drink early in the morning, when the sun is up but not quite high in the sky. During the rest of the day, they'll be able to drink in the water before the sun gets hot. Hydrated plants are better able to withstand extreme heat.If you wait until noon or later, when the sun is very hot, the water can actually burn the plants. The sun-heated water will get too hot for the fragile stems and leaves, and it will leave damage in its wake. Try to water your garden before 10 am, to make sure the water has plenty of time to seep into the soil and dry a little before the sun gets strong. Watering in the afternoon wastes your water, since more of it will evaporate before soaking into the soil.; , It's not always convenient to water first thing in the morning when you have a million other things to do. If you miss the morning watering, wait until late afternoon, when the sun is no longer at its hottest. This way your plants won't get burned, and there will still be time for them to dry out a little before nightfall.If you wait until the afternoon, aim to water from 4 pm on, since before that time the sun may still be strong enough to burn your plants. If you absolutely must water when the sun is strong, try to do so only occasionally, rather than making it an everyday habit.  When you water at night, the water sits on the leaves and stems of the plants instead of evaporating. The soil may become water-logged instead of draining properly with help from the sun. This is detrimental to your plants because it leads to mold and fungal growth around the roots and on the stems and leaves.   Only water at night as a very last resort, if your plants are very thirsty and you can't wait until morning. If you must water at night, water the soil to avoid getting the plant itself wet, and use less water to avoid waterlogging. Irrigation tape or a soaker hose makes this much easier.  The general rule for gardens is that they need about one inch of water per week. However, certain types of plants need more water than this, and certain types need less. The best approach is to research your plants' water requirements, and to keep an eye on their health.If a plant wilts, it needs more water.   Another good test is to insert your finger a few inches into the soil. If it feels completely dry, it's probably time to water. If it's wet just below the surface, give it more time. Use common sense when it comes to the frequency with which you water your plants. For example, if it has been a rainy week, your plants don't need as much water. If you're in a drought, they might need extra water.  The roots absorb water that nourishes the plant; water that hits the leaves just drips off or evaporates. When you're watering, point the hose, watering can or sprinkler low on the plant, near the roots, to make sure the plant gets adequately watered there.   Watering over the plant and getting the leaves all wet is also detrimental to the plant's health. Water that sits on the leaves can either cause mold to form or cause the plant to overheat. If you find it difficult to water the roots using your hose, look into a special watering system that waters plants close to the ground, such as a soaker hose or a drip-tape irrigation system.  Most plants are healthiest when their roots grow deep into the ground, rather than growing outward and closer to the surface. Watering deeply, so that you completely saturate the soil, ensures that water gets all the way to the tips of the roots, and it encourages downward root growth.   That's why it's healthiest to water plants sparingly, but deeply. Instead of watering just a little bit every day, choose one or two days a week to give the plants a good, deep watering. That means spending a full thirty seconds or more on each area, rather than just spraying the garden down quickly.  Plants that are getting too much water are just as likely to die as plants that get too little water. Make sure you're watering your plants at the correct frequency, and try not to overdo it. Look for these signs that your garden might be getting too much water:   Leaves that are yellow or brownish at the tips Limp, soggy foliage Signs of rot	Water in the morning if possible. Water in the late afternoon if the morning is inconvenient. Do not water your garden at night. Water your garden with the correct frequency. Water near the roots, not over the leaves. Water long and deep. Check for signs of overwatering.
To be a medicine cat you will need knowledge on herbs and how they work. You will also need a pretty strong connection with Starclan.; , Stick to the warrior code, and make up prophecies to tell to friends and have people fulfill.  You have to know ALL of them, even the poisons that can kill you and the ones not used for cats or not generally used frequently. The main herbs are feverfew, for fever; marigold, for infection; poppy seeds for pain; catmint, for greencough; tansy, for coughs; and cobwebs, for bleeding. ,, Be sure you don't lose them. Stow them in a box outside. When you are out in the yard and it's not raining, open it to let the air come in.  You can still hang out with friends though, because even medicine cats have fun once in a while.  Be as busy as you can, and rush around the house often searching for a "certain herb that looks like parsley."  , You have to do lots of things being a medicine cat, and those are supposed to take up the bored time you have and make your life busier.  Being a medicine cat, you will have to set a time each month, if possible at night, to go to a certain pond, maybe lake, or a puddle, and if you aren't able to do that, a set place. Another idea is to make a Moonstone, which would be easier to find.  Find someone interested in herbs, and let them be trained by you. ,, You can use catspeak, but don't fight or seem a bit too close to it, because medicine cats never fight unless they have to (which means only if they are fighting a badger or fox).	Read up. Have a strong connection with Starclan. Know your herbs very well. When someone gets sick, suggest using an appropriate herbs, if none, then just go the normal way.  , Never mess up your herbs, and always fuss around with herbs.  , Go outside and search for certain herbs when you have spare time. Almost always be in your "den," either tending to sick cats or fussing around with herbs. Don't forget your duties. Never be bored!, Make sure you have time to go to the Moonpool!, Train your very own apprentice!, Last but not least, have fun being an herb obsessed medicine cat with everything you will need!  , Share medicine cat tips with medicine cats from other Clans, since medicine cats from each Clan are usually not rivals and are mostly friendly.  , Don't act like a warrior. Although hunting is typically a warrior duty, you are allowed to hunt once in a while to take a break from your medicine duties.
Acting, despite the term, is not simply acting like someone else... it is practically being someone else!; , You need to know your character up and down. You must know him/her/it better than you know your best friend: his traits, his habits, how old he is, his hopes and dreams and fears, his past, even the way he walks. A nosy woman could walk like a bird and constantly raise her eyebrows. A grouchy old man could have a limp and the saddest facial expression. If the details aren't specified by your director, make it up. Bring the character to life!  , KNOW THEM! If you don't have your lines memorized, you're sunk! A performance is powerful and smooth if you know what you are supposed to say. I admit, it can be difficult. To help with memorization, you can write down your lines several times. You can practice with friends and family. Practice in front of the mirror, with feeling! Practice does make perfect!  , Blocking is where you are supposed to move and what you are doing with your body. A well-placed gesture can make a dull line interesting. But be careful not to mime everything you're saying.  Your comfort zone is irrelevant. Be must LOUD, get out there! Do not be afraid to make a fool of yourself. When people laugh at you during a performance, you are entertaining them! (This may not be a good sign during a sad, dramatic play though...) Looking and sounding like a total idiot makes for great comedy.  Do not just plow through your lines as soon as the other person finishes! For example, if your co-star says, "Look, a fire-breathing dragon!", jump and frantically look around before you speak.  The fourth wall is the imaginary wall between the audience and the actors. Unless you are specifically told to interact with the audience, DO NOT PAY ANY ATTENTION TO ANYTHING BEHIND THAT WALL. Never ever ever break character. Never giggle when you aren't supposed to. Don't let it be known to the audience that you forgot your line.  If you forgot your lines, think of what your character would say in their situation and say it! (This is difficult in a rhyming script.) Always help out your co-stars, too. For example, if he was supposed to say, "Wow, she is beautiful...", you can cover for him by saying, "I bet you think she's beautiful. Your eyes are popping out of your head." Improvising is difficult, which is why you need to know your lines.  Be respectful to the cast, the directors, and most especially the undervalued crew. Even if you aren't on the best terms with the cast members, put that aside so you can have a wonderful performance! The crew (lights, sound, props and costume workers) is often treated unfairly by the cast because they didn't get a role. Do not tease them. They are important. Keep in mind that your performance would be nothing without them.  You have done everything to prepare. You know your lines and your blocking. The cast and crew is well-rested and ready to go. Your play is darn near perfect! (Maybe not, but always give it your best try.) Relax, go through your lines, and fight back those butterflies! It's really fun to do a warm-up with the whole cast. Break a leg!	Know what acting is!, Know your character!, Learn your lines!, Know the blocking. Be confident!, Get the timing right. Understand the Fourth Wall. If you desperately need to, improvise!, Respect everyone involved. Performance Day!!
Naturally, people want to get their money's worth, and therefore practice is the key to generating revenue.; , Get a Myspace, or even a domain name, and advertise what you do- you won't get any gigs if no-one's heard of you!  , In other words, join as many bands as possible, and push for gigs with them-the more mud you throw, the more will stick.  Even though you're not getting any money, it's still marketing, and doing a good job that is exposed to an audience can never be a bad thing.  You are the client, and they are the boss, and therefore don't try to demand food, drink etc; stick to whatever terms you have previously agreed upon.  If they say, "can you turn down a bit?" or "can you play for a bit longer, please", do so.  This is basic salesmanship, if a person likes you, they will prefer to have you than someone arrogant and unhelpful.  Often, punters will find it hard to remember the names of bands they have seen, so give them a memory aid.  You never know where they might lead. Always be gracious, and should a band disband, for example, keep in touch. If a previous band member goes on to do bigger and better things, you'll want to be a part of it.  Often, you can never be overdressed, and a suit or tie will make you seem much more professional and intelligent than your peers. If it is a rock gig, however, you probably can stray from the "smart" look.  Don't play overcomplicated songs that might alienate them, or songs that would not appeal to your target audience. Play whatever you want for fun, but when money is involved, what the audience wants is what the audience gets.	Be good at what you do. Market yourself. Mudsling. Don't knock unpaid gigs. When you start to get gigs, be reasonable. Be flexible, and tailor your set to their needs, they will doubtless think higher of you, and will therefore be more likely to ask for you back, or do a favor for you in return. Be friendly. Have business cards and fliers. Never sever existing connections. Always dress to impress. Know your audience.
The check engine light will likely be on.  If the catalytic converter is glowing, it's probably clogged. You will have to replace the converter if you find this to be the problem.	Look for stalling, no power when accelerating. Look under the car at night after the vehicle has been running for a while.
This is the longest installation process, because you are actually replacing your sink tap with a Brita brand tap and hoses.  Run your tap water and insert the testing strip Consult the instructions to see under what filtration setting you should set the filter according to your results. , Place a bucket underneath the pipes. Unscrew the pipes with a wrench so that you can remove your current kitchen sink faucet.  Keep the directions close at hand in case you need to identify parts.  The shank is a collar-like metal piece.  Screw the blue hoses into the hole marked “C.” Screw the red hose into the hole marked “H.”   Screw the last hose into the hole marked “B.” Make sure they are secure.  Screw it into the bottom of the tap. , Pull the hoses and shank through the hole.  Loop them through the hoses in that order.  Adjust the dispenser at the top, so that it is positioned correctly. Fix the dispenser in place at the bottom using a wrench.  The red hose will connect with the hot water supply. Next, insert the gasket into the T-piece, which you will place over the cold water intake.  Insert the gaskets into the remaining hoses. Connect each side to the Brita filter device.  The system is ready. Install the wall mount to hold your filter device in place so that it can be unscrewed and replaced when it is no longer effective.  Run the faucet. Check for leaks.  Unlock the current filter, release the pressure handle and pull the filter out. Replace it with a new filter and secure the locking handle.   Reset your timer. Recycle your Brita cartridge.	Unpack your three-way filter tap and dispenser. Remove the timer and testing strip. Mount the filter timer to the inside of your sink cabinet, where it will not get wet.  , Turn off your water taps. Remove all the pieces for the Brita tap and lay it nearby. Slip the shank over the three hoses. Attach the hoses to the inside of the tap. Pull the shank toward the tap. Place your base on the hole in the kitchen counter, where your old tap was installed.  , Mount the tap to the base. Set your counter plate, gasket, locking ring and hexagon nut parts underneath the sink so that you can install them easily. Screw the hexagonal nut into place on the shank. Connect your hoses. Screw the T-piece onto the top of the cold water supply. Insert the filter cartridge into the blue Brita filter device. Turn on the cold water tap. Pay attention to your filter timer so that you know when it’s time to change.
This will help keep the roses stay fresher longer when you stick them into the foam.There are several different types of floral foam. Make sure that you get the kind meant for fresh flowers. You can find it in the floral section of an arts and crafts shop.   Do not use regular white Styrofoam for this. You need the foam to be able to soak up water so that the roses stay fresh. Be careful when handling this type of foam. It is very soft when dry and easily dented.  You can use a fancy bowl, planter, vase, or even a pedestal meant for pillar candles. It should sit below the rim of your bowl, planter, or vase.If the foam is too big, cut it down to the right size and shape.   If you are setting the foam down onto a pedestal, cut it down to a rough dome or orb shape., You can use roses in all one color, or you can experiment using different colors. You can also get different shades of the same color for an ombre effect.Plan on using about 48 roses.If you plan on using multiple shades or colors, put them into separate buckets. This will make sorting through them easier.Consider using fragrant roses. This is a small detail that often gets overlooked but will add a nice touch., Use a clean pair of garden shears and cut the stems at an angle.It would be a good idea to cut off the leaves and thorns as well.   If your foam block is very small, you may want to cut the stems down to about 3 inches (7.63 centimeters).  Insert them close enough so that the blooms touch.Keep adding roses until the foam is no longer visible. You don't have to poke the roses all the way down into the foam.   If you are sticking the roses into a bowl, planter, or vase, consider sticking them in as different depths to create a dome-like effect. If you are going for an ombre effect, start with your lightest color, then move on to the darkest.You can arrange it in stripes or rings.  At this point, your centerpiece is done. You can move it to the table, and leave it as is, or you can add some more touches to it. Here are some ideas:   Arrange short, votive candles around the centerpiece.Scatter glass gems or metallic confetti around the centerpiece. Tie a satin or sheer ribbon around the base of the vessel.	Soak a block of green floral foam in water overnight. Put the foam block into a vessel. Get an assortment of roses and put them into a bucket of water. Cut about 3 inches (7.62 centimeters) off of each stem. Poke the roses into the foam. Add some finishing touches.
Art is very personal and it is not always meant to make you feel good. As a result, you may offend people by giving harsh criticism. Instead, you can comment on the art itself, without saying whether or not you like it. This allows you to comment on the work without giving your personal feelings.Avoid saying things like "I could make that." This type of comment is insulting to the artist and does not promote artistic conversation. If you do dislike a piece, you can explain that it's due to your personal taste. For instance, you can say, "I can see this is well composed. I have trouble looking at this image, though, because it's so dynamic it almost feels violent.”  , A great way to assess a piece of art is by asking questions. If you're going to talk about art, questions are a great way to learn from your companions and promote conversation.Ask if your companion knows much about the artist or the art movement in question. Get the opinion of your companion about a piece.  If you are visiting an art gallery with a group of friends or colleagues and you do not know much about the kind of art you're viewing, feel free to admit to confusion at any point. Some people in your group may actually be relieved to discover that they are not the only person outside of their comfort zone.Pretending to know a lot will be awkward, and isn't necessary. You might say, "Wow, I can tell a lot is going on here, but I don't know where to start."  , The most important thing when you are thinking and talking about art is that it makes you feel something, even if that feeling is unpleasant. Comment on how the piece makes you feel and why. Sometimes the artist will intentionally want the audience to feel uncomfortable. This does not mean you need to judge the quality of work, just the impression that the piece has left on you.For example, you may feel inspired, sad, happy, confused, uncomfortable, angry, etc.	Avoid delivering unnecessary judgements. Ask questions. Acknowledge that you are not an expert. Talk about how the art makes you feel.
While it is fairly easy to install small letters using a dry method, you are far better off using a wet release method providing your supplier offers this goof proof method of installation.; , Some websites allow you to actually design your boat name lettering online, see it on a boat, then order it.  The most difficult part of installing the boat name is that boat names are fairly large decals and it's real easy to tangle them or accidentally seal in large bubbles of air, which is a disaster. Not so with a good wet release system. , Place this solution in a spray bottle. Bring this along with your wet release boat name lettering or registration number decal and a Rubbermaid kitchen spatula or other rubberized straight edge.  Once in place, use black tape or any contrasting color tape to mark your position.  Also spray the decal (sticky side) as you pull the backing away. This will prevent the decal from immediately bonding to the boat or to itself if you should fumble finger the thing.  Slide it around until it hits your marks made in step 6.  Once you are comfortable you have pushed out all the solution you can begin to push firmer and firmer. Go slow. The solution may be pushed out but the decal still has not bonded yet.  Take a break. Cover the whole decal with a moist towel or at the very least, shade it from the sun. Time and moisture will cause the pre-masking to release both from the boat and from the decal.  In about an hour, you should be able to pull the pre-masking off the decal and the letters will stay firmly in place.	Note that there are a number of methods used to apply vinyl boat lettering to the transom of your boat. Go online and search for wet release boat name decals. Look for a wet release system, you can nearly guarantee a perfect job every time. Clean your boat transom or the sides of your boat that will receive the decals.  , Mix a solution of 1 cup of water and about 6-8 drops of Palmolive dish washing detergent. Hold your decal into position and play with it with the backing still on until you get it in the exact position you want. Spray the boat with a good heavy coating of your solution mix. Place the decal in position. Starting in the center, gently squeegee out the solution first working to the right, then to the left. Notice that the application masking that holds your boat name letters in place will begin to turn milky and break down with the solution (the letters themselves are not water soluble, they bond firmer as they dry while the pre-masking breaks down) This process can take a few minutes to an hour or more. Wait.
Summer and fall blooming clematis only produce buds on new growth wood. The pruning can take place anytime from late autumn to early spring. These types of clematis include Polish Spirit and Duchess of Albany., A hard cut refers to a pruning method that essentially cuts the plant back to the ground. In the case of these late blooming clematis, you will cut these plants back nearly to the ground. Some of these clematis will have buds up on the stems, in which case cut just above the buds, but most will just grow back right out of the crown of the plant.Aim for cutting your clematis back to a height between 12 and 18 inches.	Understand that late blooming clematis should be cut back hard. Give your clematis a hard cut.
You will need 1 cup (280 grams) of salt and 1 cup (140 grams) of flour. If you wish to add glitter to your clay, you can do so now. Start with 1 teaspoon of glitter. You can use fine, scrapbooking glitter or chunky, craft glitter, but the fine glitter will be easier to blend. Pour everything into a large mixing bowl and stir to combine.  You will need ½ cup (112.50 milliliters) of warm water. If you wish make colored dough, you can add a few drops of food coloring into the water at this point.  Keep kneading until you have achieved a smooth, dough-like texture.   If the dough is too dry, add a little bit more water. If the dough is too sticky, add some more flour.  Your clay is now ready to use. You can sculpt little figurines out of it, or roll it out and make ornaments out of it.  Start by rolling your clay out flat using a rolling pin. Cut your clay into shapes using a craft knife, a cookie cutter, or a drinking glass. If you wish to hang the ornament, poke a hole near the top of the shape using a drinking straw or a toothpick.   Salt dough can make great keepsakes. Press your child's foot or hand into the dough until there is an imprint.  Transfer your creations onto a baking sheet and bake them in your oven at 212°F (100°C) for three hours. If the dough still hasn't hardened, flip the item over, and bake it for two more hours.	Combine the dry ingredients in a large mixing bowl. Measure out the water. Pour the water into the salt and flour, and knead. Transfer the clay onto a flat surface. Consider making some ornaments or keepsakes with the dough. Consider baking the dough.
Many online vendors sell spandex face-masks, called Morph Masks. If you're planning on making a Spiderman suit to go with your mask, you can buy a full-body Morph Suit as well. Look for a plain red Morph Mask at a costume depot or order one online. It should cost around 15 dollars.; , There are many different versions of Spiderman, between the comics and the films. Some Spiderman costumes feature dark eye-lenses, while others show a Spiderman with bright, reflective eyes. Buy a large pair of sunglasses in the tint that you prefer for your costume, dark or bright.Make sure the glasses have very large lenses. Each lens will become an eye on your mask, so take some reference pictures of Spiderman with you when you go shopping. Look in the women's sunglasses section, as many women's styles feature larger lenses.  For an alternative look, consider using a sheet of silver or dark auto tint for the eyes of your mask. It will make for a similar effect as the sunglasses, but the material is flexible instead of rigid. You can ask an auto detailing shop if they have any scraps, then cut it into the shape of the eyes. You won't need very much, so they should be able to help you out., To create the "web" pattern on Spiderman's mask, you'll have to decide between a black Sharpie or black fabric paint. This will depend on your aesthetic preference. Sharpie will create flat, matte lines, while puff paint or fabric paint will create raised, textured lines. Be aware that you may have to hand-wash your mask regardless of which marker type you choose. Both can be damaged by machine washing., Many craft stores carry inexpensive hot glue guns. Pick one up or use one that you already own. Make sure that you have plenty of glue sticks handy so that you don't run out in the middle of your project.  Lay the spandex mask on a flat surface, like a table or desk. Make sure you lay it with the front facing up, because you'll obviously want to draw the eyes on the front of the mask. If you have a styrofoam head or dummy head, feel free to use this as well. It will give you a better vantage point for designing your mask and visualizing it on your own head., Using a pencil or a ballpoint pen, sketch out the size and shape of the eyes that you want. Use a reference photo to get an idea of how you want the eyes to look, relative to the mask size. Remember to check your sunglasses against the eye size: you want the sunglasses' lenses to be larger than the size of the eyes.  Put one hand inside the mask, then hold a pair of scissors with your other hand. Carefully pierce a hole directly on the line of one eye, then begin to cut along the line. Once the first eye is completely cut out, do the same for the second eye. Make sure that your scissors are sharp and your hands are steady, otherwise your cuts could turn out jagged or uneven.Look at photos of Spiderman as a reference to get an idea of the shape of the eyes. In most incarnations of Spiderman, his eyes are roughly triangular, with a straight line on top and a U-shaped line forming the lower eyelid.  The lenses of most sunglasses will pop out easily when you apply pressure. Hold the frame with both hands, then push out the lenses gently with your thumbs. Make sure not to push too hard, or the lenses might break., Let your hot glue gun warm up, then apply a thin line to the outside of one lens. Holding the neck of the mask open with one hand, use your other hand to move the glued lens inside of the mask. Hold the lens directly under one of the eye holes, then adhere the glue to the fabric inside the mask. Make sure that the eye hole is completely filled by the lens, and that there are no gaps.Apply the second lens. Using the exact same method, glue a thin line to the other lens and then affix it to the inside of the mask, creating the second eye. If you place the lens incorrectly at first, you will have a few seconds to move it before the glue dries. Apply light pressure to the side of the lens to fill the eye-hole while the glue is still hot. The glue will take around 15 seconds to set, so keep in mind the amount of time you have left to make changes.  Spiderman has thick black borders around both eyes, so you'll need to draw these on. Using your sharpie or fabric paint, sketch out a 1/2" border around each eye, then fill it in completely. If you are feeling a bit more ambitious, cut out some black fabric from an old t-shirt in the correct shape, then hot-glue it on.  Look in a comic book or online for a reference photo, then copy Spiderman's web patterns onto the mask. If you're uncomfortable free-handing the webs, try sketching them on with a pencil first, then erasing and adjusting till they're just right. Then, use your Sharpie or Fabric paint to draw over the penciled lines., Now that your mask has been hot-glued and accented, you'll need to let it dry. Read your bottle of fabric paint and the hot-glue instructions for specific times. The glue itself may dry in around a minute, but fabric paint may take up to 72 hours to dry, depending on the brand., Once your mask has dried, go ahead and try it on. Pair it with a homemade Spiderman costume, or wear it on its own. It'll be perfect for Halloween, Super Hero events, or costume parties.	Get a red spandex mask. Buy a pair of large-frame sunglasses. Use window tint for the eyes. Buy a black Sharpie, black fabric paint or puff paint. Get a hot glue gun. Lay your mask out flat. Sketch out the eyes. Cut out the mask's eyes. Take out the sunglasses' lenses. Hot glue the lenses inside the mask. Draw the eye borders. Draw on webs. Let it dry. Try it on.
There aren't any hard and fast rules when it comes to knitting needle requirements for working with certain types of yarn. Choose a yarn that you enjoy and realize that chunkier yarns will knit up faster than thin or fine yarn. The same is true of your needles. If you'd like a larger looser blanket, work on larger needles.   Consider using size 19 US or 15.0 mm needles and super chunky yarn to create a large blanket that comes together quickly.; , Find the end of your yarn which is usually tucked into the middle of the ball of yarn. Make a loop near the end of the yarn as though you're going to tie a knot. The long end should be on top of the short end. Fold the top loop over to the inside of the loop. Pick up the loop and pull it through tightly. Slip this loop onto one of your knitting needles and pull the end to tighten it.          You'll know you've correctly made a slip knot if you can can simply continue pulling the loop and it comes apart.  Hold the needle with the slip knot in your right hand. Drape the working yarn over the palm of your left hand so your fingers can close into a loose fist and grab it. Wrap your thumb around the yarn so that it threads behind your thumb (if your palm is facing you). Use the point of your needle to thread underneath your thumb. Pull the needle through so that the yarn is lifted off your your thumb and onto your needle.  Cast on until you have 14 stitches on your needle. This will eventually be an edge of one of your patchwork squares. Each square will measure about 20cm (7.5 inches). Transfer the needle with the stitches to your left hand so you can begin knitting.Continue grasping the yarn in your palm with your fingertips, this will keep it out of the way and create tension so that you can quickly cast on.  Hold the needle that doesn't have any stitches on it in your right hand. Insert the tip of this needle into the stitch closest to the tip of the other needle.   You should insert it under the stitch so that the needle goes from front to back and forms an "X".  Grab the working yarn with your right hand and wrap it around the right needle so that it's in between the needles. Slowly pull the right needle down and through the yarn on the left needle.          You should keep the working yarn between the needles while you do this.  Your right needle should now be on top of the left needle. Pull this stitch off the left needle by lifting the right needle up and away from the left needle. This will transfer the stitch from the left needle to the right needle.         Try to work near the end of the needles so that the stitches don't become tight on the middle of the needles. But, make sure that they're not so close to the ends of the needles that the stitches fall off.  Knit each of the stitches that you cast on until you come to the end. This makes a complete row of garter stitches. Transfer the needle with the stitches to your left hand and continue knitting them to make another row. Knit rows until your square measures 20cm (7.5 inches).         Make sure you knit into the stitches that are looped onto the left needle, not the stitches of the row you just completed.  Keep the needle that has your knitted square in your left hand. Knit two stitches onto the empty needle in your right hand. You'll use these stitches to cast off the rest of the square that's on the other needle. You should always have two stitches on the right needle.Casting off or binding off will work the square off of the needles. This means you'll be able to take it off the needles without worrying that it will come undone. You'll be able to sew this square to another completed square when you assemble the blanket.  Push the tip of the left needle into the first stitch on your right needle. This should be the first stitch that you knit on this needle., Use the tip of the left needle to lift the first stitch over the second stitch. This means you'll be lifting the stitch and sliding it off of the right needle. You should now have only one stitch on the right needle.  You'll always need two stitches on the right needle so that you can lift up and over a stitch to cast it off. Continue casting off the stitches until you reach the end of the row.         You should have a completely empty needle and only one stitch still on the other needle.  Remove the needle from the last stitch. You should see a big loop. Hold onto this so that it doesn't come unraveled and use scissors to cut the working yarn. Leave about an arm's length of yarn when you cut it. Take the yarn and tie it through the loop, pulling it tightly.         You'll still have extra yarn tailing from the end of your square after you've tied it off. You'll use this to sew the squares together.  You can make the blanket as large as you like, keeping in mind that you'll need to knit more squares. For a large square blanket, you might want to use seven squares across by seven squares down.Consider laying out your squares on a large surface so you can arrange them, especially if you used different colored yarn. Alternate the squares so that the rows are vertical next to a square where the rows are turned horizontal.  Select the squares you'll be sewing together. Take a large sewing needle and thread the yarn from a square's tail. Adjust the square so that the square you're sewing it to is turned opposite.         For example, if the square with the sewing tail has rows arranged horizontally, the square you're sewing it to should be arranged vertically.  Take the threaded sewing needle and insert it into the stitch of the square that's laying next to it. Pull the needle so the yarn tightens. Insert the needle back into the square with the tail you're using. You should be stitching the two squares together by going back and forth with the yarn.         Continue doing this till you reach the end of the squares. The two squares should be completely sewn together now.  You'll be left with tails of yarn on your squares that you won't need to sew into other squares. Take your tail and thread it onto the needle. But, instead of using it to connect to another square, simply weave it in between the knots on one square's edge. Make a knot in the yarn and cut it off so that it doesn't come undone.         Weaving in the end can prevent a loose end from unraveling and can make your knitting look more polished.  Continue sewing together squares until you have seven squares in a row. Create seven of these rows total so you can stitch together every row and make a large blanket. Or, make a smaller blanket by using fewer squares. You can also make a rectangular blanket by making the rows shorter than the blanket is long.Consider adding beads and other decorative objects to your knitting. You could also just sew on the beads afterwards. Also consider adding knit flowers, leaves, or decorative edging.	Gather your yarn and knitting needles. Make a slip knot. Cast on a stitch. Continue casting on. Insert the right needle. Wrap the yarn around the needle. Complete the stitch. Continue knitting. Knit. Insert the left needle onto the right needle. Lift the stitch over. Knit another stitch and cast it off. Tie off the square. Knit more squares. Thread the yarn. Sew the edges of two squares together. Weave in the ends. Assemble your blanket.

These are the building blocks of your writing.; , One set of four quarter notes played correctly can be much more effective than three or four measures of complex material.  Often you'll find yourself in a haze of your own playing. Avoid these mistakes:   Forget. A long series of notes can be tricky to remember, especially when different rudiments are involved. Overplay. Remember that a drum line is only as good as its weakest drummer, and if he/she cannot keep up, the entire drum cadence is weakened Solo. This is flashy, fun, eye grabbing, and may reflect great skill, but often in solos, the tempo is lost and will sound horrible with the rest of the line. Save excessive showboating for I & E's.  Do eight or nine counts then stop. Repeat those counts three or four times. Then, if you like it, write it.  This is most likely your snare part.  Sometimes ripples are nice, or even dynamic quarters. Steady quarters are another option. Sometimes only the offbeat will give a funky sound to the line. It all depends.  paradiddles, flams, etc. These sometimes help dynamics on either hand or at different points. They are also more professional.  Yes, it may be boring sounding now, but your quads/quints are going to spice up even the simplest of cadences.  A general rule to follow is to make sure every accent on the snare and bass drums is hit by the quads on a different drum. For example, if the snare drum accents every other beat, make sure every other beat gets a different drum.  Use all manner of rudiments, accents, and even make chords with different drums. Even clapping and hands playing are effective.  Cymbals are much more than crashes and hi-hats. Sometimes even the most basic cymbal parts can add a completely different sound to your cadence. Ask a friend who plays cymbals about all the different sounds and techniques you can create with a pair of cymbals. You might be surprised.  Do not let one section overpower the rest of the line.  Emphasize them for every section.  Nobody's first song was awesome. All people who write music had to start somewhere. Mistakes and experimentation are how you learn; they're how music develops.	Have a basic knowledge of notes, time signature, rhythm, and pitch. Keep it simple. Put down the sticks. Tap out some quarter notes and say, (don't tap), a rhythm that pops into mind. Repeat last step until a fluent piece is written. Go through the cadence one measure at a time and think of a cool bassline. Go through both parts of the whole cadence and look for opportunities to work in rudiments, e.g. Go through once more and finalize those two parts. Begin the quints/quads part. Incorporate more than one drum. Ask a friend or a colleague who is experienced in writing cymbal literature to write a cymbal part to the cadence. Balance and regulate. Know where the most powerful parts are in the music. Most importantly, practice.
To make a coiled flower, you first need to create a strip that you will coil up and form into a flower. Start by making a chain of 30 stitches. This will be your foundation chain for the strip.To make the first chain, yarn over your hook twice and pull the first loop through the second loop. Then, loop the yarn over the hook again and pull it through the other loop. Keep doing this to continue making the chain.; , After you have made your chain, do a double crochet stitch into the first stitch in your chain.To double crochet, loop the yarn over the hook, and then insert the hook through the stitch and loop the yarn over again. Pull the yarn through the first stitch, then loop the yarn over again. Pull the yarn through the next two stitches, and then yarn over again. Pull through the last two stitches to complete the stitch., For the next chain, double crochet twice into the same stitch. This will help to expand the strip so that the petals will fan out after you coil them., Keep going back and forth between double crocheting once and double crocheting twice all the way to the end of the row. When you reach the end, your strip is complete., To finish the strep and prepare it for coiling, cut the yarn several inches away from the last stitch. Then, pull the end of the yarn through to secure the stitch and tie the two ends together. Thread the ends through the eye of a darning needle., Starting with the end finished on, begin rolling the strip like a jelly roll. Roll the strip so that the edges stay even and the coil is tight, but not so tight that it is stretching the yarn. Keep coiling until you reach the end of the strip., After you finish coiling the strip, take the needle and insert it through multiple layers on the back side of the flower. This will be the side that does not fan out. It will look more like the base of a flower.Sew through all of the layers using several stitches and then tie off the yarn once the flower is secure. You can leave the excess thread if you plan to use it to attach the flower to something, or you can cut the excess thread if you do not plan to use it.  To add a finishing touch to your flower, you can sew some beads into the center. Or, you can also sew a decorative button into the center. This will make your flower look more flower-like and add a nice touch of shine or color., If you want to accent your flower even more, then try making a couple of crocheted leaves. You can sew these onto the edges of your coiled flower to make it look even more like a flower.  Use green yarn to make your leaves.  You can leave your coiled flower around as a decorative piece or you can attach it to something. Try sewing your flower onto a hat, sweater, or scarf. Or, you can use hot glue to attach the flower to something as well.	Chain 30. Double crochet one time in the first stitch. Do two double crochet stitches in second stitch. Continue this pattern to the end of the chain. Tie yarn ends together and thread through darning needle. Begin coiling the strip. Sew through the layers on the back side. Sew on some beads or a button. Make a couple of leaves for accents. Attach the flower with hot glue or yarn.
A slide is supposed to be a continuous sound. You pick the note, holding down your finger, then slide up or down the neck while you can still hear the first note. You should hear the pitch of the note move with your finger -- getting higher if you move towards your body and lower if you move away.          A slide is noted on a tab by a slash. Slides down are forward slashes (/) and slides up are backslashes (\). For example, a slide from the 3rd fret to the 5th, and then back, is noted by "3/5\3."; , Make sure you use your fingertips to fret, as they are more precise and harder than your fleshy finger pads. You need to hold the note down hard, but still lightly enough that you can slide down the string.          Start slow -- slide from one fret to the other, focus on keeping the note playing the whole time. Newer strings are always easier to slide on than older ones. Fresh strings are almost always worth it.  If you see a tab with a / before a fret, with no number before the slash, this means you just slide into the note from anywhere. In the above lick, you can slide into the third note for a classy, smooth entrance to the solo.  Slides to the 3rd note or the flat 5th note are often the most bluesy places you can start moving. By "3rd note," this means the 3rd note in your pentatonic scale. The flat 5th is the blues note located between the 3rd and 4th notes in the pentatonic scale. The notes are bolded below, in the key of A.          e|---------------------5-8-9--------------| B|--------------------5-8----------------- G|----------------5-7-8-------------------| D|---------5-7----------------------------| A|-----5-6-7-----------------------------| E|-5-8------------------------------------|  , You can slide power chords, single notes, or even double note sets. Try, for example, sliding the 3rd fret on the bottom two strings (the thinnest ones), down to the 4th fret and back up. This little slide fits nicely in the key of E-blues, and you should get used to little slides down here for bluesy accent notes.	Fret a note, play it, and slide to another fret without picking up your fingers. Keep your finger pressing down hard against the string for the entire slide. Slide into notes for a smooth start to a solo. Aim for slides on your 3rd and flat 5th notes for extra bluesy playing. Know that you can slide across multiple strings.

At the beginning of each show after a fly-in effect of a question that related to general knowledge (but had nothing to do with the show in question) but that could have either been short-answer or multiple choice, the narrator said "If you could answer this and a bunch of other questions, maybe you've got what it takes to..." and the viewer could here the audience scream "Make the Grade" as you saw the show logo fly onto the screen. The show music would then begin - most viewers and fans remember this music - even to this day. The narrator would come back a few seconds after the show's icon would randomly change colors and flash these differences every few milliseconds (then quickly fly off the screen and disappear) and with a quick rhetoric referring to the introduction of the host (something along the lines of "And here's with your space-age host and didn't ever tell a joke that you didn't like...") and introduced the host's name. The host would walk across the screen until he arrived behind his own podium on-set and stood before the contestants. The host would most-often thank the narrator and welcome all the contestants to the game, then explain the episode's game board and rules and the game would begin.     ; , This game had a few rounds that you had to get through, that will be described below., Players competed on answering questions, based on the game board that is described in a subsequent step. Players had to complete a game board so that each player had to solve one question in each grade level as well as one question in each category, and while that seemed too simple to accomplish, with the possibility of three teams vying for the same space, this seemed quite complicated. The first team to do so won the game and the right to advance to the Honors round, as well as a monetary gain of $500 and the same pair of British Knights sneakers (the losers would also be given). It was tracked on the players game board in front of them and (as you'll see later), lights lit up on the board as the questions were answered. If no player finished their game board, the player with the most question lights on their game boards won the game and was chosen to advance to the Honors round.  Losers of the Question round got $50 for their appearance on the show as well as a free pair of British Knights sneakers to take home with them.  This round was a final Grand Prize round that resulted in more cash and in the second and third season(described below) a trip right back to Universal Studios (now called Universal Studios Orlando). At first, players had to choose a category out of three possible choices: In one specific situation, you could have been presented with Dogs, Cats or Mice (just as an example) and each question that you answered from the set of 7 questions from seven categories relating to that top-level category still led you to money. Generally, these seven questions generally related back to the same seven categories the player would have seen from the day's Question round. Each correct answer was worth $100, though once you answered question 7 right, you won the Grand Prize of a total of $1000 or the trip (dependent on season). Players could pass on a question and more often rarely got back to trying again - otherwise if answered incorrectly, they were told they were wrong but were unable to answer again and could never win the bonus question. The player was given 45 seconds to answer all seven questions., During the second and third season, this game was more often a space filler than any real part of the process in the game. Players were given several more questions which didn't really have any real category to them. More often the contestant was rather easily able to answer them. The contestant was given a question at a low dollar amount at first. If they answered the question correctly, they were given this money at the end, and they could choose to go onwards to the next question. If the next question was answered correctly, they could go onwards yet again and so on. There were questions for winnings of $50, $100, $200, $500 and $1000; players had to begin at the beginning and work their way up to the $1000. . However, miss a question or ask to pass and you end up loosing the University Round and only walk out with the money from the Question and Honors rounds with no money from the University round., Other season space fillers included (first season) the host (as you'll see later) Lew Schneider traveling to malls and asking random mall walkers questions for minimal money while on the third season the host would walk out into the audience and begin asking random people questions for T-shirts and other random small prizes. If the game was won way too early and the University Round couldn't cover it without even more time, a second game had to begin but was played in abbreviated time. However, playing an abbreviated game as a tie-in at the end was super-rare., The beginning question was answered and in a two sentence summary, a summary was given to answer it. The credits then rolled and the game concluded with the credits and such rolling onscreen., Contestants drew from a mechanical split-flap game board that had a total of 49 squares on it. It was 7 squares vertical by 7 squares horizontal. Each of these boards had seven categories to choose from (from the vertical direction) and several "grade levels" (going horizontally). It was operated mechanically and everytime a player asked to see what was behind this door (whether it be a question the players had to answer, a challenge (that you'll learn about in an upcoming step) that this show called a "Fire Drill", take a square or loose a square space), the home viewer could hear the clicking of the doors as they were opened and closed. You couldn't see the wires, but you could tell that this wasn't something that was technological in design (as many other Nickelodeon TV game shows could tout.)  Players could pick from several categories. Most often this consisted of art or science or social studies or math or however, along with one "special elective" that rarely ever fit into other categories on the board. Along the top, they had several grade levels consisting of Elementary as well as grade levels between 7th and 12th grade.  Sometimes players even picked squares that had already been revealed and had to be either told that it was already chosen by another team or if it led to a loose a square space that was already revealed, tended not to change and the action was taken yet again - thereby making players even that much more depressed at their actions.   As a player, you could run into several types of squares and square designations. They had squares for each team's colors, along with squares marked with a question mark (for when the host had to ask the teams to answer a question), Take (for when the team could take a square of another team's color as their own) or Loose (when a team would lose their color-denoted square) as well as black squares which were designations of squares that were answered by all teams but were answered incorrectly. There was a Free square which could help a team take another square without being penalized or having to answer a question, but these were rather rare (especially in the second and third season). had denoted squares that had been lost from the Loose-a-Square space elsewhere on the board.  Fire drills were similar to Physical Challenges (but without the messiness) on Nickelodeon's Double Dare. Almost most were physical, they involved all three players partaking in challenges. Although it seemed like games never crossed between one episode and another, one fan could notice that the directions of using a fake hammer to toss a stuffed rat" onto a toy that looked like an enlarged mousetrap until the trap snapped onto the mouse. Generally, the winners of these contests got their choice of what color spot they'd like to return to and most often the winner chose to move to the team with the highest other square. These changes were cheesy and could sometimes mean a big win for a team even if the move only lasted a few minutes., The set was comprised of several items. Although it seemed like the shots were taken in a cubed room that was tilted at an angle, there were several items in this room.  The game board was at the top-most corner, but was tilted at an angle so that the players could easily read it. Closer to the audience but away from the players (if an imaginary line was drawn) was the host and host's podium (a cylindrical stand that was yellow in color with colored paint blotches). Across from the game board in the top right corner and off to the players' right were the location of the Fire Drills. The viewer and fan could tell that this was the corner when you saw almost equal podiums in this corner when the camera was changed so the players were shown getting up from their desks and walking to the Fire Drill location. Across the alleyway from the host's desk, you could see the contestant desk areas. One main thing that stood out was the light board for each team and below it and expanded over all three desks was a yellow banner with the show insignia on it. You could tell the light board was there and how it was set up when you saw a square-like light board with one row of lights for the categories and one row of all the grade levels (as was described previously). Each desk looked like an enlarged student desk from a school with that special game board in front of it where you'd generally see the student's knees, legs and feet. Behind that, sometimes you could see the player's selection buttons and desk, but these times were varied, but sometimes you could tell when the players were moving to get to the FIre Drill location in the studio set. Behind this even still, you'd find the player sitting on their stools which at times looked like even more like the podiums used for the host desk and Fire Drill holding place, while at other times in other seasons looked like the chairs like a student desk without the cross bar attaching it to the desk portion - these were freely movable but didn't seem to have rollers. They were steady, but you could tell there was some space in between them but were firm and were unmovable.  On Make the Grade, there were three teams. They each wore one color, that was either red, green or blue. In later episodes, green was changed to yellow., Players generally were seen wearing yellow t-shirts (no matter what team color they were on) with the show logo (described later in this article) across the player's chest on the shirt. In the first season, the show logo was more centered across the entire shirt and the contestants baby-blue/light-blue like colored index card-like nametag in the player's shirtpocket-like corner. In the second season, the show logo became more pronounced in the corner and the yellow-colored (that sometimes even matched the color of the shirt) nametag would be worn on the opposite side of the shirt.  The host however, never wore any certain same shirt. He'd wear something more casual and most often could be seen wearing a sweater or sweatshirt on the set. TV viewers could rarely see what the contestants wore as far as their pants or shoes, so this article can't vouch for these details. However, most often contestants on a Nickelodeon game show were given sneakers (brand logo information omitted) upon the rights to use brand marketing as advertisements at the end of the show.  The show's icon was rather whimsical. Although the elliptical format of the logo with the weird writing that had some letters in all caps, the logo extended in all the corners into what made the logo appear to be some spaceship-like logo., During the first season, Lew Schneider hosted the show. This was Lew's first real acting job as the host of a show. However, Lew went on to host, produce and direct other shows including some of the 1999 season of Everybody Loves Raymond (among others) and is currently the producer of the hit TV show The Goldbergs.On the other hand, during the second season, they replaced Lew and brought in Robb Edward Morris who, much like Lew, had his initial appearance on Make the Grade which brought him fame, but who hasn't had a decent time with other roles, having last acted in 2016 on the show "Aquarius" but having two upcoming roles in two TV shows in 2017., During the entire run of the show, this show had an announcer named Maria Milito. This was Maria's one and only acting-announcing job and has no other upcoming gigs., This show aired between October 2, 1989 and December 29, 1991 on Nickelodeon for a total of 160 episodes over the course of three seasons (Fall-Winter 1989, Spring 1990 and Fall-Winter 1990).These episodes were re-released in syndication as reruns on the Nick Gas channel (between January 2,2000 and April 2,2004) until that too was dropped (when the station went belly-up and couldn't make a comeback). Each episode lasted about 23 or 24 minutes, but along with advertisements, this show was shown during a half-hour block of time once or twice a week over the course of a weekend schedule.

If you’re in a town where there are a lot of burlesque shows, then you will want to think of how your show can be different from the rest of the pack. A themed burlesque show or a variety show, are the two most frequently developed types of shows. New York’s current themed Burlesque shows include: Cosplay Burlesque (a burlesque show that included performers dressing up as various anime characters), D20 Burlesque (a monthly burlesque show that uses board games as the theme), David Lynch Burlesque (David Lynch films are the theme of this monthly burlesque show), Hyper gender Burlesque (Summer, 1,001 Arabian Nights, Cornucopia, and Freedom have all been the subject of this unique monthly burlesque show where both theme and cast change monthly). Nothing is off limits in terms of themes: Storybook Burlesque and Book Club Burlesque both use books as their subject matter.   The concept of a variety show is no longer a novelty in itself, with more and more burlesque performers studying skills like fire eating, glass walking, sword swallowing, and contortion these performers instantly add a touch of variety to any show they are booked in. Many producers will also hire magicians, comedians, or drag artist who can double as host and performer. Spice! an evening of variety recently returned to the New York nightlife scene with a complete redesign. Producers opted to scrap the original format of burlesque, sideshow, comedy for a historical theme, in which all acts are connected by a story line. Scripted shows involve group rehearsals, which in itself create an added cost for a production. For your first production it is best to start small (including budget size), but whatever the concept of your show, make it something you love.; , Is this a one hour show with intermission? Is it an all night 4 hour affair? Look around at other burlesque shows and see what the popular production length is. If most shows in your town are only one hour, then that could be because other producers have already figured out that audiences are only willing to commit an hour to burlesque entertainment. That doesn’t mean your show has to be an hour. You may decide you want to be the producer offering what is not currently available in your town, and then proceed in producing a 2 hour or 4 hour event.  Unless you own a bar or theater, you’ll need a place to put on the show. Start your search by looking at venues that already house burlesque events. If you see multiple burlesque shows at the same venue, then there’s a good chance the venue has a following for the burlesque scene and that other producers will be happy to know you are looking to bring something to the same venue. If all the shows seem to be from just one producer, you may want to contact that producer to find out they’re experience with the venue. This is not mandatory. Unless that producer owns the venue, you can proceed with contacting the venue and asking for a performance date. Being a bit old fashioned, I think it’s always fun to meet your neighbor. They may be able to help you with something down the road and if they become competition it’s good to know who you are competing against. Remember step 2. Guess what? Where your show will be may influence how long the show will be. If the bar only books acts that are 1 hour, then if you want to use that bar you will have to offer them a 1 hour show. Why do I suggest picking show length before venue? Because if you are truly set on that 4 hour event, then you’ll know what venues to pass up while you are searching for the best performance spot.  Okay, so you know what kind of show your will do, how long it will be, and where you will do it, unless you are doing a solo (if so then skip to step 5), you’ll need other performers. Do you have friends that are also looking for more stage time and would be interested in your theme? If not, put the word out to other performers asking them to join your show. 10 performers in 1 hour is probably too many.   To figure out how many performers are needed you’ll want to look at: the average length of the routine + the amount of time necessary for setup/ clean up= X then... X divided by,(the length of the show – intermission)= approximate number of acts. So for example if I have a 1 hour show and I want each routine to be between 3-5 minutes, and I figure some people will leave lots of clothes on stage and some will have lots of set up, then I’m adding an extra 5 minutes for setup/cleanup. 5 minutes + 5 minutes= 10 minutes, then 10 minutes / (60 minutes- 10 minute intermission) = 5 acts needed. I know that I will want to book at least 5 acts to fill my 1 hour show, if I decide to perform as well, then I might only need 4 more performers to fill up the evening or I might add myself as a 6th performer. This way, if most of the routines are closer to 3 minutes with zero cleanup, at least I don’t have to worry about the show wrapping up too early.  You have the ideal show, the ideal venue, and you are about ready to find the ideal cast. Before you start booking know what kind of money you do or don’t have. Is the venue charging you for space (room rental fee, portion of ticket sales, bar guarantee), if they are, then you’ll want to think about how you plan on covering that cost. Next think about who is doing sound, who is hosting, and who is doing setup/ cleanup (the stage kitten). Do you know someone who can do at least one of those things for free? Do you want to guarantee that the dancers make money? If so, how much? If you are already over budget, maybe think about bringing in fewer performers but asking them to bring 2 routines.   If you hire 2 performers other than yourself, then you still have 6 acts (2 performers + 1 you, multiplied by 2 acts each), but for a lot less money. Now add up the money you need to cover all expenses and divide that be half the available seats in the venue or average audience size. The more you produce the more you will work with “average audience size” in your budgets. For now you can just look around at shows you’ve been to in your town. In New York, there are so many shows every day of the week, that 20 is not an unreasonable average audience size. So if you have a room rental fee of $200 for 1 hour. That's Space $200 + $0 for your boyfriend the DJ + $0 for the stage kitten who is new to burlesque and is doing me a favor + $25 for your friend the comedian who will host + $75 guarantee for the 3 dancers including you = $300 for your show, not including marketing cost. Then $300/ 20= $15 ticket price per person. Once you know the minimum you need to make, adjust your ticket price according to what local shows cost and what your customer would be comfortable paying. If the other burlesque shows in you area charge $5 you will not be able to easily sell tickets for $15 unless you can show you are providing something that is worth the extra cost.  You’ll want to use as many sources of free marketing and advertising that’s available to you. Maybe a friend can design a postcard. Submitting the event to your local newspaper is free. Creating a Facebook event page is free. Emailing all your friends is also free. If your budget allows you’ll want to make money available for postcard or flyer printing, and the occasional paid ad, but remember to keep things simple for your first show. If you like producing, then it won’t be long before you’ll be creating bigger budgets and rhinestone filled dreams.	Think of a concept for your show. Decide on the length of the event. Select a performance venue. Cast your show. Create a budget!, Once you’ve worked out if you can afford to produce your dream then book the venue, book the performers, and start promoting!
; , For example, on weekends you could do more than an hour, like two or three, or even more. This is very helpful because it pulls you out of the routine of piano playing, and lets you practice more and perfect the pieces you play.  For example, if you are taking piano lessons and are about to play a new piece, you could try searching on the internet for videos or songs and hear how it sounds. This can be very helpful because it teaches you how a song is played and lets you recognize the 'emotion,' the piece is giving off.  For example, if the piece starts with an 'mp' (mezzo-piano) it only means 'moderately soft' these dynamics don't have specific volume levels. If you are practicing, you don't need to play accordingly and then have a difficulty hearing yourself, you should only play as it tells you when you are actually trying to play it properly.  This can be very helpful, because it's almost like scanning a paragraph and looking at the picture. It helps you to understand what the passage is trying to convey before you actually read it and lets you know what comes next. This is the same with music, and it can help you stop making mistakes.  Don't look at them as a burden, but instead as a pat on the arm informing you of avoiding that the next time.  For example, if the time signature is 3/4, then count the notes in each bar as you play. This can be helpful because it helps you judge how quickly or slowly a note should be played, but you don't need to count in the piece after you have played it well.  This can be challenging at first, as some people are shy or lack confidence. But this helps with your playing, and you will become more confident about playing in front of people.  For example, a much more advanced pianist or a piano teacher can be a lot of help. When they play something, it makes you understand how the piece should be played, therefore helping you play it better.  Many people feel that they are excellent when they're playing the piano alone but not nearly as good when playing in front of others. Try not to play too fast or too slow to impress people, even if no one's there. Maintaining a more comfortable tempo helps you concentrate on not making mistakes. When you have become comfortable with the piece at that tempo, you can speed up or slow down depending on the piece.	Try practicing about an hour a day, or half an hour if you have a busy schedule or can't find time. Do extra practice whenever you have more time. Listen to the song or piano piece you are playing. Try not to look at the dynamics in a piece, as rules you cannot break. Practice sight-reading and don't worry about making mistakes. Pay close attention to your mistakes. Count as you play during practice according to the time signature. Play in front of friends and family. Ask someone to play the piece you are practicing for you. Concentrate on playing the piece properly.
Fill a large bucket or sink with cool to room temperature water. Immerse the leather in the water for about 10 minutes, or until it becomes thoroughly soaked.   Note that this process works best when used with vegetable tanned leather. You can technically stiffen the leather by soaking it in nothing but room temperature water, but it will only become mildly harder and you will not be able to shape it. The addition of a hot water step will allow you to make structural changes while hardening the leather further.; , As your leather soaks, fill a large stockpot with water and set it on the stove over high heat. Continue heating the water until it reaches a temperature of 180 degrees Fahrenheit (82 degrees Celsius).Use an accurate thermometer to keep track of the temperature. If the water is too hot or too cold, your results can vary dramatically from those described here. If you do not have a thermometer, you can gauge the temperature of the water by slowly heating it on the stove and testing it every minute or so with your bare hand. If you can keep your hand immersed in the water, it is safe to use that temperature for your leather. Once you can no longer bear to keep your hand in the water for more than an instant, remove the water from the heat source and do not allow it to get any hotter. Some people prefer to soak the leather in boiling water. Doing so stiffens the leather at a faster pace, but it also gives you less control. The resulting leather can become very brittle and may be unevenly stiff across its surface.  Pull the leather out of the cool water and immerse it in the hot water. Let it remain there for a few minutes.   After the first minute, you should already see the leather darken and curl. The longer you soak the leather, the stiffer it will become. If you soak the leather too long, however, it will be more brittle when dry. When using this method, soaking the leather in hot water for 30 seconds after it already darkens will result in a piece of leather that is hard but not inflexible. This means that the total hot water soak time would be about 90 seconds. Leave the leather in the water for a longer period of time if you want to make it stiffer.  When you pull the leather out of the water, it should be fairly flexible. If you need the form the leather into a specific shape, now is the time to do so.   When wet, the leather will be stretchy and easy to form. This stretchiness will vanish within the first minute or two, though, so you need to work fast if you plan to stretch it out. The leather will still remain flexible for up to an hour after the stretchiness fades away, though.  Let the leather sit out at room temperature for several hours. After it dries, the leather should be notably thicker and stiffer.   Stiffened leather will also shrink, so the piece you started out with may not look as large when you finish the process.	Soak the leather in cool water. Heat a second pot of water. Dunk the leather in the hot water. Shape as desired. Allow the leather to dry at room temperature.
You can do so by looking at some pictures of Yuuki and sewing it yourself. If you aren't keen on sewing, ask a friend or family member who is proficient in the skill to make the costume for you. You can also buy it online at a cosplay shop. If you want to cosplay Yuuki in her academy dress, her multiple artwork dresses, or her winter cloak, buy it or sew it after seeing reference pictures. Remember that she likes to dress in soft pastel colors.; , Yuuki is seen wearing a necklace with the crest of her school. Also, she wears a small metal bracelet that allows her to control Zero. You might also want to get her staff/scythe, Artemis. Otherwise, she is seen with detailed jewelry and clothing in several artworks.  Have medium-length, brown hair or get a wig. Unless you want to cosplay Yuuki as a vampire, then you need long brown hair down to your lower back. You can also buy a wig for that as well. Remember that she likes to wear cute "Alice bands" in her hair, mostly in pastel colors.  If you have very large breasts, you may want to bind them but it's not really necessary. You could use thin cloth to bind. Don't use bulky cloth because that would make it obvious.  If you have brown eyes, no need to wear burgundy contacts, but you might like it, though, since her eyes are more reddish brown. To emphasize eyes, wear MAKEUP! Yuuki is a bit of a tomboy, so she's not the type to wear a full face of makeup, but to get those big anime/manga eyes, wear black or brown eyeliner in a anime/manga shape on the upper and lower lash-line, some mascara, and false lashes if you are up to it. Use pictures of Yuuki online for ideas.  Also, you might like to hang with some Yori or Kaien cosplayers, the people dear to Yuuki. As Yuuki is a very social and talkative person, cos-playing with some others will let you look more like her.  Yuuki is very naive, comedic, and optimistic, but also very indecisive. Learn about her character and her traits, like being not able to cook something eatable or enjoying parfait.  Yuuki is known for her kindness and caring nature toward everybody, especially her friends.  Yuuki's is from time to time fairly insecure due to her missing past so it may help to act this way but don't overdo it. If your going more for vampire Yuuki then don't act indecisive or insecure for that she looses this trait later. Also, be more authoritative. ,	Make or buy a Cross Academy day class or night class uniform (in the latest chapters, she finally got a night class uniform). Get the jewelry. Attain Yuuki's hair. Yuuki has an average-sized chest. Wear burgundy hued contact lenses if you don't have brown eyes. Have somebody cosplay as Zero or Kaname and hang around them. Be cheerful, kind, and act slightly air-headed. Smile and be nice to people. Be a little indecisive. Have a strong attachment with your close friends.  , Yuuki is super protective over Zero, so if you have someone you're extremely close to, exhibit protectiveness over this person.
Install motion-sensing lights by your driveway, garage, back door, and/or your front door. These lights will turn on when motion is detected, helping to deter approaching criminals. When choosing your lights, read the outside of the box to see what is involved in installing the lights. Install them per the instructions. It is recommended that you install passive infrared lights, low pressure sodium-vapor lights, or floodlights to deter criminals. You can purchase these at your local hardware store.; , Keep the trees and shrubs near your windows and doors trimmed. This will prevent burglars from being able to hide and launch an attack on your house., Place the decal next to the front door, or place it on a window facing the street. You can also place it next to your mailbox, or along the walkway leading up to your front door. Alarm decals will make criminals second guess their decision to break into your home.If you do not have an alarm decal, then display a “beware of dog” or community watch decal in your front yard instead.  Store bicycles, lawnmowers, snow blowers, and other expensive pieces of equipment in your garage or a locked shed. Also make sure to store your barbecue grill inside your garage, or somewhere in your backyard that is out of sight., Unless you are actively using it, make sure to keep your garage doors locked at all times. Do this even when you are inside the house, especially if your garage is attached to your house.If you have a shed, make sure to keep it locked as well.	Install motion-sensing lighting. Trim your trees and shrubs regularly. Place a home alarm system decal prominently. Store outdoor equipment out of sight. Keep your garage doors locked.
The materials needed are light and easy, though you may have some questions about how much you actually need:   About 2lbs of rope chord, cut into two roughly even halves (roughly 200 ft) 2-3 completely flat, 1/8" thick weaving shuttles, (various lengths) 1" thick wooden spacer, same length as chair 1/2" thick wooden spacer, same length as chair Very thin wooden spacer, same length as chair (a yardstick works well) Crochet hooks (for detailing); , You can start on any one of the four sides of the seat. Tie your knot and slide it all the way to one corner -- this is the starting point of your warp. A "warp" is simply the first round of rope, pointing in one direction, that gives the weave its shape.You should have the majority of your rope at the other end of this knot. Just keep it attached to the large ball of yarn/rope it came from. Click here to learn how to tie a clove hitch below.  This spacer will keep some slack in the weave as you start in the first direction. This will make it much, much easier to weave in the opposite side later. If you make this first weave too tight you will have to remove it and start over.  Take your rope and lay it over the spacer, over the opposite seat pole, then back underneath everything to your starting point. This is one loop.   You don't want to pull this as tight as possible. It should be tight enough to hold its shape, but not so tight you can't lift it slightly with your fingers.  Starting with the pole you tied the knot on, lay the rope over the spacer, over the opposite pole, then back under everything to where you started. Use your fingers to push the strings close together, then repeat until you have 5 total wraps.  Instead of wrapping across the whole width of the chair, wrap it the rope once around the pole opposite your starting side.  Come back to the beginning and wrap the rope just around this horizontal seat pole.  If you started on the left side of the seat, slide everything to the left. You should have a total of 6 parallel strings on the seat posts:   The string wrapped for your clove hitch. The five (5) strings woven across to the other side. The string wrapped around the pole to create a spacer.  This process simply continues until you've finished one side of the chair. To repeat:Wrap the string across the width of the chair, going over the spacer, around the far pole, and back to where you started. Repeat wrap for a total of five times. Wrap around each pole individually to create a spacer. Repeat., Don't try and tie a knot between two ends of the rope and keep going. If you're running out of rope/yarn/etc, simply finish the set of 5 you are on and create your two spacers. Tie the second spacer in, then create a clove hitch with a new strand of rope and "start over" from this point.  Once you get to the end of the seat pole, snip the rope so you have a 2-3" tail. Use your crochet hooks to tuck this strand into your warp, preventing it from unraveling, then snip any excess string., Shuttles are simply thin yarn holders that you can slide into your weave, making it much easier to get a tight weave than forcing your hands through the warp. Wrap up a small and a large shuttle, at minimum., Pick up the first five strings, and slide the spacer under it. Then slide the spacer on top of the next five strings, alternating so that you have a ladder-like pattern.  This time, your job will be easy as every other set is already being held up by the other spacer.   To get a little extra width, turn the spacers so that their widest side points upwards.  You'll be starting perpendicular to your first set of weaves, but it doesn't matter which side you start on.  You're doing the same thing as before, just keeping the string between your first set of weaves. This will help create the checkerboard pattern you're looking for.  Again, this is identical to the work from before -- you create another spacer on each side of the chair every five times you wrap around the width.  You should already see how the weave is forming small squares. As you work, you'll likely need to switch to smaller and smaller shuttles in order to fit under the weave, and you may have to switch to using just the thinner, 1/2" spacer or yardstick instead of both at once.   If you run out or rope, don't worry about tying another knot. Simply  , This takes time, but the precision is necessary for the final bits of the weave. Simply pull the rope through, using the crochet hook to get into the center and pull the rope up and down every five strings., Once you've finished the weave, it should hold strongly on its own. Your woven chair is done!, The weave goes perpendicular to the pole where you tie this knot., You should have a single strand of rope wrapped around your pole.  Make sure you do this loosely, so you could still get underneath the rope. You'll still have the rope wrapped around the pole, with crisscrossing ropes on top.  Again, come under and around the pole.  Basically, you're making another crisscross of the ropes but, this time, you need to go under the line. Note that this is under the second wrap you made, not the first one.  Hold onto the end of the rope, then pull hard on the rest of the line to tighten your knot.	Gather rope, shuttles, spacers, and a crochet hook, from a local craft store. Tie the first half of your rope to one of the horizontal seat poles using a clove hitch. Lay the 1" spacer across the seat, perpendicular to your knot. Wrap the rope around the whole width of the chair, then back to your starting point. Keeping the strings from overlapping, wrap the rope around everything four more times. After wrapping five times, individually wrap the seat pole to create a spacer. Run the rope to the other side and wrap the first seat pole once to create a second spacer. Slide the strings close together, making sure they don't crisscross. Repeat the process of five horizontal wraps and one spacer until you cover the whole chair. Tie a new clove hitch instead right after creating a spacer if you run out of rope and need to add more. Use a crochet hook to weave any stray strands back into the weave. Wrap the remainder of your rope onto your shuttles. Work your large spacer into warp, passing it over every other group of five strings. Turn the seat upside-down and repeat the step above with your other spacer, lifting the other sets of five strings. Starting with the rope on the larger shuttle, tie the rope down to a seat pole with another clove hitch. Using the shuttle to slide under the lifted strings, wrap the rope around the width of the chair five times. Wrap up the seat poles after five rounds to create spacers. Follow the same pattern as above -- five wraps, one spacer -- by sliding the shuttle underneath the lifted strings. Use the crochet hook to manually weave the final few strands, as the weave is likely too tight for the shuttles. Use scissors to clean up any loose threads, strands, and tails. Lay the end of the rope over the top of your pole (the edge of the seat). Pull the end under the pole and wrap it back around. Cross the end of the rope over the standing line wrapped around the pole. Tuck the end back under the pole as if double wrapping it. Slide the end underneath the loop you just made. Pull tightly on both ends of the rope to tighten it.
This collage is a good one after you've been hiking or walking in natural areas and you've collected things you found along the way. Suitable items include:   Seashells, broken and whole; carapaces of insects Flowers (these can be pressed and then used) Dried grasses Leaves Seeds and nuts, coconut shell ' straw, and others,etc.  If not, they may rot or go mildewy on the collage.  Paper, smooth bark, cardstock, recycled cardboard, etc. are all good choices for the background.  Perhaps you'd like to make a nature scene, such as arranging dried flowers as they'd appear in nature, or a clump of dried grasses. Or, maybe make a landscape or seascape using the items.  Use clear-drying craft glue. Double check that the items are actually sticking to the background.   If you want to preserve plant material used in a collage, make a "glaze". Dilute PVA glue with a little water. Brush this over the whole of the paper; this glazes the paper. Arrange the plant material on the glazed paper. Brush over all of the plant material with the same glaze. You must cover every possible bit of the plant material. Once fully dried, the glaze will protect the plant material for years and the effect will leave the collage shiny. Note that this can damage more delicate plant material, so be careful.  Place the collage on display or take photos of it and share online.	Find suitable items out in nature. Make sure that the items are dry before using them. Choose a suitable background. Design the collage. Glue the items in place. Allow to dry.
Also, you will need to consider the plant size as you may need to use multiple watering devices per potted plant or planted area.   Add up the number of potted plants versus in-ground plants that will need attention. If you need a self-watering device for in-ground plants, you may want to consider using a plastic instead of glass bottle for safety reasons.      ; , It’s very important to clean the hot sauce bottle thoroughly as you don’t want any spicy juice to get into the soil.   Pop off the top (the top that allows the hot sauce to slowly leak from the bottle) and fill the bottle with hot soapy water. Rinse and allow to dry.       Consider removing the bottle label so it doesn’t soak into the soil while the hot sauce bottle is doing its job.  If you want to feed your plants while they are being watered, add a small amount of plant food to the bottle first, then add the water. Replace the pop top lid and shake.  The bottle should be placed near enough to the plant so the water can seep down to the roots, but not so close so that it damages the plant.  Plunge the bottle into the soil, while at the same time removing your finger.	Identify plants that must be watered/cared for while you are away. Empty and clean out a hot sauce bottle. Fill the bottle with water. Identify an area near the plant to place the bottle. Turn the bottle upside down, while plugging the opening with your finger. Finished.
When you're growing a plant from a seed, it can help to germinate the seed first, because this will increase the chances of it taking root in the ground.   Place the seeds in a small bowl and fill it with warm water. Let the seeds sit in the water for 24 hours.After 24 hours, drain the water. On each seed, use your nail to gently pick away a small portion of the seed covering. Note that wisteria should be planted outdoors in the spring or fall, so make sure you start the germination process about six weeks before you want to transplant it outside.; , Fill a seed starter most of the way with potting soil and place one or two wisteria seeds on top of the soil in each pod. Make sure the seeds are on their sides. Cover them with one-quarter inch of potting soil.Place the seed trays in a warm, bright room. Add some water to the soil, and keep it moist for the duration of the sprouting time.  Keep the seeds warm and moist while they germinate, and give them lots of natural light. The seeds should sprout within 10 to 30 days.   Before you can transplant the sprouts, make sure they are at least four to five inches tall, and have a couple leaves on each stalk., A cutting is a root, leaf, shoot, or bud that gets trimmed off an established plant to propagate a new plant of the same kind. To do this, you will need an established wisteria plant to take the cutting from.If you don’t have an established plant to work with, ask friends or neighbors if they have a wisteria you can use.  For wisteria, you want to cut off a new shoot that still has soft green wood and that hasn’t yet developed bark. Make sure the shoot has a few sets of leaves on it (a couple on the top and a couple on the bottom).With a pair of sharp scissors or gardening snips, cut the shoot near the base. Make sure the cutting you take is about six inches long. You will have the highest chances of success if you do this at the end of spring or beginning of summer.  Snip off any leaves that are at the bottom of the cutting, leaving ones at the top intact. Then, snip off the bottom of the cutting at a 45-degree angle so there's only one-half inch (127 mm) of stem below the bottom leaf node that you cut. This will give the new roots somewhere to grow from and allow them to establish.For the best results, dip the end of the cutting into a rooting hormone before planting it., Place some rocks in the bottom of a small gardening pot to help with drainage. Fill the pot with potting soil that’s specifically designed for good drainage—look for a soil with a high perlite or coarse sand concentration. Add some water so the soil is moist. Make a two-inch (5 cm) deep hole in the soil with your finger and place the cutting in so the leaves are sticking up.Replace the soil and cover the bottom of the cutting where the roots will grow.  This will keep the soil moist and warm, and this will help the wisteria to take root. You can either wrap the entire pot in a plastic bag, or cover the top with a plastic bag or plastic wrap.Place the pot in an area where the plant will receive lots of indirect sunlight.  When the soil becomes dry to the touch, add water so it’s always moist. After about four to eight weeks, the cutting should take root.Since it’s best to plant wisteria in spring or fall, don’t plant the wisteria as soon as it begins to take root. Wait until fall to transplant it outside, or continue growing the new plant inside in pots until the following spring.  There are a few considerations when planting wisteria, including what the plant needs to survive and where it won’t cause damage. For instance:   The plant can grow quite large, so while it will grow nicely as a vine up a gazebo or pergola, this may not be a wise choice unless you're comfortable getting on a stepladder to prune the tree. Similarly, because wisteria is a climbing vine, avoid planting it near your house or any buildings, as eventually the plant can grow underneath siding, or ruin shutters and frames.Because wisteria grows so quickly and so heartily, plant it away from other plants, otherwise the wisteria might choke them out.Wisteria needs lots of sunlight to grow and bloom, so choose an area where the plant will get full sun exposure. The soil type doesn’t matter so much, but wisteria does need good drainage., The hole should be the depth of the roots and two to three times wider than the width of the roots.   If you're planting more than one wisteria, make sure the holes are at least 10 to 15 feet (3 to 5 m) apart., When the hole is ready, carefully remove the seedling from the starter pod by tipping it upside down with one hand and cupping the plant with the other.   When the roots slide out of the pod, gently place the plant roots down into the hole. Add enough soil and compost to cover the roots, then water the plant. Allow the water to drain, then fill up the hole with soil and compost.Use your hands to press down the soil around the plant, and give it some more water., Mulch will help keep the soil around the plant moist, which is good for wisteria.   Each spring, add a layer of compost and a layer of mulch on top of the soil where the wisteria is., Wisteria is a heavy plant, and without the proper support, it will collapse under its own weight in the wind. You will need to provide support in the form of stakes if you didn’t plant your wisteria near to a wall or structure that will support it.   When the wisteria plant has established itself, insert a wooden stake six to 12 inches into the ground about one-half inch away from the stalk. Using twine, attach the wisteria stalk to the stake every eight inches., This is especially important in the first year. Wisteria needs the equivalent of one inch of water each week, so if you aren't getting enough precipitation, you will need to water as well.   Even if you are getting enough rain, you should still give the wisteria a soaking once a week.	Germinate the seeds. Plant the seeds in a seed starter. Allow the seeds to sprout.

You can do some initial cleaning of your crystals with a toothbrush and water. Make sure you wash the crystals outdoors, as clay and dirt from the crystals can clog a sink.Scrub the crystal to remove set in clay. You will have to do several rounds of cleaning, allowing the crystals to dry in between rounds. Once the crystals dry, the clay cracks and becomes easier to remove. If clay is particularly stuck on, try spraying the crystals down with a hose with the nozzle set at maximum force. As with using a toothbrush, you will have to do this several times a day, allowing the crystals to dry in between sessions.; , Crystals may be stained with lime carbonates, calcite, and barite, causing discoloration. You can use vinegar and a household cleaner to remove these stains.Submerge the crystals in enough full-strength vinegar to cover all the crystals. Leave the crystals for 8 to 12 hours. Remove the crystals from the vinegar. Soak them in washing ammonium for an equal amount of time. Then, remove the crystals from the ammonium, rinse them completely, and wipe them dry. You may have to repeat this process several times if the stains persist after the crystals are first soaked.  There may still be some unwanted material on the quartz. You may also notice uneven edges. You can trim these materials using a diamond edged saw, which you can purchase at a local hardware store. Diamond edged saws can be expensive, however, so you may want to try borrowing the product from a friend or renting one.Lubricate the crystal with a light layer of mineral oil before you begin. There is no need to saw the crystal or press down on the saw. You simply need to place the crystal under the saw and allow the machine to gradually saw through the crystal. Trim away any unwanted portions of the crystal. There may be areas with stains that would not come out, for example, which you should remove with the saw.  The easiest and safest way to soak crystals to remove stains is using a combination of water and laundry detergent. You can then soak the crystals in bleach overnight. If your crystals have minimal stains, it's best to soak them overnight in a combination of water and household dish soap or laundry detergent.Use a combination of warm water and laundry detergent to wash the crystals. You can use a soft rag to scrub any dirt and debris that comes off easily. From here, find a container you can cover easily, like a sturdy Tupperware container. Fill this container with warm water and 1/4 cup of bleach. Place the gems in the bleach, cover the container, and set aside in a safe place for two days.  If your crystals have a lot of stains beyond regular dirt and grime, such as discolorations caused by iron, oxalic acid may be necessary to properly treat the gems. Oxalic acid is also known as wood bleach, and you can purchase it online or at a hardware store. Purchase a one pound bag of oxalic acid, and get a gallon container. Make sure the material the container is made out of will not corrode in response to acid. Metal containers cannot hold oxalic acid.Fill the container three fourths of the way full with distilled water. Then, pour in the oxalic acid. Wear an air mask to avoid inhaling the acid. You also want to make sure you work outside. Stir the acid, using a large rod or spoon, until the oxalic acid crystals are dissolved. Add the crystal quartz. There is no set time to soak quartz in oxalic acid. Depending on the staining, it can take a few days to a few hours. Check the quartz periodically and remove them when the stains are gone.  You need to take extreme precaution if you choose to handle oxalic acid. Only do so if your quartz are very stained. It is always safer to use bleach and water. If you choose to use oxalic acid, adhere to the following safety precautions:Wear eye protection, gloves, and a face mask when handling oxalic acid. Always pour acid into water. It is very dangerous to pour water into acid. Get a friend or family member to help you. Make sure to protect your work area and go slowly to avoid spills. Baking soda can neutralize acid spills, so have some baking soda on-hand.  Once you've soaked the crystals to remove the stains, you can now rinse the crystals. Make sure to use gloves for this process and, if you were working with oxalic acid, a face mask and eye protection. Wash away any excess bleach or acid with warm water. This should also help remove any remaining dirt., Once the crystals are clean and free of any stains, you should sand them down so they're soft and shiny. To do so, you'll need to gather certain materials. Stop by your local hardware store and pick up the following:50 grade sandpaper 150 grade sandpaper 300 to 600 grade sandpaper  , When sanding crystal, dust and powder may come off the gem. This can cause irritation of the nose, mouth, and eyes. Make sure you wear safety googles, gloves, and an air mask when polishing your quartz., To start, you'll want to use your mildest sandpaper. Gently work the sandpaper over the surface of the crystal.Make sure you go for consistency. You do not want any portions of the gem to be more or less sanded than others.  You'll want to work up to finer and finer grades of sand paper. Once you finish with the 50 grade sandpaper, rub the crystal down with 150 grade sandpaper. From there, move on to the 300 to 600 grade sand paper.Once again, rub the stone gently through its entire surface. Make sure to smooth away any blemishes or discolorations on the stone. When you're done, your crystal should like bright, clear, and shiny.  After sanding down the stone, you can use a soft cloth to give it an added gleam. Gently rub the stone clean with somewhat damp cloth. Get rid of any lingering dust from the sanding process, then set the stone aside to dry. You should have a clean, polished quartz crystal.	Use an old toothbrush to wash away clay or dirt. Soak the crystals in vinegar and washing ammonium to remove lime carbonates, calcite, and barite. Use a diamond edge saw to cut off excess material. Use water, household cleaners, and bleach. Try oxalic acid for harshly stained crystals. Be careful when handling acid. Rinse the crystals. Obtain the correct materials. Wear safety goggles, gloves, and an air mask. Work over the quartz with 50 grade sandpaper. Continue sanding the stone with 150 grade sandpaper, and then move on to the finest grade sand paper. Clean and rub the stone with a soft cloth.
If you only need a few buttons (less than 25) and you aren’t too worried about how professional they look, you can reuse old buttons. Find several in the size you want. They do not necessarily have to be the same size but if they aren’t, you’ll need to make different sized images.  You’ll need to create or otherwise get the image you intend to have on the button, sized correctly for the button diameter. Print out a sheet of these images on regular printer paper or photo paper if you’re feeling fancy.   Do test sheets on regular paper first, to make sure the image comes out the right size.  Cut out the image using sharp scissors, being as careful as you possibly can.  The best glue to use will be rubber cement. This is strong and creates a very flat appearance.	Find old buttons. Get your graphic. Cut out the image. Glue the image to the button.
Test gold with a magnet. Gold does not have magnetic properties. Test gold with a fine steel file. Gold is easy to file, but the file will bounce off of other metals. Purchase acids for testing. Follow the instructions on the package to test the gold for genuineness, testing in an inconspicuous spot to prevent visible damage.  You can find the daily market prices of gold on many brokerage websites.  You will need to purchase a jeweler’s scale that weighs gold according to pennyweight (1/12 of a troy ounce) rather than simply weighing gold in grams.  Many customers are happy to sell their gold jewelry and coins to a respectable dealer.  Many dealers at a trade show will give a price break to someone who is just getting started in the business.  Large volume purchases tend to have a lower price per ounce.	Learn to test the quality of gold. Follow market prices. Obtain a scale. Buy gold from customers. Purchase gold at trade shows. Purchase gold in large volumes.
If you’re under 18, you won’t be able to work as an actor without your parents’ permission, so it’s important to get them on board with your plans. Explain how much you enjoy acting, so they understand that it’s something you’re extremely passionate about. You may also need to reassure them that you won’t neglect your other responsibilities, such as school and chores, just because you’re pursuing acting.Don’t tell your parents that you want to become an actor just because you want to be famous or rich. Have some good reasons ready, such as you love telling stories or have fun creating characters, so they’ll take you seriously.; , While you may have natural talent, it always helps to hone your skills, so you’re well-prepared when you start to go on auditions. A school drama class is a good place to start, but specialized classes and workshops in specific acting areas, such as commercial acting or acting for the camera, are more impressive to list on your resume.If you don’t have time during the school year to take acting classes, a summer drama camp may be a good alternative. If you want personalized acting instruction, you might talk to your parents about hiring an acting coach who can work with you one-on-one to improve your skills.  While you probably won’t be able to get a professional acting job right out of the gate, you’ll want potential agents and casting directors to know that you have experience performing. Look for local opportunities to act (such as school plays, regional theater, and student films) so you have some roles to put on your resume.Try to play a large variety of types of roles. Doing so will it give you an opportunity to stretch your acting skills and will also showcase your impressive acting range to casting directors.  When you go to meet with potential agents and casting directors, you’ll need to provide a photo. They must be professional photos, though, so you should go to a photographer who specializes in taking photos of children and teens. Make sure to ask for both commercial and theatrical headshots, so you’re ready for both advertising work and film, television, and theater opportunities.It’s important to choose the right photographer for your headshots. Ask for recommendations if you have friends or acquaintances in the acting field. Otherwise, visit websites for photographers in your area, and study their online portfolios to get an idea of the quality of their work.  While you may be able to book some small acting jobs with just your parents’ help, having an agent is crucial if you really want to build a successful acting career. Not only will an agent know the ins and outs of the business so they can guide you in the right direction, they’ll have connections with casting directors and producers that make it easier to get auditions.To find an agent, research the top talent agencies in your area. You want to make sure that you’re working with a reputable agent, who doesn’t ask for any money upfront. Many talent agencies allow you to apply online. However, it’s a good idea to meet with a potential agent in person before you and your parents commit to working with them. If you live in a rural area where it's difficult to find an agent, that doesn't mean you can't act. It just means that you need to look for work through trade publications, such as Backstage, and online casting sites, so you can identify local acting opportunities. In some cases, agents won't take you on as a client until you have some professional acting credits to your name. You may want to find a few jobs on your own (or with your parents' help) before trying to land an agent.  If you’re under 18, many states require a permit to work in the entertainment industry. For example, California and New York, where many acting opportunities are available, have specific requirements that regulate how child actors may be used. Your agent should know the laws in your state, but you can also visit your state’s labor department website to find out if you need a permit in your state.In most cases, a form is required to get a work permit. You’ll need to provide parental consent, as well as other information depending on the state. Your health and school records are usually required.  While your agent will be on the lookout for acting opportunities that fit your skills, you can also do some research yourself. Sites such as Casting Frontier, Actors Access, and L.A. Casting provide casting and audition information for projects that are currently in the process of filling roles. You can usually submit yourself for consideration directly, but it’s a good idea to discuss potential roles with your agent.These sites usually charge a fee, so you’ll need to discuss joining them with your parents.  Whether you have an agent or not, it's important to find as many ways to market yourself as an actor as possible, especially if you don't live in L.A. or New York, where most acting opportunities are. Make videos for YouTube that demonstrate your acting skills -- there's no guarantee casting directors or agents will see your videos, but you never know when one will go viral.   Videos of school play and regional theater performances are ideal content for your YouTube channel. Local commercials or TV appearances are also a good idea because agents or casting directors outside your area probably haven't seen them. If you're feeling creative, you can also post original short films that help showcase your acting ability.  While most auditions will have a specific scene or group of scenes that you are required to perform, you may sometimes be asked to come up with your own material. That’s why it’s a good idea to work on a monologue or two, so you’ll always be ready when an audition comes up. Make sure to choose a piece that really allows you to showcase your acting skills.If you’re not sure what monologue(s) to prepare, consider some of your favorite movies -- there’s bound to be a piece in one of them that will work. It’s usually best to choose an age-appropriate monologue. If possible, find one that’s delivered by character who’s as close to you in age as possible.  In many cases, the casting company will send you a script or “sides,” which are just the portion of the script that pertain to the character that you’re reading for, in advance of the audition. Don’t just glance at your lines a couple of times to try memorize them -- make an effort to understand the character and figure out the best way to play the scene.Many casting directors won’t mind if you hold your script or sides during your audition. However, it’s best if you don’t read directly from it. Instead, just glance at it occasionally to remind yourself of the lines.  If you really want an acting career, you must take every audition seriously. While you may not have a job yet, you should act like a professional, so the casting director is comfortable working with you. That means being open to any suggestions that he or she might make and being willing to do the scene several times to get it right.Make sure to project confidence during your audition. If you don’t believe that you’re good enough for the part, the casting director probably won’t either.  Acting is an extremely competitive business, even for children. As a result, you’re probably going to go on many auditions that don’t end in a job -- but that doesn’t mean you should lose faith in your skills as an actor. As with most things, practice makes perfect, so the more you audition, the better you’ll become at impressing casting directors.If you realize at some point that you’re no longer having fun pursuing an acting career, talk to your parents. You shouldn’t keep at it if it only makes you feel bad about yourself.	Talk to your parents. Take acting classes. Get some experience. Get headshots. Find an agent. Get a work permit. Join online casting sites. Create a YouTube account. Prepare a monologue. Study the script or sides. Treat it like work. Don’t get discouraged.
The perfect size for an embroidery hoop is about 23 inches (58 cm) and the hoops can be found at any local store that sells crafts. Take the hoop apart and place its hardware pieces in a baggie to keep them from getting lost while you put the canopy together., Be sure that the casing seam at the top of your curtains are facing the hoop on its inside. Slide all six of the curtain panels around the circumference of the hoop., Clamp the two ends of the embroidery hoop together by inserting the hardware pieces you previously placed in the baggie. Slide curtains over the hoop’s closure and make sure that the curtains are distributed evenly around the circumference of the hoop., Cut three pieces of ribbon at about 4” long so that the hoop can hang a good distance away from the ceiling. If you want the canopy to hang down even lower from the ceiling, cut the ribbon pieces a little longer.Spread the curtains and loop the ribbons around the sides of the hoop. The ribbons should be looped onto the hoop every couple of panels so that the curtains are even on each side and the access points are more plainly seen.Tie the ribbons together at the top into a knot.  Hooks are available at most home improvement stores. Hang the knotted ribbon and your canopy curtains over the hook in the ceiling. Spread two of the panels to create a door.Add pillows to your finished canopy or stuffed animals to give the reading nook some personality. These reading nooks can also act as a tent around small arm chairs in children rooms and nurseries and can be the perfect place to read to your child while they’re in your lap.	Start crafting the canopy nook by taking apart the embroidery hoop. Slide the curtain fabric onto the embroidery hoop. Secure the hoop back together. Prepare the ribbons that will hang the canopy. Hang a hook from the ceiling and use it to hang the canopy on.
Pre-made trim comes in many different styles, colors, and shapes. Choose a trim that matches or compliments your upholstery. You can find pre-made trim at most hardware stores and craft stores.Some trim is accented with a piece of leather or cloth beneath the nails. This can be a great way of drawing a little more attention to your trim.  Use a pencil and a straightedge, like a ruler or meter stick, to draw an unbroken line where your nailhead trim will go. Be especially careful that this line is the same distance from the outside edge of the upholstery. This will help keep your trim straight.   When attaching your pre-made trim, you’ll only have to pound in nails every few inches (7 to 10 cm). The trim will cover your outline, hiding it from view., Attach your trim in sections to the outline. Do this by holding the trim in place over the line and pounding in nails to attach the trim where it has gaps. Continue this for the entire length of the outline.Your pre-made trim should have come with special nails that match or accentual the design of the trim. Use these for attaching the trim. If your pre-made trim didn’t come with nails, go to the hardware store to find nails that match your trim pattern. This way the nails used to attach the trim won’t look out of place.  Even slight deviations from your trim outline can leave your trim looking unsatisfactory. Step back and check for evenness. Adjust the trim where necessary by pulling out nails with a tack puller and reattaching the trim. Enjoy your nailhead trimmed furniture.When adjusting trim that is uneven, use fresh nails to reattach it. Nails that have been pulled out will be more likely to warp and need to be removed again, or they may deform, which can result in an undesirable appearance.	Select a suitable pre-made trim. Outline your trim placement on your upholstery. Install your trim along the trim outline. Check the straightness of your trim and enjoy.
A boat trailer has the added advantages of allowing you to boat on different bodies of water, to seize the random nice days in winter to fish or cruise and can save fees for winter boat storage. Be sure to check your vehicle owner's manual for safety rules, tips and complete instructions on boat towing capacity . This will help make sure you're selecting the appropriate boating equipment for the model you're buying.; , A typical rack storage facility keeps your boat in a covered shed filled with trailer-like cradles. Make a call to the facility a designated time before you want to go boating and they will use a forklift or other lifting machine to retrieve and launch your boat. When you come back, you tie it up, walk away and they return it to the shed.  You drive your family and gear to the marina, load the boat, cast off the lines and go. Rates vary from state to state and marina to marina, but typically you'll be charged according to the length of your boat or the length of the slip. Boat marinas often have showers and bathrooms and offer winter storage and service options. The best marinas offer connections for electricity, wash down water, telephone, Internet and TV at the dock. Boat marinas can be great fun as well, with slip-holders often getting together for parties, cookouts or just friendly socializing.  The slip becomes a long-term asset. This takes the annual guesswork out of the where-will-I-keep-my-boat equation in high-demand areas.	Consider Trailering:   You won't find a less-expensive way to keep a boat than storing it on a trailer in your driveway or backyard. See if Rack Storage is Available:   Another alternative for smaller boats is rack storage, or dry stacks. Contact The Boat Marina:   For owners of larger boats, and owners of small boats who crave convenience, a boat marina slip is the best way to go. Buy Your Slip:   In some locales, it's possible to actually buy a slip in a boat marina.
This will count as your first stitch. To make a slipknot, fold some yarn in half to make a loop in your non-dominant hand. Then, bring the tail end over the working end of the yarn so it crosses. Use the thumb and finger of your non-dominant hand to make a single loop, and poke your knitting needle through this loop. Gently tug on the yarn and yarn tail to tighten the knot.       ; , Push upward until you form a loop.  The tip of the needle should be pointing towards your thumb.  Make an upward motion with the needle as you do this.  Make the loop snug, but do not make it too tight.  Both the cast on loop and the slipknot should be the same size and tension. You may need to tighten or loosen the knots to do this.  Each cast on equals one stitch. The slipknot also counts as one stitch.          Try not to make knots too tight, or you won't be able to knit into them later.	Make a slipknot and slide it onto your knitting needle. Hold the needle in your hand and wrap the yarn around your thumb from behind the working yarn. Bring the needle in front of your thumb and the strand of yarn. Slip the needle under the yarn around your thumb. Pull your thumb out and tug on both strands of yarn. Push the loop down towards the slipknot, and adjust if necessary. Keep repeating the steps until you have the number of stitches the pattern requires.
As the date of Earth Day roughly coincides with U.S. Arbor Day, planting trees is a popular Earth Day activity. Trees helps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, clean pollution, secure soil in place to prevent erosion, and provide homes for many birds, insects and other animals. There's almost no more important, long-lasting act you can do to celebrate Earth Day.   Pick a tree that you know can survive in your climate. It's best to find a species native to where you live. If you're unsure about what that might be, ask an employee at your local garden shop, or inside the garden department of a big-box store. To ensure that the tree grows tall and strong, make sure you plant it correctly. Choose the correct planting spot to meet its needs, dig a properly-sized hole, and water the tree well to give it a good start.  Choose flowers that are native to your area and plant them in your garden or on nature strips where plants are usually grown. Restoring the local plant life will help attract native bird life, pollinators and local mammals. Here are a few examples of common flowers that will draw wildlife:   If you want to attract Monarch butterflies, plant milkweed, pansies or goldenrod.If you want to attract bees, plant bee balm, lavender or sage. If you want to attract hummingbirds, plant foxglove, petunias or lilies., You can do a lot for the creatures of the earth starting in your own yard or neighborhood. In their quest for the perfect lawn, many people drive out the insects, rodents, birds and reptiles that need a place to call home just as much as we do. Starting on Earth Day, why not welcome these nonhuman neighbors into your yard? Here's how to do it.   Instead of mowing the entire yard, leave a few sections unmowed. Bees, butterflies, and many other insects will find this inviting. If you're worried about them coming inside, have the unmowed area in the back of the yard instead of right next to the house. Install a bird feeder, bat feeder, squirrel feeder, hummingbird feeder, or any other type of feeder to attract more wild animals. Provide a source of water, like a bird bath or a small pond. Don't try to get rid of snakes, lizards, frogs, moles, squirrels, and the other creatures who want to hang out in your yard. Many of these animals are beneficial; they aerate your yard, eat mosquitoes and improve biodiversity in the area. Live and let live. Tell your neighbors to do the same!  , Pesticides and herbicides can harm wild animals, native plants, trees, pets, and even humans. Make Earth Day the day you stop using chemicals in your yard and try organic methods of weed and pest removal instead. Consider talking to your neighbors about making the whole neighborhood organic.   Getting rid of pests the old-fashioned way can actually be more effective than using pesticides. Try planting native plants to control the insect population. Use water to spray common insects like aphids off of your vegetable plants. When it comes to weeds, pulling them out by hand works better than any other method.  Whether you live near an ocean, river, forest, mountain, swamp or lake, wild areas like these need protection. They are home to many plants and animals who rely on them for food and shelter. On Earth Day, commit to protecting the wild places in your community by doing the following:   Join a group working to protect these areas from pollution and developments. Encourage people to respect wild spaces by not damaging animal habitats, littering, and dumping in the water.  Many groups use the weekend of Earth Day to clear roadways, highways and neighborhood streets of litter that has accumulated since the last clean-up day.Many companies donate gloves and bags for clean-up groups and villages organize bag pick ups. Once the group has collected the trash and placed the recycled bags along the road, get the village public works department to pick the bags up. It's a wonderful community project that you can do as an individual or with a group.	Plant trees. Plant wildflowers. Welcome animals into your yard. Talk to your neighbors about going organic. Commit to protecting local wild places. Clean up litter in your community.
You will want sturdy shoes for street dancing.   Well made sneakers or high top hip hop shoes will work very well for street dancing. Try to avoid wearing old, beat up shoes. The style of sneakers you wear doesn't matter as much, but it is important that they are sturdy and comfortable. Try to get a pair of high-quality shoes made from strong canvas or leather, with a strong support sole.; , You don't want to just start dancing without warming up. This can lead to an injury.Try skipping, jogging in place, or jumping rope to warm up your muscles and increase your heart rate. Try gentle stretches of the major muscle groups, holding them for 10-15 seconds each. Steady - rhythmic activity will also prepare you for dancing.  Street dance is all about music that has a strong beat.Hip hop or rap music is traditionally used for street dancing. You want to avoid anything slow. Keep the music vibrant and up tempo. Feel the beat of the music and use it to help you move to the music.	Choose the right footwear. Get warmed up. Choose some music.
For large areas, rent or buy a lawn spreader or a mechanical seeder, which shoots grass seed evenly across the lawn. For small areas, spread grass seeds by hand.   Use the amount of seed recommended by the lawn care expert at your home and garden store. It is important to use the correct amount of grass seeds to ensure your lawn grows evenly. Do not overseed your lawn. Do not use up extra seed by spreading it over the lawn. Overseeded areas will grow thin, unhealthy grass, because seedlings will compete for limited nutrients.  Newly planted seeds need to be protected from the elements until they take root. A thin layer of topsoil will help, but it's best to use a loose layer of mulch to help retain moisture.You can distribute this by hand or with a cage roller.   Yellow grain straw is a popular choice, since it's cheap and easily broken up by the mower once your lawn is established. Avoid hay, which has too many seeds, and fresh pine straw, which slows grass growth. (Aged pine straw is fine.)Other forms of mulch will also work, but apply dense materials such as compost or sawdust in layers no thicker than ¼" (6 mm)., Set your garden hose head to the "mist" setting and lightly water the seeds until it is thoroughly damp. For a larger lawn, run a sprinkler in the center of the area for a few minutes.   Don't use a powerful stream of water, or you will wash away the grass seeds. Newly planted seeds should be watered lightly every other day until the grass sprouts., Protect the newly planted seeds from trampling for the first few weeks. Consider putting up a sign or using a string or flags to cordon the area. If pets and other animals run loose, consider putting a temporary fence to protect the lawn from harm.	Scatter the seed. Protect seeds with topsoil or mulch. Water the seeds. Keep people and pets off the new lawn.
If dirt has sunk to the bottom of the reservoir, remove the reservoir from the car and clean it well inside. Reconnect the necessary wires and hoses when reinstalling the reservoir.; , Replace any faulty hoses.    Mix a washer fluid solution according to the fluid product. Fill the pump's reservoir to the necessary level with the solution. Use a funnel to help you. Use a formulated, non-freezing washer fluid in the wintertime.  Use a long pin or fine wire to pick out or poke through clogged dirt. Follow by rinsing the parts that are exposed with water.  Ask them to activate the washer system to send out fluid. Let the washer fluid solution flush the system of remaining dirt or deposits.   Detach hoses one at a time to make sure that washer fluid is exiting through them. If hoses are clean or new but fluid is not reaching them, the cause could be an electrical problem.  Rather than having to remove the washer fluid reservoir from the car to clean out dirt, etc., try filling it with water. Then siphon it out. Do this several times until the water comes out clean. It works a treat and will save you the job of trying to extract a rather difficult-to-access reservoir.  They should squirt fluid above the windshield's center. Adjust them if necessary.   Washer nozzles may be found on the windshield wiper arms. The nozzles could also be on the car's hood panel and aimed separately at the windshield. Other nozzle configurations are having one nozzle for the left and right sides of the car or having adjustable offset nozzles arranged on a base. Washer nozzles on wiper arms should not need adjusting because they are already centered and move with the arms. Individual nozzles may be adjusted by moving a tab connected to each nozzle by hand. If no tabs are present, gently adjust the nozzles with pliers. Adjust fixed nozzles by loosening a retaining nut for the entire nozzle body. Find the nut under the car's hood. Turn the nozzle so it sprays as much of the windshield as possible. Hold the nozzle in place and tighten the nut. Nozzles that can be adjusted in their body can be aimed properly with a screwdriver, wrench, or pliers. If the tools cannot grab onto the nozzle, insert a thin needle or wire into the nozzle's opening. Move the nozzle in the direction you want, but do not force it or your wire or needle could break and get lodged in the nozzle.    Turn off the car's power. Look for the pump on or in your washer fluid reservoir. It may also be attached to your windshield wiper's motor. Unplug the washer pump's electrical connector. Turn the ignition back on. Have someone else activate the washer and keep it on. Use a test light to see if the pump is receiving power. You can also listen for a humming sound and feel for a vibration from the pump to see if it is powered. If it is not getting power, check for a blown fuse. Access your car's fuse box, find the fuse for your washer pump, and replace it if necessary. You may need to take your car to a professional mechanic or auto shop to fix wiring or electrical problems, especially if the washer is activated by a button on the car's steering-column. If the pump does receive power but still does not send out fluid, it may need replacing. Take the pump out from its location and replace it with a new one. You will also want to replace the seal that the pump goes through into the tank.	Check the washer fluid reservoir for dirt. Look for cracks, leaks, or breaks in the plastic or rubber hoses connected to the washer reservoir. Add more washer fluid if necessary. Unclog dirt from nozzles, hoses or screens. Have someone else turn on your car's ignition. Try an alternative cleaning method. Check the aim of your washer nozzles. Check your washer pump's power if the fluid is still not appearing when activated.
The goal is to find a doormat that has no texture but an easy surface to hold the stones. Look for something with a sturdy backing as the stones will be heavy and you don’t want them to fall when moving the mat.   Measure the size you desire and then mark with the pencil. If you are satisfied with the size, you don’t need to cut the mat.; , Before adding a drop of glue you’ll need to position the stones so that they cover the mat.   Make sure they work cohesively on the mat, fitting together like a puzzle. Check to ensure no spaces are between stones or that you can see the mat. Design the mat to create a shape that closely resembles the mat shape you cut.  Without disturbing the layout add a layer of glue to the back of each stone and press into place.   Work slowly so that you don’t disturb the other stones in the layout that haven’t been glued into place.  Consider using a piece of board to slide underneath the mat to make moving it into place a smooth transition.   Use caution because although the stones are held by strong glue, they can still shift in transition so either use a hard surface to move the mat and/or slide it into place.	Cut doormat to size. Lay out stones on doormat. Add glue to the back of each stone. Allow for at least 24 hours of dry time before moving mat into place.
It could be singing, dancing, or playing an instrument. Make sure that the act you are doing showcases your talents. If you are doing anything involving music, make sure the music lyrics are compliant with your school's code.; , If your act is too hard or a part of it is difficult, edit that part out, redo it, or find something different to do.  Relax. Just go into the room and do your thing! Remember to say "Thank you" when you are done. You will find out later if you got in. If you did, congratulate yourself! If you didn't, ask the judges what fault they found in your performance so you know what to look out for next time!  ,, This is your time to mess up. Try on your outfit and makeup to see how it looks, and ask others. Accept advice or criticism when given.	Think of something that you do well that would fit into a talent show. Practice to make sure you have your act all ready the day you try out. Sign up and try out. Select the clothes you want to wear during the performance and makeup suitable for your act, if any.  , Practice in front of family and friends.
Wash the vase with soap and water, then pat it dry with a soft, clean towel. Wipe the entire vase down using rubbing alcohol. This will get rid of any oils that might prevent the paint from sticking., You do not have to cover the entire vase with painter's tape. Instead, wrap some painter's tape around your vase, just above where you want the gold to end. You will paint everything below that line., Run a credit card over the tape. This ensures that the edges are firmly sealed against the glass. It will help prevent the paint from seeping under it., Shake the paint bottle well, the pour a small amount onto a plate. Use a foam brush to pick up the paint, then dab on a thin layer onto the glass. Don't worry if it looks sheer.Apply the paint going in the same direction, ie: up-and-down. If you can't find any gold leaf paint, try gold enamel paint instead. It will give you a similar look., It's very important that you wait, or the paint may not cure properly. Once the two hours are up, apply another light coat of paint.Apply the paint going in the opposite direction, ie: left-and-right. If the paint still looks sheer after this, let the paint dry another two hours, then add a third coat., How long it takes for the paint to dry depends on the type of paint you are using. In most cases, it will take about 24 hours.Refer to your bottle of paint for specific drying times.  You can peel the tape away after 2 to 3 hours., If you have not yet done so, carefully peel the tape away. Your lines should be crisp and neat. If there are any chips, fill them in using a thin brush and gold leaf paint. You can also use a gold leaf pen instead.	Clean the vase. Mask off the areas you don't want painted with painter's tape. Seal the tape in. Start applying gold paint to the vase with a foam sponge. Let the paint dry two hours before applying another coat. Let the paint dry completely. Carefully remove the tape.
If an older friend or sibling is willing to buy you a ticket but the theater still won’t allow accompanied children into the movie, have your friend or sibling buy a ticket for themselves. Ask them to head inside to have their ticket torn by staff. After they sit in the theater for a few minutes, have them leave the theater and find you outside so they can give you the torn ticket stub, which you can then show the staff inside for “re-entry,” as if you had already gone in but then ran back out to take care of something outside.Scope out the staff ahead of time. See if they make a point of inspecting ticket stubs when people reenter, or if they just let people in when a ticket stub is shown at all. If they let people breeze by, you could possibly try using an old stub that you’ve saved from a previous movie.Use this trick at a multiplex with multiple ticket collectors. Avoid theaters that only assign one staff member for this job, since they may have a good memory for faces and thus know who has and hasn’t presented a ticket already.Wait for the line to back up, since staff will be more likely to wave stub-holders through while dealing with tickets that still need to be torn.  Pick a movie that you’re allowed to see. Choose one that starts a little before the one you intend to see. Give yourself time to switch theaters without missing the beginning of the movie you want to see.   If your multiplex has ticket collectors at the door to the theater that you want to sneak into, go watch the movie that you just bought a ticket for. Wait for the movie that you want to see to start playing. Leave the first theater and, if the ticket collectors are gone, sneak into the second. If they’re still there, go the restroom or concession stand as if that’s all you meant to do, and then try again in a little bit later. If your multiplex collects tickets at the front of the house and then lets you find your own way, just say thanks and sail right into the theater you want to go to once you find it.Use this trick at multiplexes rather than small, two-screen theaters, since you’re more likely to attract attention at the latter due to the lack of space.  Wait for a movie to let out. Go to a large multiplex, since these often have extra exits located throughout the building. Since these doors are exit-only,wait for a movie to let out, when a crowd will most likely exit all at once through these doors. Join the crowd as it spills out and act like you’re part of it. Then pretend you’ve left something inside. Head inside as though you’re going back in to find what you’ve supposedly lost.   Get your timing right. Avoid loitering outside the doors, since there may be security cameras. Search online ahead of time to find out what movies in which theaters are letting out when. This way you’ll know exactly when to be in place. Don’t go in as a group. Be believable; one kid running back inside to find something he’s lost is plausible, but a bunch of kids doing the same looks like a bunch of kids sneaking into a theater. If you’re going as a group, have only one person go inside while the others wait for him to come back, which adds credibility to your cover. Once the crowd disperses, have the inside man come back and reopen the door for the rest of the group. Be aware that this is technically theft.If you’re caught, you may be in more serious trouble than you would be if you tried to buy a ticket for a movie that’s not meant for you.  Have them purchase a ticket for any movie and enter through the front. Wait outside an exit-only door. Once the coast is clear inside, have them open the door for you.Know the layout. Keep an eye out for security cameras that may catch you loitering outside or opening the door from the inside. Be careful not to use a fire exit that triggers an alarm when opened. Remember, this is technically theft, so you may get in trouble for this.  Some theaters screen movies privately for staff after closing-time the night before a premiere. Since these screening are informal, ask anyone you know who works there if you can tag along.	Use a ticket stub. Buy a ticket for another film. Sneak into the theater. Have an inside man let you in. Go to a private screening.
This may be a subtle theme or the entire base of your room. Most room decorating articles say this, but it is quite important, otherwise your room will look random and untidy. If your walls are non-paint-able you may wish to add a large, coloured pin-board to your room. If you're lucky, your room came with one of these, but they are relatively easy to make and a savior when it comes to colour themes.; , You really should start over as new as possible. This means deciding what you don't need anymore, and what you can tidy away into your cupboard. Don't go too overboard though. You don't want to throw away things that you may want or need in the future. Create a storage space in your cupboard and hide away the things that don't suite your rooms desired look.  Look over your room: the colour of the walls, ceiling and carpet, the window frames, the colour of the doors... everything matters. Usually most of the above are a white or creamy colour, which can be good or bad (you decide). Also look at the position of the windows in your room, and how much natural light is let in. This overview of your room will give you and idea of what extra furniture or decorations you will need.   If your room is small and doesn't get much light, consider it more of a "night-time room". If your room is airy and gets a lot of sun, it is most probably a "day-time room". Some rooms are lucky enough to be both. Examples of this are rooms with slanting ceilings, skylights, or attic rooms. Although it may seem annoying, these rooms can look wonderful with the right decoration.  Put all the small things in a pile outside your room (books, reading lamps, tissue boxes), leaving the big things (like beds, dressers or bookshelves) in your room. This way you will be able you move your furniture into the position you want it in freely. Once you have done this you will be able to bring in the necessities, like the lamp and the books for the shelf, leaving the decorations till last.  Maybe you decided your room is a night-time room, so you got some fairy-lights. If it is a day-time room, you may have bought a couple of bean bags and made some tissue-paper fairy balls. Whatever it is, leave the decorating till last. If you don't you may later realize that that space is needed for something more important.	Decide on a colour theme. Tidy up!, Go with what you've got. Shuffle your things around. Decorate!
While it’s still running, watch the toilet for any signs of a rise in water level or bubbling in the water, these could indicate a blockage.; , When it gets to the point in the cycle that the water drains from the machine, inspect close by drains for water backing up into things like showers bath and basins  , If it has either risen or lowered, then there could be a blockage stopping the water flowing as freely as it should.  The water should go down the drain in a swirling motion when the tap is at its fastest water flow speed. If the basin is slowly filling up, then you have some form of blockage.  This indicates water flow issues, and therefore a blockage.  Bad odors can indicate that there is debris in your drain rotting and causing a blockage.	Turn on the tap in the bathroom and let the water run for about 1 minute. Do a load of washing in your washing machine. Flush the toilet and inspect the water level before and after flushing. Check all sinks and bathtubs for drainage speed. Listen for gurgling sounds when the basins and sinks are draining. Smell for odors around your sinks and showers.
Water pooled outside the refrigerator might be caused by a dirty drain pan. Your drain pan should be cleaned about once a year. Water pooled inside the refrigerator might be caused by a clogged drain tube. Clean out a clogged drain tube by forcing a solution of water and baking soda or bleach through the tube with a basting syringe.   The refrigerator should be turned off before attempting to clean the drain pan and tube.  If your refrigerator is not level, things might not seal correctly, and the defrost drain might leak. The refrigerator was designed to operate correctly when level. Unplug the refrigerator, then place a level on top of the refrigerator. Check the back and front of the appliance and adjust the feet until it is level throughout., If the water filter is not fitted properly, water may leak out. After unplugging your refrigerator, remove and reinstall the water filter. Also check for cracks in the water filter head and housing. If there are damages, your filter head or housing will need to be replaced.	Check the drain pan and tube. Level the refrigerator. Check the water filter.
Every living arrangement has its benefits and drawbacks, and in order for it to work, the benefits must be recognized and outweigh the drawbacks. When the going gets tough, remembering why you've chosen to live in a multigenerational household will help to cope with any conflicts that may arise. Some of the reasons families choose to live together are:   Money. Loss of a job or unexpected expenses, like divorce or death in the family. A big move, where one family unit lives with another family unit or member who is already in the area until they can become familiar with the area and establish their own home. A desire to live in an area with high costs. By having more family members live in a single house, the family can afford a nicer, larger house in a better neighborhood and with better schools. Working parents who prefer to have their own family members care for their children instead of strangers. Elderly relatives who need to be looked after by family instead of home care services. An emphasis on preserving religious beliefs and customs. Unexpected circumstances, such as a debilitating injury, heart problems, or an incurable disease. An extended family living situation can provide a helpful cushion if and when such circumstances arise.; , If it's a temporary situation, let your family know what your situation is.    Does anyone in the family have health issues that need to be addressed, such as an elderly parent needing special care, or a child with learning disabilities? If their care is home based, which of the other family members are primarily responsible for this care?  ,   Address your concerns about privacy. It can be hard to have privacy in this living situation. Make sure everyone understands the importance of privacy, and have consequences for anyone who invades anyone's privacy in any way, whether it's the Internet, your diary, going through personal belongings, and even listening in on phone calls. Part of maintaining boundaries is each member of the family knowing that giving advice, especially when it comes to problems or arguments by a married couple within the house, should only be given "if asked for." Never get into the middle of a couple's argument unless it's a case of abuse. Set physical boundaries. Some people have more "physical" personalities than others. Let your family know about your concerns about physical violence and/or inappropriate touching. Set acoustic boundaries. It's likely that at least one person in the house will enjoy hearing loud music or even television. Tell those who want loud music or television to use headphones. Set bathroom rules. Some people are more accepting about using the bathroom at the same time than others. Have locks on the bathroom doors to prevent accidental interruptions and embarrassments.  If the adults do not remain mindful of each other's rights and responsibilities, homework can sometimes be a source of discord in the house. What causes problems is a non-parent adult's sense of how far they should be allowed to go in deciding what is best for children. It's especially important for tell your parents and grandparents, as well as other family members not to counteract the rules you've set for your own children .  Of course, there are times when the unforeseen happens. If all the adult members work together, most problems can be resolved.  If it is a more personal problem, take the other family member aside and discuss it quietly. As mentioned earlier, there should be a time and a place where any family member can have privacy. It is under those circumstances that many personal problems can be addressed and resolved before they erupt into a major conflict.    Have one day and/or night a week of fun for everyone.	Know WHY this arrangement is in place. Discuss the the different circumstances with your family so that everyone is on the same page as to why you are living together. Define the responsibilities surrounding those who need to be cared for. Discuss boundaries as a group, as they must be respected by each household member, from the youngest to the eldest. Let parents raise their own children. Decide ahead of time who will be responsible for paying bills, and stick to this to the best of your ability. Call a family meeting if there is a problem you think needs discussing. Spend quality time together as a family.
The thread should be fine and strong; silk or cotton are good natural choices while polyester thread is long-lasting.Place the needle and thread on the underside of the fabric where you intend sewing the sequin into place.   Match the thread to the color of the sequin rather than to the fabric.; ,, Draw it through the center of the sequin. Leave a long tail of thread on the underside.  Cross the thread over the top of the sequin. , The more that you sew, the faster this will become as you get used to the rhythm of going through the motions.   When sewing sequins in a row, be sure that they're not overlapping unless this is the final look you wish to achieve.	Begin with fine, long needle and suitable thread. Place the sequin with care on the top side of the fabric, sitting in the position that you want it to be.  , Bring the needle up through the fabric. Return to the backside of the fabric. Tie the ends of the thread together on the back side to create secure knot.  , Move on to the next sequin.
Putting off going to visit a loved one in the hospital is always a mistake, as is waiting until the last days before a friend leaves the country forever. Don't miss out on your chance to say goodbye and brighten their final moments. Alone in the hospital can be a terrible place to die. Be in the room and say what needs to be said. Spend as much time with your loved one as possible. Be with him or her and support them.   Often, the dying want and are very comforted by one of four very particular messages: "I love you," "I forgive you," "Please forgive me," or "Thank you." If any of these seem appropriate, take care to include them in your goodbye., We often have the impression that death or other "forever" goodbyes are supposed to be a somber and joyless thing. But follow the lead of the person leaving. Your role is to be there for them and to comfort them in a time of need. If laughter is desired, or seems natural, then laugh.  It can be hard to know how honest to be with the dying. If you're visiting an ex-spouse or an estranged sibling, there can be lots of tension burbling under the surface, and complicated emotions at work in their passing. The hospital doesn't seem like the best time to let loose and tell off your father for being absent.   If you feel like the truth will hurt the person dying, recognize this and change the subject. Say, "You don't need to worry about me today" and change the subject. It can be tempting to want to be overly optimistic, saying "No, there's still a chance. Don't give up" if a loved one says, "I'm dying." There's no need to dwell on something neither of you know for sure. Change the subject to, "How are you feeling today?" or reassure them by saying, "You look great today."  , Always speak gently and identify yourself as the person speaking. Even if you're not sure you're being heard, say what needs to be said. The goodbye process in death works both ways--make sure you don't regret not saying "I love you" one last time. Even if you're unsure if the person can hear you, say it, and you'll know., Both physically and emotionally, be in the room. It can be difficult to avoid becoming hyperaware of the significance of the moment: "Is that the last time he'll say, 'I love you'?" Every moment can feel tense and electric. But get out of your own way and try, as much as possible, to experience the moments for what they are: time with a loved one.   Often, the dying have a great amount of control over the actual moment of their death and will wait until they're alone to save their loved ones the pain of experiencing it. Likewise, many family members are committed to being there, "To the end." Be aware of this and try not to put too much emphasis on the exact moment of death. Say goodbye when it seems appropriate.	Say goodbye now. Do what feels appropriate. Tell the truth, selectively. Keep talking. Be present.
Cranberries ripen in the fall. You can tell when they begin to ripen because they will change from green to bright red in color. This happens at the beginning of September and generally ends in mid-November. Cranberries that are dry harvested are less likely to get damaged than wet harvested berries. Dry harvested berries are the ones sold fresh at markets and stores.   Be sure to harvest by the first frost of the year for good quality berries.; , Dry harvesting of cranberries cannot be executed if there is any moisture on the plant. This includes rain, dampness from a frost or even dew. If there is any sign of wetness on the plants, hold off harvesting until things dry out., Similar in workings to a large, push lawn mower, the picker mows over the field. It has moving comb-like fingers that separate the berries from their vine. The berries are then shifted into an attached container, like a grass catcher. The berries in the container are then collected and sent to be processed. The one downside to the mechanical picker is that the machine can occasionally damage berries. Damaged berries are best used for juices and sauces.  If you are not growing many cranberry bushes, you could consider picking your cranberries by hand. While this takes a good deal of time, it is a more affordable way to pick the berries. Picking by hand is not recommended if you have a cranberry bog. Invest in a mechanical picker, which you can order online or through your local yard supply store. You can also rent or borrow a mechanical picker before you buy to decide if you want to make the investment. You can also use a handheld scoop if you only have a few bushes. This is much more cost effective for a few bushes than a mechanical picker., The reason that there are two ways to pick cranberries (dry or wet) is because cranberries grow in bogs. What a lot of people don’t know is that bogs are not always wet, thus farmers are able to dry harvest the berries. The other harvesting option is to flood the bogs with water. Cranberries float, so when the bogs are flooded, detached berries from the stems and float to the top of the water, where they are able to be scooped up., The harvest begins a day before the farmer actually collects the berries as he pumps water into the cranberry fields. The amount of water can range from six up to about 18 inches (45.7 cm). These bogs are impermeable--specifically created with layers of various growing mediums--so flooding them is not difficult.   However, keep in mind that flooding harvest requires that you prepare the ground before you flood it. It is also only worth doing if you have many bushes. If you only have a few, then picking by hand is your best bet.  Machines, fondly called 'egg beaters' are used to agitate the waters. This process separates the cranberries from their vines. Because cranberries grow with a little pocket of air inside them, they float. All loosened berries come to the surface of the water., A net is stretched from one end of the bog to the other. It is walked across the field and gathers the berries as it moves. Instead of a net, sometimes a machine like the boom of a boat is used to gather the berries.  Cranberries are then vacuumed up and into trucks to be shipped out to a processing plant. These berries arrive to consumers in some kind of processed form--either juice, sauce or other processed foods. Wet harvesting does more damage to the berries than dry harvesting, which is why these berries are made into sauces, juices or jellies., One of the best ways to do this is to look at the color of the berries. Depending on where your berries grow, their colors can range from light, but vibrant, red to a very dark crimson color. They should also be firm to the touch. These berries are the ones that make it into the fresh produce section of your grocery store. They are best used for cooking and baking., While this may sound strange, a great way to sort the best berries from the not as great ones is to bounce them. Quality berries are firm and springy--meaning they bounce off the ground nicely. They bounce because of the air bubbles inside the berries. Don’t throw them as hard as you can at the floor, but a simple drop against a flat surface should be enough to tell you whether or not your berries have the bounce.  You can either use the fresh ones in a recipe, or freeze them for later use. You might also consider drying some of the cranberries for a delicious snack.   Fresh, bouncy cranberries will last for up to two months in the refrigerator.	Know the right time of year to pick cranberries. Choose a dry day. Walk a mechanical picker through the fields. Know that cranberries grow in bogs. Flood the bogs. Stir the waters. Collect the berries. Pick up the cranberries. Sort the berries for qualities. Bounce the berries. Keep the bouncy berries and discard the rest.
You need a party hat that is made from lightweight cardboard to make a unicorn horn. You can find them at your local party store and some grocery stores.  Find out where the hat is connected, and undo it so you can roll it out flat. If the party hat is taped, remove the tape or gently cut the tape to undo it. If the hat is glued together, carefully use scissors to separate it. Then, unroll the party hat out flat.         Keep the elastic attached to the hat  , To make the horn, you need to roll the hat up again, but roll it tighter than it was before. Start with one side of the party hat, and roll it towards the other side creating a tighter roll. Keep rolling until you have a nice tight cone shape.  Use tape to secure the hat into the horn shape. Use a hot glue gun, or put several pieces of tape on the outer edge of the party hat to secure it to the hat.  Put the base of the horn on top of your forehead and pull the elastic over the back of your head to wear your new unicorn horn.	Get a party hat. Undo the party hat. Roll the hat tighter. Tape the hat together. Wear your new unicorn horn.
Before brainstorming for ideas, you need to design a budget. After designing a budget, you'll know the exact resources you have to create your dining room.   Start with savings or other money you've set aside for your dining room. Allocate money for painting, flooring, and other structural elements. It might be best to get estimates from several contractors for these costs. Determine how much money you have for major pieces of furniture. This includes your table, chairs, and buffet. Figure out how much money you want to reserve for accessories like artwork, plants, or rugs.; , Spend time browsing a variety of media in order to get ideas about how you'll plan your dining room. Without looking at how others have designed inviting dining rooms, you won't be equipped to prepare your own. Consult:   Furniture catalogs. Home improvement magazines. Consider magazines like "Better Homes and Gardens," "Martha Stewart Living," or "Good House Keeping." Websites. Try websites associated with popular magazines or TV channels like HG TV.  The style of a dining room is largely responsible for the feel of the overall room. Thus, you need to make sure you are conscious of the style you are choosing when you design your dining room. If you’re not, your room may clash or send mixed signals to guests.   Consider styles such as neoclassical, Tudor, art deco, French countryside, or shabby sheik. Your style may or may not reflect the overall style of your home. If you choose a clashing style, make sure to clash responsibly and do so deliberately. For instance, you may choose to stick an art deco serving table into a room decorated with a Tudor style., As the centerpiece of your dining room, your table will set the tone for the whole room. If you choose an inappropriate table, you’ll inadvertently set a tone that you don’t want.   Your table should be an appropriate size for your room. You should have at least 36 inches (91 cm) between your table and the wall (or furniture). Ideally, you should have 48 inches (123 cm) between the two. Think about whether you want an expandable table with leaves. Consider the style of your table and whether it will match other accent furniture. Major styles include traditional (with many ornate details), contemporary style (relatively simple), transitional (some ornate details but relatively simple), and the country style (these might appear shabby chic or distressed). Determine the material you want your table made from. While some people prefer a traditional wood, others might want a upscale mahogany, and some people may want a modern-looking glass or metal table. Think about whether the table will age well. Ultimately, a cheap table that looks good today might look horrible in 5 years – forcing you to redesign your whole dining room., Seating is an essential element in any dining room. Thus, you need to put a lot of thought into the types of seating and number of options you’ll include. When picking seating, consider:   Provide seating for your average dining party. For most people, this ranges from 8 to 12. Pick chairs based on style and comfort. The style should match or compliment the overall style of the room. In addition, chairs should be comfortable so people can relax and enjoy their meal. Think about using benches or even stools as an alternative to table chairs. Consider adding couches, loveseats, or extra chairs throughout the space. Couches and loveseats, in particular, can create a more intimate setting in a large dining room., After your table and chairs, you need to think about serving tables and side tables when designing your inviting dining room. These tables are important, as they’ll likely make your serving experience easy and more user-friendly.   Consider a buffet. A buffet is a long table or piece of furniture where you can store dishes (underneath or in cabinets) and place food before it is served. Think about adding a simple serving table. Like buffets, simple serving tables are a place to stage food before it is served or a place to sit food and allow people to serve themselves. Add side tables. Side tables are important if you have informal seating areas in your dining room. They may be a place for company to set drinks or appetizer plates while they chat., After picking your furniture, you need to pick accent pieces that will add more character to your dining room. Accent pieces will tie everything together, add your personal touch, and impress guests with your thoughtfulness.   Lighting fixtures. Mirrors. Artwork. Artwork could include paintings, pieces of pottery, glass work, or more. Plants. Rugs. Remember to not add too many accent pieces, as you don’t want the room to feel crowded. This ultimately, is an art rather than a science. A typical rule of thumb, though, is to make sure there is plenty of wall space, floor space, and table space between each item or cluster of items., An important and often overlooked element of any inviting dining room is the drapery. Drapery can set the tone of the room and tie different, contrasting elements together. On the other hand, a poor choice of drapery can send negative messages to your guests.   Choose your drapery after you’ve chosen other major elements of your dining room, like the main pieces of furniture (seats, the table, and serving tables). Depending on your taste and style, you may want to match your drapery to rugs or other accent pieces. Your drapery should always be chosen when considering the color of your wall and floor., At its very core, your dining room is a place where people will experience the colors and textures you’ve chosen. Thus, you need to make sure the color scheme is appropriate, planned, and inviting.   Don’t mix warm and cool undertones. For instance, don’t choose a warm wall paint (tan) and cool drapes (light blue). Consider this when matching the floor, wall paint, and furniture. Avoid mixing smoky or muted colors with bright colors. For instance, don’t choose a washed-out red for drapes and a bright lime for the wall paint. Think about this when you are creating a plan for the whole room. Paint small rooms cool colors. Cool colors, like grey, white, or light blues, will make a smaller space seem larger. Use warm colors in large spaces. Warm colors, like browns, tans, or reds, will make large spaces seem more intimate., When it comes to dining rooms – and other rooms – first impressions are very important. To create an inviting dining space, you need to make sure that the view from your entryway is truly inviting.   Avoid blocking the entryway with tables or chairs. Make sure the space of the entryway transitions into the space of the dining room. For example, if you can balance the walkway space from the entryway and the space between your table and a side table or buffet, do so. Pick a couple pieces of artwork or furniture that will capture your guests’ attention as they enter the dining room., As a place where food will be served and people will dine, your dining room needs to be a place where people can easily move around. Without ample space to move, your room won’t be inviting.   Space chairs so people can easily leave the table. Don’t situate a table to close to a wall or piece of furniture. Take out any pieces of furniture that inhibit the movement of people. For example, while you want to add a cute coffee table to your informal sitting area, it may hinder the movement of people through that corner of your dining room., The easiest way to turn an inviting space into an uninviting space is to clutter it up. By cluttering a space, you send the message that items are more important than people. You also distract people from all the planning you’ve done on your color scheme and furniture.   Don’t view wall space as something to fill or conquer. Position painting and furniture a couple feet apart. Never try to cover table, curio, or china cabinet space completely. Focus on an elegant and balanced look rather than a full look. For instance, you don’t need to display all your rare salt and pepper shakers. Display your most cherished ones, and store the rest. Ask friends and family if they think your dining room has a bare or cluttered look. Let them know that you just want their honest opinion. For instance, say “John, can you honestly tell me whether this room looks bare or cluttered? I’m trying to create an inviting dining space and I think I’m not there yet.”	Design a budget. Look for ideas. Pick a coherent style. Choose your table. Add seating. Pick serving tables and side tables. Choose accent pieces. Choose your drapery. Decide on the color scheme of the room. Create an attractive view from the room’s entryway. Provide ample space to move. Avoid cluttering your dining room.

This routine is a slightly tweaked version of the 6-step. It requires a bit more skill and athleticism as the fifth step is changed so you switch the placement of your body weight quickly. The 5-step is not for beginners so make sure you have a master of the 6-step before attempting this variation.   The first few moves of the 5-step are identical to the 6-step. So you're starting in the push-up position, and extending the right leg in front of the left while keeping the left leg in place. Lean on the outside of your right foot and take your left hand off the floor. Pull the left leg forward. This motion is the same as in the 6-step. Bend your left leg to where it is touching the back of your right leg. Your right leg should be wrapped loosely around your left leg, and you should be in a tilted cross-legged position while keeping your left hand in the air. Bring your right leg out from around your left leg. You should be in the crab position where your legs are shoulder-width apart and your left hand is on the floor behind you. Cross your left leg around your right leg. As in the 6-step, make sure to lean on the outside of your left foot while lifting your right hand up. Here's where it differs. Instead of bringing your right leg behind you as you would in the 6-step, shift hands so you're leaning on your right hand again. Once your body weight is shifted on the right hand, kick your right leg out with your left hand in the air. Bring your right leg in so you're at a crab position which will serve as your new starting point to repeat the 5-step., This version changes certain moves in the beginning while adding an extra step as well that requires more nuanced footwork. When practicing the 7-step, make sure to highlight the differences between the 6-step to make this variation stand out.   As with the 6-step, start in a push-up position on your toes, fingertips, or your palms. Avoid flat feet and hands. Don't bring around your left leg to touch the back of the bent right leg. Instead, bring your left leg over your right so your hip is jutting outward while the right remains in place. You can put your hand on the hip if it helps to maintain balance. Bring your right leg under and in front of your body so it is stretched out while your calf is parallel to the floor. Your left leg while stay in place. Bend your right knee so you are in the crab position. Here both feet should be firm planted should-width apart while your left hand rests behind you. Hook your left leg around your right so your right leg is bent and touching the back of your left. Step your right foot behind you while keeping the left stationary. Bring your left foot under your body so your feet are shoulder-width apart in the same push-up position you started with. , Practice the routine in both directions for added flexibility. You can also reverse alternate directions during the same routine, which will be helpful when adding freezes, where your body stays motionless, and other variations.	Master the 5-step variation. Bring your A-game for the 7-step. Try the 6-Step in both clockwise and counterclockwise directions.
A stuck thermostat might be to blame if your gauge marker nears the red danger zone within five to 15 minutes.; , Unhook your coolant reservoir if you can undo it and pour the antifreeze into a container. Locate your radiator and remove the cap.    You might not need to drain the radiator, depending on the amount your reservoir holds. The amount drained is roughly 1 to 2 qt. (4 to 8 cups). You can reuse this coolant if it is brand new. Otherwise, replace it with new coolant.  The thermostat housing is usually under the upper radiator hose. Unbolt the housing and remove the thermostat, using a screwdriver and pliers. Take the thermostat inside. There will generally be a number somewhere on the body, giving it's opening temperature usually between 160 to 190°F or 70 to 90°C. Otherwise you will need to check the Workshop Manual for the car.  Ensure that the part does not touch the bottom of the pan.  Check the temperature frequently while monitoring the thermostat.   The thermostat should remain closed until it just about reaches the thermostat-opening temperature designated on the body (or in the Workshop Manual). At this temperature, you should see the thermostat begin to open. The part should be completely open when the water reaches approximately 10 degrees above the reading on the thermostat. If the thermostat is still closed at this point, it needs to replaced.	Check your temperature gauge in the car. Turn off your car and allow it to cool before opening the hood. Unfasten the radiator drain cock located near the bottom of the radiator and allow some of the coolant to drain out into a container with a lid until the level is below the upper radiator hose. Locate your thermostat. Fill a pan with water and place the thermostat into the water until it's completely submerged. Start heating the water and place a cooking thermometer into the water.
You need less soap when you have soft water.   You can do a quick test to see if you are currently using to much soap by simply running the washer on a normal cycle and DO NOT add any soap. Also do not add any clothes but run it empty. Notice after about 5 minutes before it drains for the first time if you have soap bubbles on top of the water. You may need a flashlight to see into the drum through your glass door. You can also push the pause button an when you hear the click of the door lock release open the door to inspect. Now close the door and resume the cycle. The very first fill cycle is when the soap that is normally added gets mixed in with the clothes. Every fill cycle after the first drain is only to rinse the clothes. If you get bubbles after your last regular load, you were using so much soap that even with all the regular rinse cycles you were not able to totally rinse out the soap. This will shorten the life of your clothing as they are not meant to have soap in them when the wash cycle is over. You can also test to see if you have residual soap built up in your laundry by putting in a load of CLEAN towels that have not been used yet and run a normal cycle but DO NOT add any soap. Check again toward the end of the first cycle and see if you have any bubbles in the water. If you do, you have soap in the towels from previous washings.; , Some people will tell you that you need to use powdered HE soap vs liquid HE soap. As someone who has worked on the front load machines and taken them totally apart to fix them. Powdered soap that does not totally dissolve can get into the nooks and crannies of the internal metal parts of the machine, which over time cause the parts to fail prematurely. For this reason, use liquid and use the right amount for your water.  For a reference, 2 tablespoons of liquid detergent just covers the bottom of the cap that the soap manufacturer gives you to measure out the soap.   Think about it, the soap manufacturer is in the business of selling soap and is not going to tell you to use less soap because that means less business for them. The manufacturer of your machine is also not going to tell you not to use too much soap because using too much soap will cause your machine to fail prematurely which means you will be a customer for them much sooner then you really need to be, which means more revenue for them.  This is what the internal parts of you washer can look like if you have been using too much soap.  The soap is a food for the black mold that grows inside the pipes of your machine, which is what you are smelling when you smell a foul odor. If you have been using close to the correct amount of soap, then you may not have that odor yet but given enough time most front load machines will get that smell.	Determine if you have hard or soft water. If you have soft water, you only need about 1 tablespoon (1/16 cup) of liquid High Efficiency (HE) soap. If you have hard water, never use more than 2 tablespoons (1/8 cup) of liquid HE soap. After you have used the correct amount of soap (as outlined above), for a month or two, run the same test above just to make sure that with your water and the brand soap you use, it is the correct amount. Using too much soap also adds to the smell that most front load machines either have (or will have) over time.
Bring in a cup of your favorite tea and a book and kick back in those luxurious bubbles until you’re a certified prune. Keep the lavishness going by lighting a few candles and having big fluffy towels and a cozy robe ready for you when you step out of the tub.

Give yourself a small budget and enjoy some quality e-commerce time. Take a break from social media. Reach out to a loved one.
In order to redecorate your room, it is best to start from scratch and gather as many materials as possible. Wiping your room clean will give you a better view of its size, as well as allow you to plan the new layout. Although it may seem useless, the clutter filling up your room could be transformed into decorations if you take the time to sort through it. Take the time to gather all your belongings into one pile, removing items from the floor and furniture. While your room is cleared, run the vacuum over the carpet to remove grime and dirt.; , Once you have cleared out your room, go through your items and categorize them according to their purpose (example: clothes, games, decorations). Set aside belongings that could potentially serve as decorations or materials for a project (example: empty photo frame). Dispose of unwanted ones in a trash bag for quick disposal. Avoid keeping them out of sentiment, as they only waste space in your room. If you have unwanted belongings in good condition, such as clean clothes and books, donate them to a charity shop or have a garage sale. You could also offer them to your friends and family.  Once you have cleared out and tidied your room, decide on its new appearance. You have a variety of options to choose from, such as rearranging the furniture or putting up old posters and pictures. To give yourself a better view, you could sketch out a blueprint of an ideal layout for your room. If you plan on repositioning your furniture, be sure that you leave enough space for the rest of your belongings. You should also make sure that you have room to walk around without feeling suffocated.   Rearranging your furniture is a simple method to transform your room. It can give you a fresh change of scenery and costs no money.  While this step is optional, finding matching colors will help complement your room and make it appear professionally decorated. Select a few decorations (ex: albums, posters, pillows) that have matching colors before setting them up in your room. Be sure that they match your furniture, as well as your bedspread., Search through your categorized piles for cheap decorations to use. Redesigning a room doesn't necessarily require many decorations, as setting out a few in an artistic manner can be more powerful than spreading them all over the place. Find a few eye-catching pieces to personalize your room. These could include photographs of your family, posters of your favorite singers, your favorite albums, etc.  This is an easy, cheap way to decorate a blank wall. A mood board involves a collection of items that evokes happiness. They are pinned onto a large cork board, which can then be hung onto the wall. Simply gather together items that reflect your personality, such as photographs, old concert tickets, CD covers, quotes, magazine clippings/pictures from your favorite films and television shows. Using these materials, create a collage on your board, pinning each one securely in place. Don't worry if it seems cluttered, as its appearance is enhanced with each item that you add.  These can transform your room and change your perspective of it, encouraging relaxation and satisfaction. Simply adding small items - such as photographs of your loved ones in frames or stuffed animals - can spark old memories and evoke feelings of happiness. You should remind yourself that your room belongs to you, which means that you should add small touches of your life to it.  Pasting stars onto the ceiling is a popular method to spice up your room. They not only serve as wonderful decorations during the day but also glow beautifully when the night falls. However, if you don't have glowing stars, you can simply part your curtains to allow the moonlight to flood your room.  A simple way to transform your room is to add a personalized touch to your walls. You could hang up photographs or art pieces, as well as a calendar or cork board. However, you could also draw on your walls, provided that you have received parental permission. Be sure that you are certain about the design you want, as it can be expensive to repaint your walls.	Clear your room. Separate your belongings into piles. Plan the layout. Choose a color scheme. Recycle old items. Make a "mood board". Add small touches. Add glowing stars. Decorate your walls.
Place them on a piece of drop cloth or a sawhorse in a well ventilated area. You should choose to undertake this project when the weather is moderate and not too humid.; , Label them according to the type and set them aside until the painting is done.  Open doors, windows and have a shop vacuum nearby. Place drop cloths around the cabinet boxes.  You should wear long sleeved shirts and long pants, safety goggles, a particulate mask and gloves when sanding.  To increase your efficiency and improve results, buy a small sander, such as a mouse sander, at a home improvement store.   Your goal is to remove the shiny finish of the particle board. Try to sand evenly to avoid creating an uneven surface. The surface right underneath the finish can start to break away if sanded too hard.  Wipe the surfaces of your cabinets with tack cloths. Keep the indoor areas covered, and place cardboard or drop cloths under your sawhorse.  Kilz primer is highly recommended for this type of project, because it seals, primes and blocks stain. It sticks well to particle board.  If you are doing both sides of a cabinet door, wait until it is dry before applying to the opposite side. Allow it to dry well before moving on to paint.  Make sure you sand out any drips from the primer itself. Wipe again with a tack cloth.  Check the reviews at consumer reports before buying, because a quality latex paint is necessary to adhere well to your laminate or particle board cabinets.   Make sure you test your paint colors before you apply them to your entire cabinet set. Test the inside of a door to ensure you like the look.  Use a small foam roller set for doors and large areas of the cabinet box. Use a paint brush to get into the crevices and smaller areas.  Apply a second coat.  You can either choose a finishing wax or a clear lacquer. Apply 2 coats of the material of your choice according to package directions. , Remove the drop cloths and clean up the area around your cabinets using a shop vacuum and detergent.	Remove the doors and drawers from the cabinet set. Remove hardware, such as drawer pulls, hinges and door knobs with a screwdriver. Create a well-ventilated space. Put on safety clothing. Use 80-grit sandpaper pads to sand down all the exterior surfaces of your cabinet boxes, drawers and both sides of the doors. Vacuum the entire area and cabinet boxes with a shop vacuum to remove as many particles as possible. Spray the surfaces of your cabinets with an oil-based spray primer. Spray according to package directions. Sand the cabinets with 220-grit sandpaper. Buy high-quality interior paint at a hardware store. Paint the surfaces of the cabinets with the latex paint. Allow the paint to dry. Apply a finishing material to the cabinets. Let the paint cure on the cabinets, doors and drawers for 2 days to 2 weeks, depending upon the ventilation and heat during your project.  , Reattach the hardware and the drawers and doors.

When moved up or down, this lever will cause a light on either the left or right side of your car to flash.   The turn signal will not make a sound or light the signal light on your car unless the car is running.; , To signal a left turn, wait until you are approximately 30 yards from the corner around which you intend to turn.Ensure you are in the left-turn lane, then push the turn signal lever down gently with your left hand. When the turn signal locks in place, you’ll be able to see a flashing arrow directed to the left on your instrument cluster. You’ll also hear a tick-tock sound which clicks in time with the flashing of the light. This indicates that the signal is operating properly. Return your hand to the steering wheel and continue driving.   Keep your right hand on the wheel while flicking the signal lever down with your left hand. Turn on the signal before braking to let other drivers know why you are slowing.  Ensure you are in the right-turn lane, then move the lever up with your left hand. The series of events which follow are similar to those which occur when making a signal to turn towards the left.   Once you have moved the lever up, an arrow light will begin blinking on the dashboard instrument cluster. You will also hear a metronome-like sound at regular intervals which clicks in time with the flashing light on your instrument cluster.  Normally, the signal will automatically turn off after you have made the turn. Some turns which are at angles of less than ninety degrees, however, might not trigger the automatic suspension of the turn signal after you’ve made the turn. Failing to turn your turn signal off after you have completed a turn can be illegal and cause confusion for other drivers.It is easy to see if your turn signal is still on after you’ve made a turn. Just check the indicator panel above and just behind your steering wheel. Listen for the rhythmic tick-tock sound of the signal blinking on and off. If you see the indicator light blinking or hear the signal sound, reach over to the signal lever with your left hand and gently move it to the “off” position.  Some traffic lanes are reserved for left or right turns only. While it might seem unnecessary to indicate you’re turning when it should be obvious based on the lane you’re in, use the turn signal anyway. Drivers who are not familiar with the area or who cannot see the signs due to multiple vehicles ahead of them in the lane will appreciate the indication as to where you are headed, and could clue them into the fact that your lane is for turning in a given direction. Plus, the law requires that you make a turn with your turn signal.  If you turn your signal on too soon, someone might think you are turning into a parking lot or down a street which you actually are not. This confusion could lead to an accident or to you being cut off.	Locate the lever on the left side of the steering column.The turn signal is a long lever, usually black or gray in color. Use the turn signal to indicate a turn to the left. Indicate a right-hand turn with the turn signal.To signal a right turn, wait until you are within about 30 yards of the corner you wish to round. Ensure your turn signal turns off after your turn has been completed. Signal your turn even if you are in a turning lane. Don’t turn your turn signal on too soon.Only activate your turn signal when there are no intervening streets or alleys between you and the place you wish to turn.
Be ready to negotiate split-second emergencies. Maintain as much control as possible over the car at all times. If your car has a manual transmission, shift gears when needed, but do not keep a needless grip on the gearshift afterward. Instead, return your hand to the steering wheel immediately.Turning on your windshield wipers, headlights, and turning signals also require you to remove one hand from the wheel.But these controls are typically located close to the steering wheel to minimize the time spent driving one-handed. Reversing the car is an exception to this rule.; , Resist the urge to slacken your grip on the wheel. At the same time, be careful not to clench the wheel too tensely. This can tire your arms out and possibly obscure warning signs that reverberate through the steering wheel.”Feeling” the car through the steering wheel is another important reason to steer with both hands.  Picture the steering wheel as an old-fashioned clock with 12 o’clock as the apex of the wheel. With your left hand, hold the wheel at either 9 or 10 o’clock. Then hold the other side at either 3 or 2 o’clock with your right.10-and-2 is better suited for older cars or any others with larger steering wheels and no power steering. 9-and-3 has become the new norm for modern cars equipped with power steering, smaller steering wheels, and airbags.  While driving on paved roads, hold the wheel with your thumbs hooked around the steering wheel. If you turn off-road, remove your thumbs. Place them along the steering wheel's rim, as if you were giving two thumbs-up.Hooking your thumbs under the rim while driving off-road may set you up for injury. Your tires could strike obstacles hard enough to jolt the steering wheel in your hand.If you are driving on a paved road with your hands at 9-and-3, nestle your thumbs along the wheel's spokes where they meet the rim.	Hold the wheel with both hands. Keep your grip firm. Hold the wheel at at "10-and-2" or "9-and-3.", Mind your thumbs.
Bubbles and wind do not mix. You can prolong the life of your bubbles by moving indoors. Blow your bubbles in an enclosed room, such as a garage or a classroom.   Do not blow the bubbles inside a house. The solution may stain the furniture, flooring, or walls., The best, longest lasting bubble solutions, do not contain imperfections. You can limit the imperfections in your solution by using distilled or filtered water. Additionally, only mix the solution in a clean container., Bubbles love a moist, humid environment. In addition to adding glycerin, a natural moisturizer, you can also use a humidifier. The humidifier will add moisture to the air, increasing the life of your bubbles.	Avoid the breeze. Minimize debris. Add moisture to the air.
Instead of using an acronym or technical jargon, use a relevant word or phrase that provides the same meaning. For example, business people like to use SME’s (pronounced like "smees") to describe a person who is a Subject Matter Expert. The time you save by saying “SMEES” is lost when it causes an unfamiliar listener to try to figure out what you mean. Just say “Subject Matter Expert” or “Expert” or “Business Owner” or something to describe the same thing. If you cause your audience to have to think about your last words then they will stop listening until they figure out what you meant.; , If you have the opportunity to discuss a topic that you know a lot about, it is easy to talk at a level of detail that nobody can follow (or care about) except you. People typically only care that the overall process works, not how it works. In sales you talk about benefits with the assurance that the product works, not the features or how it works. Eventually the question will come up where you can bring up the details but that should be based on knowing that your audience wants those details.  The titles people give you in introducing themselves at the beginning of a meeting may be impressive, but not necessarily indicative of what they care about. Don’t rely on their role or title. Instead ask how much detail your audience wants from you. This will not only help you earn their respect it also helps you stay on time and on track.	Use words and phrases your audience understands. Be concise and talk about what’s important to your audience. Ask your audience what they want to hear from you.
Separate your must-have cleaning items into different types, like pre-wash or treatment items, stain-removing items, and post-wash items. Organize them in their own containers for quick access and to prevent damage if something leaks out.; , Buying in bulk can ease the financial strain associated with your chores, so divide dry items into smaller, refillable containers. They have a better appearance, and you will know when it’s time to replace them., Store these in open spaces to allow the laundry to breathe. This will keep your laundry from mildew and other odors. Line your baskets with cloth bags that you can occasionally wash so they can stay fresh.  The best way to access what you need is to know what you are looking at.Even if you know what something is by looking at it, your brain still takes a moment to register it, or you might be distracted. Save your brain for thinking matters, like how to remove specific stains.   Label your cleaning supplies with the same symbols that you find on clothing tags for easier reference.Use small chalkboard labels for containers that house a hodgepodge of rotating items.  Change and other small knick-knacks can collect in pants pockets, and having a small pile of junk can throw off a perfectly organized shelf. A vintage jar can add a nice minor source of inspiration and collect that wayward shrapnel., If you have the resources to create custom cabinetry, mix up drawers and shelves so you can store a larger number of items. If you don’t have those resources, search out shelves that you can build up to maximize your walking space.   Shelves can also be installed from above, which keeps the floor open and doubles as an area to hang dry.  The ironing board is a hefty item that can easily take up space. Luckily, it can fit easily in narrow nooks behind your appliances. Alternatively, hang it up. Whichever you decide, keep your iron and a bottle of distilled water in the same area.	Group cleaning supplies together. Transfer bulk items to manageable sizes. Use laundry baskets to separate clothes. Label everything. Place a bowl or jar near the washer. Build up. Put your ironing board away.
Although dirt does not directly cause rust, dirt and sediment can wear through your paint over time, especially when anyone touches the paint. Other things that can reduce your vehicle’s protection against rust include bird droppings and gasoline that spills when filling the vehicle. Over time, these things wear through wax, clear coat and paint, leaving the metal susceptible to rusting.Wash your vehicle every few weeks so sand and dirt can’t be rubbed through the paint. Bird droppings and gasoline can eat through the paint. Consider washing your vehicle if either comes into contact with the paint.  If you live in an area that snows in the winter, salt and chemical deposits on the underside of your vehicle can compromise its ability to protect against rust. Wash the underside of your vehicle regularly to prevent these materials from sitting on your vehicle for long.Many automatic car washes offer undercarriage cleaning. You may also jack up your car and spray the underside using a hose.  If you often have to deal with road salt, you may choose to add a small amount of baking soda to the soap and water you wash the undercarriage and wheel wells of your vehicle with. A tablespoon of baking soda will neutralize the acidic effect of the salt and other ice melting chemicals used on the roads.Make sure to use baking soda in conjunction with an automotive soap. One tablespoon of baking soda is sufficient to clean the undercarriage of most vehicles.  Leaving dried soap on your vehicle can also reduce the lifespan of the paint. Make sure you rinse all of the soap off of your car or truck each time you wash it. Never wash your vehicle in direct sunlight, as it may cause the soap to dry to the paint much faster.You may choose to apply soap to your vehicle in sections, such as the hood, then rinse it completely before moving on to the next portion of the vehicle. Dried soap will also dull the appearance of the paint on your vehicle.  Wax does more than provide your vehicle with a healthy shine, it also protects the paint from fading and damage. Applying a coat of wax to your vehicle twice a year will provide the paint with an extra layer of protection and help reduce the chances of rust forming.Wax repels water and creates another layer of protection for the paint. Wax will also protect your paint from fading in direct sunlight.	Wash your vehicle regularly. Wash the undercarriage of the vehicle. Use baking soda to neutralize road salt. Rinse the vehicle thoroughly. Wax your vehicle at least twice a year.
Craft or dollar stores are great places to find artificial flowers.; , With a pair of scissors, cut the stem off of the fake flower. You want to make sure to cut enough off so that you are now working with a flat surface.  Let the glue heat up for a few minutes before working with it.    Press it against the base of a blank pin for 15 seconds. If you want something for your hair instead, glue the flower onto a plain barrette. Depending on the size of the pin or barrette you get, you may be able to fit more than one flower onto your new accessory. , After the flower is attached to the pin or barrette, decorate your flower as desired.   Use the hot glue gun for this as well. Be creative! If you'd like, glue on sequins, beads or crystals to the fabric of the flower or to the remainder of the pin or barrette. ,	Assemble the items. Trim the stem. Prepare the glue. Glue on the base of the flower. Let the glue dry for several hours before wearing.  , Decorate. Let the glue dry again for a few hours before wearing.  , Finished.
Acting classes will help you discover your strengths as an actress. Some actresses excel at drama, while others are natural comedians. You might discover that performing Shakespeare is your calling, or that musical theatre is for you. In any case, acting classes teach you to develop and inhabit your character, work with other actors and take direction.   Improvisation classes are a good place to start. Many people immediately think of comedy when they hear the word "improv," but improvisation classes actually teach essential skills for dramatic acting, too. Improvisational acting trains you to pay attention to cues and respond quickly. You'll learn to naturally react to others' prompts and silence your inner critic. Acting workshops will help you understand the craft of acting from a different angle, through "scene studies." Typically, you'll be assigned a few parts in from a few scenes, which you'll practice over an entire semester. You'll participate in class discussions about the meaning of the scene and the intentions of the screenwriter or playwright. Finally, you'll be subject to critiques, and you'll be able to put the skills that you learn into practice right away. When you advance past basic acting classes, you'll have the option to take specialized classes for film or stage acting, which require different skills. Experiment with both to figure out which suits you best. You may enroll in an acting program at a university and pursue a degree in acting, but if you're not ready to commit to an intensive program yet, try taking a few classes at your local community college or theater arts school.; , There are numerous approaches to acting, each of which offer insight and training into accessing and portraying emotion.   The Stanislavski Method is a step-by-step method to building character, and includes script analysis. Stanslavski-trained actresses include Stella Adler and Marilyn Monroe. The Meisner Technique focuses on action-based character development and actor response. Meisner actresses include Tina Fey, Jessica Walter and Naomi Watts. Method Acting involves adopting the behaviors and mindset of your character, and immersing yourself in your character for the duration of the production. Method actresses include Kate Winslet, Natalie Portman and Tippi Hedren.  Once you’ve identified your strengths as an actress and the type of career you’d like to pursue, study the greats. If you want to work in the film industry, watch movies with stars like Meryl Streep, Anne Hathaway and Judi Dench. If sketch comedy is your goal, catch up on shows like Saturday Night Live. And if you’d like to be a stage actress, visit your local theatre and take in plays regularly.  Your daily interactions offer great training. Studying emotional responses to various situations helps you develop your emotional range, while studying facial expressions, speech patterns and body language gives you ideas and tools for creating character and for performance.  You never know when there’s going to be a casting call for an actress who speaks French, plays the piano, juggles or does back-flips. It’s good to have an arsenal of unique talents with which you can distinguish yourself. Likewise, you might find that you can use them to give a character depth and dimension.  There many fantastic books that offer invaluable advice for aspiring and working actors. These books include:    The Intent to Live, by Larry Moss  Audition, by Michael Shurtleff  An Actor Prepares, by Constantin Stanislavski	Enroll in acting classes. Explore acting techniques. Study female roles. People watch. Develop your unique skill and talents. Read up on acting.
; , Turn the valve all the way clockwise, or pull the lever back.  Slide the knob on the round side of the box all the way to front.  Quickly pull down on the cable (or push the lever) twice in quick succession to make the steam whistle sound out two short blasts.  The top one must be moved from right to left to release the brakes on the engine.  Grip it firmly and give it a yank towards you. As you feel the engine move slightly, shove it back in most of the way, so that it does not gather speed too fast. Gradually open throttle as the locomotive approaches track speed. Observe cylinder cock exhaust and close them when only steam is emitted. Move the Johnson bar slowly back toward vertical, but never too close to vertical. This is like the gear shift of your car and admits less steam per cylinder stroke. In turn, this increases the efficiency of steam usage so you don't over work the poor guy throwing coal into the fire (and to conserve fuel and water!) If the locomotive's wheels slip, close throttle most of the way immediately. Allowing the wheels to slip will not render any tractive effort and will damage the locomotive's driving (powered) wheels if done continuously (also "tears" holes in a coal fired locomotive, or in an oil burning locomotive, can cause hollow booms much like an explosion). Wheelslip, as it's called, may cause excess damage if allowed for too long. This includes damage to the firebox itself, which may or may not result in the locomotive exploding. Blow the whistle and ring bell at all crossings of all types and DO NOT EXCEED TRACK SPEED. That is very dangerous, as derailments due to excess speed may occur, even on straight track. This too can cause boiler explosions. See the Wreck of the Old 97 for example.	Push the reverser/Johnson bar forward - grip the very large lever that rises from near the floor in front or beside you, squeeze the release handle and shove it all the way forward, and let go of the release handle to lock it into place. Open the cylinder cocks - find a medium size valve in front of you on the boiler, or a thin lever on the floor in front of you. Turn the front headlight on - above you on the ceiling, there will be a large, flat, half-round box or on the side of the cab wall . Blow the whistle code for forward movement - there will be either a cable, cables or whistle handles, above your head or in front of you on the boiler. Release the engine brakes - two brass horizontal levers will be near your left hand. Open the throttle to start the engine moving - the very long lever close to your face and hanging from the cab roof is the throttle.
You can also chop up a stump to remove it. To use this removal method, you will need a stump grinder. You can rent one from a home improvement store. This machine has a rotary cutter that will drill into and grind up the stump. It's a good method to use if you have a huge, stubborn stump you need to remove. Renting a stump grinder is probably the most prudent option, but if you have a lot of stumps to grind, it might be worth it to buy one.Get protective equipment, too. Goggles and a mask will protect you from sawdust and flying wood chips. If you don't enjoy handling heavy machinery, call a local landscaper and explain that you have a stump that needs to be removed. You'll be able to pay someone else to do it.  Use a chainsaw to level off the stump just a few inches from the ground. Remove any branches or roots that stick up too far off the ground so that the stump grinder will have a stable surface on which to operate.  Put on your goggles and mask, and position the stump grinder over the stump. Then, following the manufacturer’s instruction, move the grinder slowly across the stump's surface to grind it up to bits. Continue along the arial roots to grind those as well until the stump has been fully ground up.          Be careful not to get your feet in the way of the grinder. Wear heavy boots so you won't accidentally hurt yourself. Make sure children and pets are safely away from the equipment before you begin operating it.  Remove all of the wood chips and discard them (or use them as mulch, then fill in the hole with soil.          You might need to use an ax to chop out remaining roots.	Get a stump grinder. Cut the stump close to the ground. Grind up the stump. Shovel out the grindings and fill in the hole.
The wave is a classic hip hop dance move originated with B-Boys and break dancing. You don’t need to listen to early hip-hop to do the wave, but it doesn’t hurt. If you want to listen to the authentic stuff, put on Funk You Up by The Sequence.   You could also listen to contemporary rap or anything that has a groovy beat.  Hold your arms out so you’re making a “T” shape with your body.Be sure that you stay loose while extending your arms. Dancing is all about staying loose.  While in the “T” position, attempt to relax your shoulders. Don’t drop your arms, but try to rest the shoulder muscles. Your arms should be able to still hold with relaxed shoulders.  Start with your right arm and flop it down so that your fingers point to the floor while your elbow points up. You could also begin by pointing your hand up and your elbow down.   Feel free to start with your left arm, if that feels more comfortable.  Imagine the crest or trough of the wave must move through your arms.Move the wave through your shoulders. The key is for one shoulder to move up and have the other down. Then, as you move the wave you will switch shoulders.   The shoulder that was down will go up and the one up will move down., Once the wave passes through your shoulders, it must enter through your other arm. Once the shoulder is up, move the elbow down and move the wave into your hand. When the wave is in your hand, your hand is up while your elbow is down.  Once you’ve sent the wave through one arm, it must return to the “T” shape. Only keep your arm in position until the wave comes back to this arm.  Practice sending the wave to both sides and then reverse the process. You may need to practice a few times before you can send the wave through your arms and reverse.The key is to move with the music. The aforementioned song is slow enough that you can practice each piece of the wave.	Choose the music. Position your arms. Relax your shoulders. Start the pulse. Move the pulse. Continue moving the wave. Bring your arm to equilibrium. Practice the movement.
Soak the seeds for twelve hours in a small bowl of water. Put some moistened sand, sphagnum moss or peat moss in a container with a removable lid, such as a yogurt container.You can purchase night blooming jasmine from online seed retailers. You may be able to find them at your local garden center.; , Cover the seeds with 1 1/16’’ (26.9 mm) of soil. Put the container in your fridge for between one and two months. After this preparation period, which is called stratification, the seeds will be ready for planting.The seeds should be kept at a temperature of between 30 and 40 degrees Fahrenheit (between -1 and -4 Celsius). Every week, check the container to make sure the soil is slightly damp but not too moist. If the soil is dry, you should spray a bit of water into the container. You can put one packet of seeds into the container. At the stratification stage, the seeding density is not a major concern, as long as all of the seeds are exposed to a cold and damp environment.  Use small, four inch (10 centimeter) pots with potting soil or peat pots. Mist the pots with a plant sprayer. Place two seeds down into each of the small pots. Gently press them down, and then mist the pots with a sprayer., Place your small pots in a germination tray or a shallow container. You can place a plastic bag over the tray but remember to leave one side open for ventilation. Keep the tray at a temperature of between 60 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit (16 and 21 Celsius) to allow for germination. You should see the seedlings begin to emerge after two or three weeks, at which point you can remove the plastic bag., Place your tray of seedlings in a warm spot in the house, such as in front of a south facing window. If you have a grow light, you can use it for this purpose. Try to make sure the seedlings get 10 to 12 hours of sunlight per day. When they reach a height of between three and four inches (7 and 10 centimeters), you can go ahead and plant the seedlings.Remember to make sure you are past the last frost date in your region. You can find out the last frost date by visiting either a gardening or a weather website and searching by zipcode. Alternately, you can call the weather service of your local environment agency.  When they reach 3-4 inches (7 and 10 centimeters) in height, you can plant your seedlings outside. Find a nice place to plant your seedlings in the garden, along a pathway or in a container. If you plant the seedlings in your garden, remember that they will need a sunny spot and a bit of room to grow. You should space them between 4 and 6 feet (1.2 and 1.8 meters) apart from one another.If you choose a pot, find a 75 liter (20 gallon) container with lots of drainage holes and a quick draining medium at the bottom such as stones.Fill the container with rich, loose soil., The night blooming jasmine is native to tropical America and the West Indies. It will not tolerate harsh, cold climates. If you live in a warmer climate, you can go ahead and plant it outdoors.If you get a lot of frost in your region, you might want to bring it indoors during the winter months.It will tolerate United States Department of Agriculture zones 8b, 9a, 9b, 10a, 10b, or 11., The night blooming jasmine enjoys full sun to partial shade. It will bloom very well when exposed to full sun, but can also tolerate some shade.It requires at least four hours of sunlight., The night blooming jasmine will do fine in a range of soil types. However, the soil should be rich in nutrients and drain well, since you don’t want the roots to become waterlogged.The soil should be a neutral pH of between 6.6 and 7.5.Use a soil pH test kit from your home garden center. Dig a four inch (10 centimeter) hole. Pour some distilled water in the hole. Insert the test probe, which is included in your kit, into the hole. After one minute, you will get a pH reading.If the soil pH is not amenable to planting night blooming jasmine, you should plant it in a different part of your garden or someplace with a better soil pH. It will do well in a sandy soil., Dig a hole in your garden, which should be large enough to contain the night blooming jasmine seedling. Holding the night blooming jasmine by the root ball, gently place it in the hole. Cover the planting with soil.Place night blooming jasmine at least three feet away from walkways and buildings.  When the top of the soil looks dry, give the plants a good watering.During the first year of the plant’s life, water thoroughly and regularly.Water the night blooming jasmine when the soil looks dry.The frequency of watering will depend on your local climate. You should water more frequently during the spring and summer months.If you are watering the jasmine in a pot, you should stop watering when you see the water draining from the bottom., Dissolve a half teaspoon of 15-15-15 fertilizer in a gallon of water. Pour the mixture over the base of the plant.If the plant is suffering, you can also feed it with a fish emulsion fertilizer during the winter months. Use a half teaspoon (2.46 milliliters) of fish emulsion with a quart of water. Use one cup (236 millilitres) for each foot of the plant. 15-15-15 fertilizer contains a balanced mix of nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium., To encourage new growth and contain their growth, prune night blooming jasmine in the late fall or early spring. Trim the plants back to around three feet (91 centimeters) in height.In order to avoid spreading any disease, it is wise to clean your pruning tools in a bleach solution. You can use a mix of one-part bleach to six parts water.  In the fall, you should bring the pot of night blooming jasmine onto your porch. As soon as you see the temperatures begin to drop anywhere close to 0 Celsius (32 Fahrenheit), you may want to bring the night blooming jasmine indoors. As long as you place it near a sunny window and keep the temperature between 70 and 80 Fahrenheit (21–26 Celsius), it should continue to bloom.	Soak the seeds. Press the seeds down into the container. Plant the seeds in potting soil. Germinate the seeds in a tray. Give the seedlings 10-12 hours of sunlight per day. Plant them outside when they reach an adequate height. Make sure the last frost has passed. Choose a sunny spot. Plant jasmine in rich, well-draining soil. Transplant the night blooming jasmine. Water night blooming jasmine until the soil is saturated. Fertilize night blooming jasmine between late spring and late fall. Prune night blooming jasmine in the fall or spring. Put them near a sunny window for the winter months.
If you love romance, mystery, or something else entirely, you can find an anime about it! There are many different individual genres of anime, but it is also roughly grouped into four main sections by age and gender (not that you should ever let that should stop you if it sounds like something you'd like to watch!)  Shoujo - intended for girls up to the age of 18 Shounen - intended for boys up to the age of 18 Josei - intended for girls over the age of 18 Seinen - intended for boys over the age of 18; , Once you've decided on a genre, see if you can find a list of recommendations. You probably won't have exactly the same taste as the person who made the list, but you can get some good ideas about which anime to try out.  If you're a person who can't watch an anime if the drawings are really bad or not your style, then don't! Drawing styles vary depending on the author, genre and when it was drawn.  They're well-known for a reason! You can start off with the famous ones like Naruto or Bleach.  If you didn't really like it, at least watch the next episode to see if it picks up. Animes need second chances too!	Focus on the genre. Look up lists on the internet. Look at the style of drawing the author uses. Begin with the classics. Try the first episode.
If you need help, Google or post on a Facebook Group. There are thousands of people who would love to help you.; ,, Making sure that what you are doing is legal is essential. The rules vary region by region, so check your local drone/quad-copter regulations., Most people use 2.4ghz for control of the multi-rotor and so the only available legal frequency in the UK is 5.8ghz. It has a restriction though on power. The maximum for the TX is 25mw. This is ok if you have decent clover leaf antennas., Don't fly within five miles of an airport or near radio masts or power lines. Don't fly within 50 meters (160 ft) of any object or person that you don't have direct control over., This requires a license.  There are too many regulations to list, do a quick Google. The CAA govern all of this in the UK. There are different regulation for different parts of the country as well. Check with the local council about what you are doing.   Note: Do not attempt to fly FPV without extensive knowledge of flying. ,,,,  Then Using the left stick (Mode 2) Push it to the right or the left and a little up.	Check that all your supplies are compatible.Assemble it. Check legality. Adjust your frequency. Use common sense. Don't take pictures of anyone and sell them. Power up the multi-rotor and the goggles/monitor.Slowly throttle up and take off.Then, slowly use the roll, pitch and yaw to fly around carefully.Watch closely through the goggles and fly.Take it slow at first. To do a roll, first ensure you are on high rates.
While both Epcot is educating the viewer with real-life situations and about a person's normal environment, both Disney's Hollywood Studios and Animal Kingdom both have standpoints much the same (though one is focused on the movies and the other on animals). The Magic Kingdom is focused on educational views, but in a fantasy-faire way.; , While Magic Kingdom tends to be more fun than any of the other parks for those willing to stand the crowds, other parks can have just the same amount of fun if you know where (good clean) "fun" exists.  While Early Magic Hours takes people away from certain parks when Disney expects to see massive hordes of people, it draws that out on other parks. Crowds will be focused more around the younger set at both Magic Kingdom and Animal Kingdom and the older crowds at Disney's Hollywood Studios and Epcot.  While each park (except Epcot) has at least one, the park with the most thrill in their roller coaster is Space Mountain in the Magic Kingdom (though some people may beg to differ). Reports have been shown throughout websites and in many books including the Unofficial Guides books that Space Mountain trumps the others any day of the year (and in some can sometimes be too much excitement).  While Epcot is set up in two moon-like circles around two famous circular shapes (World Showcase Lagoon and the Epcot(Spaceship Earth) ball), each of the other 3 theme parks have only one real central locale and has several lands traveling around the hub location.  None of the others have this setup; once you're through the gates, the whole park is at your fingertips just by walking (no alternate forms are needed to get from the parking lot and entrance to the park itself. , While the Magic Kingdom is by far the oldest(first opened in 1971), Animal Kingdom (opened in 1998) is by far the youngest of the 4 parks.  Between the Haunted Mansion and Pirates of the Caribbean and it's a small world and the Enchanted Tiki Room, there's no way to resist not going to this park on any Disney World vacation.  While at any given time and day parades could be yanked from the lineup, the two theme parks that don't have parades include Epcot and Animal Kingdom (one was the result of the parade being retired as of earlier 2014 and the other being the result of a retiring and non-replacement in the early 2000s). Most other parks contain at least 1 parade showing, if not 2 per day.  Each theme park is different, but each theme park's lots are based on what the visitor is intending to see.  No matter what park you use, you still have to pay the same admission fee. However, if you exit one parking lot and try to reenter another on the same day, keep your ticket and show it to the nice parking lot attendant and they'll gladly admit you to the parking lots with no additional charge (show your parking lot ticket and you'll be scott free to get in to two different parks on the same day).	Look at the parks from an educational standpoint. Look at the parks from a "fun-like" perspective. Try to compare the crowds. Look for excitement in roller coasters in some parks more than others. Look at the setup of each park. Look towards the travel arrangements between the Ticket and Transportation Center (parking lot for the Magic Kingdom) and the Magic Kingdom itself to be a comparison. Look for kid-like bright cheery colors at the entrance to Magic Kingdom, whereas all the others tend to be less bright and more adult-like in taste.  , Look towards the history of the parks. Look for classic theme rides to exist at the Magic Kingdom. Think in terms of parades. Look towards the differences in the lot names of each theme park. Don't think that by going to any one park the parking info will be any cheaper.
Films Rated G have content in which the board believes is suitable for general audiences.

If you want to stay warm while saving money on heating bills, invest in an electric blanket or heating pad that you can sit on or wrap around yourself as you snuggle on the couch or work at your computer. This will not only save money, but can prevent power outages in cold areas where everyone is using his or her thermostat.You can find fairly efficient warming mats for outdoor pets. Place the warming mat on your chair and a wool blanket over your lap to create a warmer environment. At night, use a hot water bottle. You can purchase them for $10 or less online. Also, wearing an extra layer of clothing, such as leggings under your pants, or a wool sweater, can go a long way in keeping you warm inside your own home. Instead of turning your thermostat up higher, turn it on earlier to give your house time to heat up. You may be making it hotter than necessary because you want your home to get warm as soon as possible.  Hot water and broth raise the temperature of your hands as you hold the bowl or cup. Then they heat your body from the inside for 30 minutes. Drink a cup of tea in the morning to get warm as you get out of bed and include soup into your lunch or dinner plans.  High protein levels and healthy fats increase circulation. People with low iron levels should take extra care to eat foods rich in protein and improve their circulation.   You should also consider throwing some ginger into that nutty trail mix. Ginger has been shown to get blood circulation going and to raise your temperature as well., Exercise also improves your circulation. Whether you exercise at home, in a gym or in the snow, doing 30 minutes per day will keep you warmer inside and out. This will keep your body temperature higher than normal even after you have finished your workout., If you're feeling cold, just cuddle up on the couch with your loved one, spending some time getting close. Just the act of snuggling and touching another person creates warmth. Soon, you'll stop feeling chilly and will feel your body -- and your heart -- getting warmer.  Studies show that the body temperature naturally lowers when you get ready for bed, so you can counteract this by taking a nice warm bath a few hours before bed to raise your body temperature. If you take a warm bath right before bed, it might actually make your body temperature too hot, leading to a restless sleep, but taking a warm bath a few hours before sleeping should do the trick., One study found that being by yourself literally makes you colder, and that spending time with friends will help you get warmed up. The next time you're deciding between a date at home with your electric blanket and a day out with your friends, decide in your friends' favor if you want to stay warm.	Heat yourself, instead of heating the room. Make soup and tea a regular part of your diet. Eat nuts. Work out. Snuggle with your loved one. Take a warm bath. Spend time with friends.
Mix one cup linseed oil, four tablespoons of carnauba wax, two tablespoons of beeswax, and half a cup of apple cider vinegar. Put the ingredients over boiling water by using a double boiler. Heat the wax, and stir frequently until the waxes have melted.         Carnauba wax can be bought at auto stores. If you don’t have a double boiler, put the ingredients in a clean tin can. Set the can in middle of a pot of boiling water. Be careful not to scald yourself when removing the can.  Once the waxes have melted into one another, you should pour the wax into a different container, such as a jar or Pyrex measuring cup. Let the wax cool until it is solid. Once the wax is solid, it is ready to be used.          If you use a container with a lid, you can save the cooled wax for later.  Once the wax is cool, you can scoop it up with a clean cloth. Apply it to the headlights. Work it across the entire headlight using circular motions.  With a different cloth, buff off the wax. Make sure that there are no streaks or residue left on afterwards. The headlight should look polished and sparkling.	Heat the wax. Let the wax cool in a separate container. Rub wax onto headlights. Remove wax with a clean cloth.
The most iconic disco decoration is the disco ball. They produce moving white dots of light when a spotlight is projected on their surface. You can easily find a disco ball online, or make one of your own.  Note that disco balls come in all sorts of sizes. If you’re hoping to fill a living or dining room with moving white dots, get a ball that’s about 12 in (30 cm) diameter. For a larger room, get a roughly 20 in (50 cm) disco ball.; , The disco lighting effect is amplified if you mount the ball on a motor that rotates the ball and moves the dots of light around the room. You can purchase disco balls that come with a motor, or purchase the motor separately online.Be sure to get a motor that can handle the size and weight of your ball. Some motors are designed for small disco balls, while others can handle larger ones.  Choose a location near the middle of the room that has a horizontal surface you can attach the motor too, such as the ceiling. If the motor is powered by a plug, plan the route that the cord will take. Most disco ball motors will mount to the ceiling with screws. Keep in mind that there will also be a light aimed at the disco ball, so there must also be an appropriate space to hang a light that will point at the ball.  There are specific lights designed for use with a disco ball, but many different spotlights will work. The important factor is that the light is focused, or pointed in a particular direction like a spotlight. The effect will be even better if you are able to point two spotlights at the ball from different directions.You can mount the spot lights in many different ways. If you get a spotlight specifically for this purpose, it may even attach to the disco ball's base. It may also have a base of its own that you attach to the ceiling separately. The ideal distance between the mirrored ball and the spotlight depends on the size of the ball, as well as the size and strength of the light. Experiment with positioning the spotlight in different locations relative to the ball and mount it where it provides the desired effect.  Some spotlights have features that supplement the lighting effect that is made by the disco ball. For instance, you can get a spotlight that rotates through different colored filters, so that the dots of light moving around the room change color periodically.	Get or make a mirrored ball. Consider getting a disco ball motor. Hang the motor from the ceiling. Position one or two spotlights pointing at the disco ball. Get a disco-specific spotlight.
As mentioned in the introduction, there are plenty of alternate ways of getting somewhere. Think about whether it might be possible to walk, bike, or take a bus, train, cab, or rideshare. If none of these options are available to you, or they would require unreasonable hardship, then you might consider asking someone for a lift. A good rule of thumb when asking someone a favor is to make sure that the benefit to you significantly outweighs the inconvenience it might cause the other person.; , While whether or not someone owns or has easy access to a car is the first thing you should consider when deciding to ask for a ride, don’t make assumptions about their availability or willingness. Even if they’ve given you a ride once, twice, or a hundred times before, don’t take it for granted that they’ll be able to help you every time you need to get somewhere.  If you have a relationship with someone where you’re already in the practice of regularly doing favors for each other, such as those that are common between family members, romantic partners, or close friends, this is ideal. Otherwise, consider who might be least inconvenienced by your request.   If you need a ride home from work, consider asking the coworker that you know drives by your street every day, anyway. Or if you are going to dinner with a group of friends, maybe ask the friend that lives closest to you for a lift to the restaurant. Make sure you consider lifestyle factors, too. If you have a friend with two small children, or who’s been working a lot of overtime lately, they will likely need to be more conservative with their extra time and energy than your friend who teaches guitar lessons three afternoons a week and still lives with his parents. If your cousin wakes up early every morning for her job, you probably don’t want to ask her for a ride to the airport to catch your red eye flight. Or a friend who works as a bartender probably won’t be very excited about bringing you to pick up your car from the body shop at seven a.m. on a Saturday. It’s extremely important that you know the other person well enough to be sure you feel safe spending time alone with them. It’s never a good idea to get into a car with a near-stranger, or someone with whom you don’t feel comfortable.  When you’ve decided whom you’ll ask, you’ll want to be forthcoming about your intentions at the beginning of the conversation. If you try to make small talk about other things first the entire conversation can come off as disingenuous when you finally come around to the point. It’s also a good idea to begin the conversation with something along the lines of “Hi so-and-so, I have a favor to ask you…”. Not only is this appropriately straightforward, but using the word “favor” also shows that you understand the person would be going our of their way for you, whereas “Could you please give me a ride to work tomorrow?” could run the risk of sounding like a command, and therefore off-putting. , If you know you are going to need a ride somewhere, don’t wait until the last minute to ask. Give the other person as much advance notice as possible, so that they can factor it into their schedule that day.   This also goes for asking for a ride in front of other people. Many people have a difficult time saying no if there is an audience, and they might suspect that you are capitalizing on this.  While this is recommended any time you take a ride from someone, it is an absolute must in the instance that someone is picking you up and bringing you somewhere they don’t also need to be, such as the airport, a doctor’s appointment, or a job interview.   Often people will refuse to take your money, but don’t count on this! Make sure you have cash on had to give them, just in case.  If someone says they’re unable to give you a ride, don’t press the issue. Resist asking for an explanation, and don’t argue or challenge them. Instead, be gracious and thank them for their time.  Putting in a little extra time and effort on your end shows the person that you are taking their time and effort into consideration, and that you value the favor they are doing for you. Here are a few examples of ways you might make the experience easier for them:   If your destination is a place regularly frequented by most people, such as the grocery store, offer to accompany them whenever they are next planning to go, rather than requesting they make a special trip. If you live at the corner of a difficult intersection, offer to walk a block or two in order to meet them where it’s easier to pull over. If they are giving you a ride somewhere that they may have never been before, make sure you have clear directions, or have the address already plugged into the map function on your smart phone. Be ready to go at least five minutes before you expect them to show up, so that they won’t have to wait for you in the instance that they are running a few minutes ahead of schedule.  Try to make the other person’s experience of being in the car with you as enjoyable as possible. This is not only respectful, but it will also increase the likelihood of this person agreeing to help you in the future. Often being pleasant is just a matter of not doing certain annoying things:   Don’t criticize the person’s car, for instance, no matter how beat up or messy it is. Don't criticize their driving, and avoid being a "backseat driver". Don’t fiddle with any of the car’s dials. Even if they are listening to most boring talk radio station ever, or the air conditioning is freezing your face off. If you absolutely must, ask the driver politely if they'd be willing to change the radio station or turn the air down. Don’t be a chatterbox. If the other person wants to talk, that’s great! But if they don’t seem like they are interested in chatting, let yourself be comfortable with the silence. Some people need quiet in order to concentrate while they drive, or they might be particularly interested in what they’re listening to on the radio.  While you might not be able to pay the person back in kind, you should still find a way to show your appreciation. What this entails exactly will depend on your preexisting relationship with the person, and the degree of inconvenience to them.   If you get a ride home from a coworker who lives in the same building as you, a simple text saying “Thanks again for the ride! I really appreciate it!” might suffice. But if a friend wakes up at three thirty in the morning to drive you an hour to the airport, you probably want to consider something a little more meaningful. Perhaps you can pick them up a small gift on your trip, or treat them to dinner when you get back. However, if you are dealing with prohibitive financial issues and can’t afford a gift or dinner, a thoughtful, hand-written thank you card will work, too. Make sure to do this after they have agreed to help you, as otherwise it can seem like you’re trying to obligate them. For instance, don’t bake your friend cookies and as she’s biting into the first one, ask her for a ride to the dentist next Friday.	Make sure you’ve first considered other options. Don’t assume that just because someone has a car, they can give you a ride. Decide whom you’ll ask. Don’t beat around the bush. Don’t put them on the spot. Offer to help pay for gas. Take no for an answer. Make it as easy as possible for the person who is giving you the ride. Be pleasant in the car. Plan to reciprocate.
Visit a hardware or home and garden store to find the raw lumber required to fashion the wooden cages. For this project, you will need two 2x2x8’ boards, along with three 1x2x8’ pieces. The wood will require a few simple cuts to form the different parts of the tomato cage.Wood is generally cheaper and easier to find than other materials like concrete wire and livestock paneling. Because it is an organic material, wood is less durable than metal. You should get plenty of use out of wooden tomato cages, but don’t expect them to last as long as cages constructed from metal wire or paneling.  Cut each of the 2x2x8’ boards perfectly in half. You should now have four 2x2x4’ pieces. These will serve as the upright supports for the cage. Cut the 1x2x8’ boards into sections that are 18” and 19.5” long. You should have six of each of these pieces total. They will act as the rungs for the upright supports.Make all the necessary cuts first. Then, all that’s left to do is nail or screw the pieces together. You will have some wood left over after cutting the 1x2x8’ boards. The leftover wood can be saved for future projects or used elsewhere in your garden.  Using a nail gun or wood screws, attach three of the 1x2 rungs to two of the 2x2 legs to make a basic ladder construction. The rungs should be placed roughly 15” apart, starting at the top of the ladder and leaving space at the bottom for the supports to be driven into the ground. Repeat this process to craft the other side of the cage. Then, attach both ladders by securing three 19.5” sections of 1x2 lumber perpendicularly to the sides.The 19.5” sections will overlap the ends of the ladder construction, including the 18” rungs you attached previously.  Position the wooden cage over a tomato plant. Press down firmly to mark where the legs are to go in the soil. Dig a small hole for each leg, about 4” deep. Set the legs of the cage down into the holes and fill in the space around them with loose soil. This process will result in a single tomato cage.If you’re planning on making multiple cages, take an assembly-line approach. Do all of your measuring and marking at once, followed by all your cutting, then screwing or nailing. You can also drive the cage into the ground using a hammer or mallet, being careful not to damage the structure. It may help to sharpen the legs or cut them into points first.	Buy the lumber for the cage. Cut the supports and rungs for the cage. Screw the assembly together. Place the cage over your tomato plants.
A traditional eyepatch is made out of black cloth. You can use the cloth of your choice. A popular material is canvas, but this isn’t the most comfortable. You could instead use a fabric that is soft like cotton, if you plan to wear the patch for an extended time period.You can also gather scrap cardboard if you choose to use it.; , Use a ruler to measure one of your eyes and the surrounding area. Most eyepatches will extend from your eyebrows to below your eyes. Measure from your eyebrows to the top of your cheek bone for the vertical distance. Then measure from the center of your nose to the other side of your eye for the horizontal distance. Jot these measurements down on paper.   After gauging how large you want your eyepatch, measure and draw the dimensions onto the cloth. You can use chalk to best see your outline.Create a sunglass lens shape out of the rectangle. Be sure to hit the edges of the rectangle when drawing your outline.  Use sewing scissors to cut out your eyepatch.Once you have your patch cut, use a lighter to burn away any of the frayed strings left behind. Removing the frayed strings will create a cleaner looking eyepatch.  To create a stiff eyepatch that will look dramatic, you can attach a piece of cardboard to the backside of the eyepatch. Lay the eyepatch onto a piece of clean cardboard. Then trace the patch onto the cardboard using a pen. Now cut out the cardboard.   Glue the patch onto the cardboard using standard glue or a hot glue gun. Use more fabric than is needed to completely cover the cardboard, and curl the excess fabric onto the back side of the cardboard so that the front of the patch is seamless. This isn't necessary, but it might look more believable than just using cloth.  Use a seamstress’ measuring tape to measure your head. Take note of your dimensions. When preparing the string you should leave extra slack to account for attaching and adjustments.  Use black string for an authentic look. Measure out your string to the same length you documented for your head. Remember to leave about two inches of slack for tying knots and adjustments.   If black string isn't available, use whatever you have. Darker colors work best.  Some hair ties will work as a string for your eyepatch. If you find that your hair tie is too small, use a headband. Cut whichever type of band you use so that it is in the shape of a string.   You can also rip an elastic band out of an old pair of pants.  Before attaching the string to the eyepatch, try wearing it by using your hands to hold everything in place. This will help you gauge if the string is the right dimension.   Make adjustments if needed., You can either create a hole to tie the string, or glue the string onto the patch. If you decide to make inserts into the patch, use a sharp knife. Create small holes on the far left and right side of the patch.   If you decide to glue, prepare a hot glue gun or superglue., Tie a small overhand knot if you created holes. Make sure you took into account the slack needed to attach the string. Use a hot glue gun or superglue to attach the string. Glue your string behind the front of the patch to create a sleeker look., Eyepatches are classic accessories for a variety of costumes. Slip the eyepatch over your head and you have your very own eyepatch.   For decorations, you can color onto the patch using a white marker. A classic costume decor is the pirates flag.	Gather your cloth. Measure the dimensions. Cut the outline. Use cardboard for support. Measure your head. Prepare the string. Use a hair tie. Test it on yourself. Prepare a hole. Attach the string. Wear the patch.
The largest pumpkins balloon out from the vine. Vines generally have two to three pumpkins. Once your pumpkins have reached the size of a softball, select the one on a vine that looks the most promising. You will have to cut out the others as they will steal nutrients from the prize pumpkin., Pumpkin vines grow roots at every leaf. Tearing out the roots nearest to the pumpkin will allow the pumpkin a bit of wiggle room. If the vine is held down by the roots near the pumpkin, the pumpkin might accidentally tear itself away from the vine as it grows massive. This would effectively end any more growth.   Train vines away from the pumpkin. While growing, the pumpkin could accidentally crush the vines near it.       Make sure to weed the area completely as your pumpkin vine grows. Once it reaches twenty feet and has covered the garden with leaves, you shouldn't have to weed anymore.  Only do this when the primary vine has reached 20 feet (6.1 m) in length. Pinching off the ends and side shoots will guarantee that the vine’s nutrients will go to your pumpkin.   To increase the chance of a prize-winning pumpkin, shape the vine into a triangle. Treat the base of the vine as the bottom of the pyramid. You can cut the secondary side shoots shorter and shorter as they grow farther away from the base. For example, the shoots growing closest to the base might be twelve feet long; the next set of shoots might be ten feet long, then eight feet and so on., You can either drape a sheet over it or build a small structure to hold a tarp up over the pumpkin. That said, try not shade too many of the leaves. These need sunlight to grow the pumpkin., Only do this if it is a dry season. Pumpkins do most of their growing at night. Water in the early evening so that the leaves and soil are not wet overnight. Try to avoid getting water on the leaves because wet leaves are more susceptible to disease., If you notice insects or other pests in your garden, research what they are, and take appropriate measures to control them. Growing flowers and herbs near your pumpkin patch can attract predator insects that naturally keep pests down.  Common pumpkin pests include squash bugs, striped and spotted cucumber beetles, aphids, vine borers, wireworms, and six spotted leafhoppers., Your pumpkins will be ready to harvest when they are a solid, deep color (and they are gigantic!) The rind should be hard. The vines will usually be dying back at this time.	Pick your prize pumpkin. Tear out the roots that are close to the pumpkin. Pinch off the ends and side shoots. Give the pumpkin shade. Give each plant 15 to 20 gallons (56.8 to 75.7 L) of water twice a week. Keep pests away. Harvest your pumpkins.
Realize that she was only 13 years old when she released Friday, and has since become remarkably known throughout America. Her mother spent $4,000 for her song to be made into a single and the same week it was released to the Internet.Although it was for all the wrong reasons, her single Friday went viral on YouTube, receiving over 167 million views before being taken off of YouTube due to, according to the video, copyright reasons. Additionally, it is possible that the video was removed from YouTube also due to negative/threatening comments and cyber-bullying, which had a very strong impact on Black's life,with the result of Black being homeschooled instead of being taught at a school.   Notice that not very long after removing Friday from YouTube, Rebecca Black re-posted the video on YouTube, despite influence to not repost the video. This can show that Rebecca Black was not afraid of threats and hatred.; , Although the lyrics are so simple and obvious that they're silly, think about how relatable they really are for teenagers. Everyone wakes up in the morning and has breakfast, and people do look forward to the weekend. Although the lyrics are repetitive, they ring true.  If you listen closely to the beats of the song and, you will realize what a creative song she created. The song uses an I-vi-IV-V chord progression. Many other popular songs have used this chord progression. "Friday" is performed in the key of B major with a tempo of 122 beats per minute. The familiar structure makes the song catchy.  Black used auto-tune in Friday, meaning that her voice was edited a lot. Realize that because of the excessive use of Auto-Tune, Rebecca's real voice is not portrayed in the song, so she is not necessarily as bad a singer as it seems. Therefore, there is nothing wrong with her musical talent because her voice was completely edited. Realize that if there hadn't been a use of auto-tune (or not as much of it), the song may have been better.  Black's following single, My Moment used little auto-tune compared to Friday. Possibly because of this, My Moment has a much better "like/dislike" ratio on YouTube than "Friday".  My Moment is about the fact that she didn't get discouraged from becoming a singer after all the "dislikes" that Friday received. Black states "this song is for you, haters". Admire the fact that instead of quitting singing for good, Rebecca Black decided to record another song, showing her determination.  Don't predetermine that you will hate Black's new music just because you hated Friday. Go in with an open mind and treat it like somebody else's song. Instead of thinking about Friday, think about only her new songs. Realize that Black's music shouldn't be hated just because of it's predecessor.  Rebecca Black is generally busy writing songs and preparing them for the public.    Person of Interest, which followed My Moment, was another single released by Rebecca Black.	Search for information about Rebecca Black and her music on the Internet. Realize the simple brilliance of the lyrics of Friday. Listen for patterns in her song. Think about the use of auto-tune. Understand that Rebecca Black learned from her mistakes with "Friday". Admire the meaning of My Moment. Listen to her new music with an open mind. Expect more singles and albums to be released.
A sure sign that there’s an issue with your vehicle’s cooling system is finding a puddle of coolant under your vehicle. Remember that there are a number of fluids in your engine that could feasibly leak, so check closely to confirm if the puddle you find is coolant, oil, or possibly even just water from running the air conditioner.Touch the puddle with your finger, then wipe it on a white sheet of paper to see what color it really is. If it is green or orange, it’s likely a coolant leak.; , If you believe your vehicle may be leaking coolant, check the coolant reservoir in the engine bay. Most coolant reservoirs have “fill lines” labeled on the container that will let you know if the coolant levels are low in your vehicle. Check the coolant level in your vehicle and top it off with a water/coolant mixture if it appears to be low. Check it again after a few days to see if the level has changed.Make sure to check the coolant levels with the vehicle at about the same temperature each time (either warm from driving or cool from sitting). Dropping coolant levels in conjunction with puddles means a coolant leak is very likely. Check in the owner's or service manual for your vehicle to locate the coolant reservoir if you are unsure of where to find it.  If your engine is low on coolant, or the coolant needs to be changed, it will struggle to maintain a proper running temperature. Keep your eye on the temperature gauge in your vehicle. If it begins to run consistently warmer, or begins to overheat sporadically, there is an issue with your cooling system.Failing to adequately cool your engine could mean your coolant levels are too low. Coolant can eventually go bad. If the coolant levels are still high but the engine is overheating, one issue may be that the coolant needs to be replaced. If you are uncertain of what the symbols on your gauges mean, refer to your vehicle's owner's manual to determine which is the temperature gauge.  If you suspect that your coolant system may be leaking, spray the engine with a hose to remove any existing signs of a leak. Then start your engine and visually inspect the engine bay, looking closely for signs of a leak. Coolant is usually under pressure, so a leak could spray out or it may only trickle. Wear safety glasses and exercise caution while looking around the engine bay with the engine running.Do not put your hands inside the engine bay with the engine running. Look for any new signs of coolant leaks then follow the coolant to the highest point to locate the crack or hole.  The coolant system is under pressure while heated and opening the radiator cap or petcock while the system is under pressure could result in serious burns. Allow the car to sit for a few hours to make sure it’s completely cool before coming into contact with any parts of the coolant system.After a few hours, lightly tap the top of the radiator to see if it is cool to the touch. If it’s warm, the coolant inside may still be quite hot. Opening the coolant system while hot will result in heated coolant spraying out, which is extremely dangerous.  In order to access the bottom of the radiator to drain the old coolant, you’ll need to raise the vehicle to a height that allows you to work and place a container beneath it to catch the draining fluid. Locate the designated jack points for your vehicle by consulting your owner’s manual to avoid doing any damage to the vehicle while you jack it up.Once the vehicle is high enough to slide your container underneath it, place jack stands beneath it to support the weight of the vehicle. Never work under a vehicle that is supported only by a jack. Jack stands will prevent the jack from losing pressure and lowering the vehicle while you’re beneath it.  Locate the petcock on the bottom portion of the radiator. The petcock often looks like a spout with a valve you can turn to open it, and it should be on or near the bottom of the radiator to allow it to drain. Once you have located it, make sure the container is positioned properly beneath it and open the valve.The coolant should be cool coming out of the radiator, but you should still take care to avoid letting it come into contact with your bare skin. Check your owner’s manual for the vehicle’s coolant capacity and make sure you have a container large enough to hold it all at least twice.  Once you’ve finished draining the radiator, there will still be a great deal of bad coolant remaining in the system. Close the petcock and fill the coolant reservoir with water. Start the engine and allow it to run for a few minutes before draining the radiator again. You should repeat this process two or three times.If you only allow the engine to run for a few minutes each time, it should not get too warm to drain the radiator. The water will flush out the rest of the bad coolant from the engine.  Most vehicles require a 50/50 water and coolant mixture to maximize the coolant system’s efficiency. You can purchase pre-mixed coolant, or choose to mix it yourself. Fill the reservoir until it is an inch above the “full” line, then start the engine. As it warms up, the thermostat will open, allowing coolant to flow in. As the coolant level drops in the reservoir, continue to add to it. Add the mixture to the radiator or reservoir until you reach the maximum suggested capacity.If you do not have your owner’s manual, check the vehicle manufacturer’s website for fluid capacities. It may take a few minutes for the coolant to drain into the system, so be patient as your pour the new coolant in. If your vehicle’s radiator has a bleeder valve on the top, open it and allow the engine to run for ten minutes to allow any excess air to escape.  A common point of failure on radiators is the cap itself. Radiator caps are designed to allow excess pressure to escape to avoid damage to the coolant system, but over time they can become oxidized, full of grime, or just worn out. To replace your radiator cap, simply wait for the engine to cool completely and twist the old cap off. Screw the replacement on in its place. You can purchase replacement radiator caps at your local auto parts store. Make sure to ask for a cap that fits your vehicle’s exact year, make and model.  Commercial leak sealants are sold at most auto parts stores and can help resolve a radiator leak if you’re in a bind. However, it’s important to note that these leak sealants aren’t designed to be permanent repairs. To use a leak sealant, simply open the radiator cap on a cool engine and pour it in. Top off the radiator with a coolant and water mixture if it is low as a result of the leak You will likely still need to locate and repair the leak, or replace the radiator after using a leak sealant. Leak sealant is a great option if you need to get your vehicle home or to a repair facility.  If you are able to locate a crack in your radiator, you may be able to repair it using an epoxy. First clean the area around the crack thoroughly, as any dirt or grease may prevent the epoxy from establishing a seal. Use a spray on brake cleaner and a rag to remove any stuck on grime, then allow the cleaned area to dry completely. Use your hands to knead the epoxy until it becomes malleable enough for you to spread it out over the entire crack.Allow the epoxy to set overnight before starting the vehicle. Radiator epoxy can be purchased at most auto parts stores.  If there is a crack in your radiator, it is highly likely that you may need to purchase a replacement for it. To replace your radiator, drain all of the fluids from it and disconnect the hoses leading into and out of the radiator. Unbolt the brackets that hold the radiator in place and slide it up and out of the front of your vehicle. Different vehicles will have different mounting hardware, but it’s common for radiators to be held in place by four to six bolts. Slide the new radiator into place and secure it using the same bolts.You may have to remove body or trim panels to access the radiator bolts or to remove the radiator from the vehicle. You can purchase a new radiator from the vehicle manufacturer or most auto parts stores.	Look for puddles beneath your vehicle. Check the coolant reservoir. Pay attention to changes in your temperature gauge. Visually inspect your engine bay. Allow the engine to cool completely. Jack up the vehicle. Open the petcock and drain the coolant into a container. Flush the radiator using a hose. Refill the radiator with a water and coolant mixture. Replace the radiator cap. Use a commercial leak sealant. Seal visible cracks with epoxy. Replace the radiator.
Trying to paint ceiling corners with a bunch of furniture in the way will only make a hard job even harder. Plus, you risk dripping paint on your furniture by accident. Pull furniture away from the walls and move it to the center of the room before you get started. If you’re painting the whole ceiling and not just the ceiling corners, remove your furniture to another room entirely., Lay blue painter’s tape along the entire perimeter of the wall where it meets the ceiling. This will prevent the paint you’re applying to the ceiling from accidentally getting on the wall., Lay down a drop cloth before you start working. If you don’t have a dropcloth, use an old set of sheets.If you’re only painting ceiling corners, you can probably get away with just laying down some thick cardboard or a layer of newspapers beneath the corner in question.  Painting ceiling corners can be messy. Wear heavy overalls or old clothes when painting. Do not wear new clothes or anything that you might be concerned about if it got paint on it.Disposable rubber gloves might also be useful. Wear a hat, too, to protect your head.  To start the process, dip a five or six-centimeter-wide (three-inch-wide) paintbrush into your paint of choice. Move the brush along the ceiling in one continuous direction, painting a six-centimeter (three-inch) margin of the ceiling.Use a ladder to reach the ceiling. Place your bucket of paint on top of it. If the ceiling corners you wish to paint are too tall to reach with a ladder, erect scaffolding. Paint the edge of the ceiling as thickly as possible without the paint dripping., When you reach the corner of the wall, begin painting another continuous margin along the adjoining wall, heading away from the corner. Use your paintbrush to paint this strip, too. This second margin along the ceiling should be just as wide as the first strip you painted., After painting a strip of paint across the entire perimeter of the ceiling, dip your loaded roller into the paint of your choice. Roll it towards the ceiling corner you’re interested in painting in such a way that it overlaps a bit with the area you just painted with the paintbrush. Roll in one direction toward the opposite side of the room.Do not place the roller directly overhead or you risk dripping paint on yourself. Use a roller with a nap of more than ½ inch (one centimeter)., You’ll be able to tell that you need more paint on your loaded roller when you notice that it is no longer applying paint to the ceiling. When this happens, dip – but do not submerge – your roller in paint., After your first corner has been painted, paint the ceiling in strips that touch each other, and that run parallel to the direction in which you painted the first corner. For instance, if you painted the ceiling corner by pushing the loaded roller from the front to the back of your room, continue applying paint by moving the loaded roller along a front-to-back axis.In this way, you’ll paint two corners, then the rest of the ceiling, then the final two corners.  As you paint the ceiling, step back and examine your progress. Look for areas where the paint has been applied unevenly (that is, areas where the paint is too light). Roll the loaded roller across these areas when you detect them., If you decide to apply a second coat, use the same method you did the first time – use the loaded roller to apply the paint in parallel strips – but move in a direction perpendicular to the strips you applied the first time.	Remove any furniture that you can from the room. Tape the edges of the wall. Protect your floor. Wear old clothes or overalls. Use a paintbrush to paint towards the corner. Paint away from the corner. Paint toward the corner with a loaded roller. Reload your roller with paint as needed. Move in parallel strips to cover the ceiling. Evaluate your work regularly. Let the paint dry before deciding if it needs another coat.
A clear parking area will allow you to freely move around your car to fill up tires without anything getting in the way. Parking on a level surface will make it easier for you to balance and operate your pump.   If you don't have a suitable clear, flat surface at home, you might park in the street or a neighbor's driveway. Driving on tires that are flat can damage your tire or deform the rims of your wheels, causing expensive damage. Drive as little as possible on flat tires.; , The valve cap for each tire will be on the sidewall of the tire, positioned closely to the metal of the wheel's rim. Generally, these caps are screw-on. Unscrew the valve caps for all tires.Valve caps are small and easy to lose. To prevent yours from getting lost, keep them in a sealable container, like a plastic baggie or a lidded plastic container.  This value will be in PSI (pounds per square inches). The recommended tire pressure for your vehicle is generally written on a sticker inside of the driver's door. Open this door and inspect it for a tag indicating the ideal air pressure.If you can't find the tire pressure information on your door, or if the information is unreadable, tire pressure information can be found in your car's manual. In the rare case that you lack both the tire pressure door sticker and your car's manual, you can look up the optimal air pressure for your car and tire online. For some vehicles, the recommended tire pressure for front and back tires may be different., Wait for three hours after driving for the most accurate reading.Inspect the tire pressure gauge and tire valve to make sure these are free of dirt or grit. This can sometimes get caught in a valve, making it leak, difficult to pump, or difficult to take a pressure reading. Take your gauge and:   Position it on top of the stem the tire valve. Press the gauge into the valve firmly until the sound of escaping air ceases, then release. Look at the reading on your gauge. Many common gauges have a slide reader that pops out of the base of your gauge after taking the reading. Compare this reading to the recommended PSI to determine whether your tire needs air. Repeat this for all tires on your vehicle., Take your bike pump and position its valve end over the valve of the tire you are pumping. The lever on the back of the valve should be touching the hose in the unlocked position. Press the pump valve firmly onto the tire valve, then raise the lever to lock the pump onto the tire valve.   When attaching your pump to the tire, you'll likely hear air escaping. This is completely natural when locking your bike pump valve in place. A Shrader valve generally has a stem, at the end of which is threading for a screw on cap. Inside the end of the stem, you should see a small metal pin. Presta valves, the second most common valve used for bike pumps, will have a thin, threaded cylinder of metal extending from the stem. Many bike pumps come equipped with a Shrader valve, which is also called an American valve.This part is necessary for pumping up your car tires.  Raise and lower the pump bar of your bike pump steadily. At regular intervals, check your tire pressure. Overfilling your tires can cause strain on the tire and compromise its integrity.Always follow the manufacturer recommendations for best results, but generally, avoid filling your tires with five PSI more or less than the recommended amount. A bike pump will move less air at a slower rate than a compressor, which means that this can take quite some time before your tire is filled., In the event you overfilled your tire with air, use your tire pressure gauge or some other tool to press the pin in the center of the tire valve to the side of the valve. This will release air in the tire and decrease pressure.   Check your tire pressure regularly while adjusting. If you release too much pressure, you'll have to pump again.Be precise when filling your tires with air. Filling tires with unequal amounts of air will cause them to wear out more quickly, negatively impact fuel economy, and more., In the fashion described, move from tire to tire, checking tire pressure, inflating, and adjusting each until all tires are the same pressure. When all tires are complete, take your valve caps from their container and reattach them., In a pinch, these kinds of gauges can give you a rough idea of the air pressure of your tires. However, these are often inaccurate and wear out easily, so a separate tire pressure gauge is best.   Tire pressure gauges are relatively inexpensive and small. Put one in the glove box of your car so you always have one on hand., Sometimes, the pump valve and the tire valve will seat poorly, creating gaps where air can escape. This can decrease the amount of air you pump into the tire with each pump.   In especially bad cases, a poor seal between valves can cause the tire to deflate faster than you are inflating it. Most poorly seated valves can be corrected by removing the pump valve and reattaching it again.  Bike pumps have a fairly long shelf life, but the hose of older pumps can break down over time. Cracks in it can result in more air being pumped outside the tire than what makes it inside.   Frequently, corroded or cracked hosing can be identified by sight or with a touch check. If you feel cracks, holes, or disintegrating hose, your hose may have a leak.	Park on a clear, flat surface. Remove valve caps. Determine the optimal pressure for your tires. Check tire pressure with a tire pressure gauge. Attach your pump to the tire valve. Pump up your tire. Adjust tire pressure as necessary. Inflate the remaining tires. Avoid using gauges attached to air compressors. Verify the pump is securely fastened. Inspect the hose of your pump for leaks.
On the rear of your Roomba there is a tray that fills with dirt and dust as it vacuums (also called the "bin"). Press the button on top of this tray and remove it. Dump the contents of this tray into the trashcan., You should be able to see a red semi-circle inside the tray (which may be covered with gray dirt and dust). This is your filter. This filter will easily slide out of the tray, while remaining attached on one end. Slide this out, and knock any loose dirt/dust off into the trashcan., Attach the crevice tool (the long, thin attachment) to the hose of a regular vacuum cleaner. Then turn the vacuum on and use this attachment to remove dirt and grime from the Roomba collection tray and filter., Remove the crevice tool from your vacuum hose, and instead attach the brush tool. Turn your vacuum back on and go over the filter and tray once again. This time, pay extra attention to the surface of the filter, the rubber seals, and the vents on the back of the tray. When you are finished, snap the filter back into place., Turn the Roomba upside down, and locate the side-sweeper: a circular, three-pronged plastic piece at the top left of your Roomba. Using your Phillips screwdriver, remove the single screw that holds the side-sweeper in place, and remove the side-sweeper. Using your hands or your crevice tool, clean off any hair/debris that is attached to the side-sweeper and the place where the side-sweeper attaches., The front wheel--positioned front and center on the bottom of your Roomba--should easily pop out. Use your hands to remove any hair or string attached to the wheel itself. Then use your vacuum with the crevice tool to vacuum the opening where the wheel goes., On the bottom of your Roomba, you will notice a rectangular flap, that should lift open. Under this flap, you'll find your cylindrical brush, which is likely to be very dirty. Lift out this brush., On either end of your brush there will be small bearings. (On many models, these bearings are yellow). Remove these bearings and set them aside. Then, using your hand, pull off any hair that has gotten tangled around the ends of your brush., Take out the iRobot Roomba bristle brush and slide it onto the end of your cylindrical brush. Pull the bristle brush down the length of your cylindrical brush in order to remove hair and debris. Remove the hair/debris from the bristle brush with your fingers, and repeat this process 2-3 more times.An iRobot Roomba bristle brush should have been included with your Roomba. If you have misplaced this item, you can purchase one online for around $5.  Below the the space that held the cylindrical brush, you will see a cylindrical rubber roller. This will slide out. Remove the (yellow) bearings, and pull off any dirt/hair from the ends., Using the brush attachment on your vacuum, go over all sides of the brush and roller to remove dust, dirt, and hair. Set the brush and roller aside, and switch to your crevice tool. Now vacuum the compartment where the brush and roller go, paying careful attention to the gray flap that seals the compartment., You do not need to remove the rear two wheels in order to clean them. Instead, push the left wheel down and use the crevice tool to vacuum around it. Repeat this on the other side., Using your Phillips screwdriver, remove the four small screws that hold the black bottom cover in place. These screws may be a bit difficult to remove. Then slide off the bottom cover and set it aside., Locate the four tiny screws that hold the rectangular motor unit in place, and carefully remove them. Pull the rectangular unit out of the Roomba (on many models this is blue). With the motor compartment removed, run your vacuum crevice tool over the inside of your Roomba.These screws are very small and delicate. Be careful not to strip the tops of them as you remove them, and set them in a safe place.  Using a can of compressed air, carefully work to remove any dust or debris from the motor unit. Pay attention to any crevices and openings.If you do not have compressed air, you can go over the motor with your vacuum crevice tool. However, be very careful not to disturb any wires.  Place the motor compartment back inside the Roomba and secure it with the four tiny screws. Then replace the bottom cover and secure it with its four screws. Pop the front wheel back in place. Next, return the bearings to the rubber roller and brush, and return them to the proper compartment (in that order),and close the flap. Then, replace the side-sweeper and secure it with a single screw. Finally, reinsert the collection tray.	Empty your Roomba. Remove the filter. Vacuum the tray and filter using a regular vacuum and the crevice tool. Switch to the brush tool. Remove the side-sweeper. Remove the front wheel. Remove the brush. Remove the bearings. Use the iRobot Roomba bristle brush. Remove the rubber roller. Vacuum the brush, roller, and compartment. Clean the rear wheels. Remove the bottom cover. Remove the motor unit. Clean the motor with compressed air. Reassemble your Roomba.
This is a good idea because the showers at such festivals are slightly unhygienic and probably cold.; , This will keep it well refrigerated and you don't have to sample any of the fast food stuff! But if greasy spoons (which are quite nice as an occasional treat) are your thing, then take plenty of money because food and drinks there tend to be twice as much as the average KFC where you live.  If kids are coming with you, have them at your side at all times. Children get lost very, very easily at these things and your child/children getting lost can be a very traumatic experience. But if you do get lost, make sure you report it to one of the festival tents; these should be located in several places around the grounds. Also, a good tip is to write your mobile/cell phone number on your child's arm so if someone can ring you if they find your child.  It is a lot safer there than it is around the tent.  12% of A&E emergencies are due to dangerous actions at gigs.  Sunday night is bonfire night, and they might trash or burn your tent! Alternatively, take it down (if it's worth taking down) and leave at a cloakroom or in a car.  Walking back from a gig in the middle of the night can be a real nightmare otherwise!  , Wet clothes can be horrific to wear the next day!  , They will completely wreck your festival experience and you could get very very much in trouble - by the police and getting hurt by using the drugs themselves. ,, Either they're not there or the line is ten thousand miles long.	Take wet wipes for your face. Don't buy lunch, bring it packed in a cool pack. Stay Safe. Make sure all your money is in your wallet, not in your tent. If you're crowdsurfing be very careful. If you are staying until Monday morning (this is possible at Roskilde), don't go too far away from your tent, or at least take all your belongings out of it. Put a brightly coloured ribbon around your tent to know where yours is. Take plenty of dry clothes!, Most importantly do not be tempted to try any drugs regardless of what other people say. Don't get too wasted, you will forget your experience and wake up with a banging hangover :(.  , Keep a mobile (cellphone) with you at all times.  , Never expect an on-site cashpoint. Last but not least, have fun!
Each sewing machine brand is different, so it’s a good idea to check the manual that came with your sewing machine for directions on how to clean and oil the machine.Some manufacturers recommend cleaning the machine after every 10 hours you use it. Clean it when you see lint starting to gather. Some older machines mark the spots where you should drop oil in red. Others tell you where to drop it using pictures to guide you. If you don’t have a copy of the instructional manual, you should be able to get one on the manufacturer’s website. You might even be able to download it. If that doesn’t work, call the manufacturer and ask for one. You will be asked the machine name, model, and serial number most likely. You could also ask a local dealer.Some machines do not need to be oiled. They are self-lubricating. Such a machine will still need to be maintained, but if it says not to oil it at home, don’t.; , You want to make sure that you don’t use too much oil. It’s a good idea to use a little bit of oil, and see how it works. Then use more. Place a piece of newspaper under the machine while you work.   Oil small areas at a time. You should take apart small areas of the machine piece-by-piece to oil them. Study the instructional manual drawings first so that you understand the function and name of each part. Disassemble the parts following the instructions in your manual. You will want to follow a process of cleaning the piece, brushing it out, and then lubricating each area. After you finish with each area of the sewing machine, you will want to put it back together, and then move on to the next part. Replace needles frequently. You will probably want to do this with each new project.  You should clean the machine before you oil it. First, turn off the machine and unplug it.   Remove all of the extra pieces of the machine that will get in the way of a thorough cleaning. For example, remove thread, bobbin cases, plates, and the presser foot. Remove the stitch plate. If your machine has a bobbin hook, you should remove it because lint could be collected there. Remove the machine’s needle for safety purposes.  You should be able to brush away the lint with the stiff lint brush. Brush away the lint that you can. Sometimes these small lint brushes and other cleaning materials will come with the sewing machine.   To reach pieces of lint that are hard to sweep away because they are compacted, try using tweezers to remove them. It's essential that you thoroughly clean your machine before you apply the oil. Try using a soft cloth to wipe away any lint or residue on the bobbin hook. Some people also use clean mascara brushes or pipe cleaners for this process.  You could clean parts of the machine with a can of compressed air. There are some cautions necessary with using compressed air, though.   The problem with canned air is that it could blow lint deeper in the machine. To reduce this problem, hold the nozzle at least 4 inches (10.2 cm) away from the machine part, and spray air at an angle into the machine so it blows the lint out of the machine instead of into it. Use the air to clean the bobbin case area and the bobbin case itself. This is the area where the bobbin loads up. Stray dust should fall out.Use the air to clean the bobbin case also. Clean under the needle plate also. You will have to unscrew the needle plate. Remove the plate. You will see dust inside of it. Spray the area with the compressed air. Clean any other parts as instructed by your sewing machine manual.  You cannot use car oil. You need to buy oil that is specifically for sewing machines. Sewing machine oil is clear and comes in a small bottle.   Your sewing machine may have come with a bottle of oil when you purchased it from the dealer or store. You can find this oil in sewing and fabric shops. This cannot be said enough. You cannot use any other oil than the oil recommended in your owner’s manual. Household oil or WD-40 will not work. Sewing machine oil is of different consistency than oil you’d put in a car. It’s clear and lighter. , You should only need a small amount of oil. Your owner’s manual will tell you where to drop it in the machine. It only takes a couple of drops.   Generally, you will be told to squeeze a few drops of oil on the housing unit that the bobbin case sits in.Most machines want you to oil the shuttle hook (which is the thing that spins inside the bobbin casing). Often you will be told to drop oil inside the hook race and the housing of the sewing machine. That’s the silver ring that the bobbin hook fits into. Your machine will perform better and be quieter if you drop oil here because the two pieces rub together. You may also be instructed to put a drop of oil on the outer ring of the bobbin hook. This is where it slides along the hook race., You could leave a piece of fabric under the presser foot to soak up any excess oil. You don’t want oil to stain your next project when you start stitching.   Take a cloth, and wipe away excess oil. Otherwise, it could end up on your fabric and thread. Put your parts back together. Avoid oiling plastic parts.If you use too much oil, you can run muslin through the machine, and then wipe the exterior of the machine. Use a damp, soapy towel. Let it sit. That way the oil will collect. Then, do it again. You might need to do this a few times over the subsequent days until all of the extra oil is not in the machine. Test the machine. Before you start sewing a new project, make a few stitches on a piece of fabric you don’t care about. You want to see if any excess oil remains. Screw the needle plate back into the sewing machine.  Remove the needle plate. Turn the handwheel towards yourself until the needle is fully raised and open the hinged front cover. Unscrew the needle plate screws. A screw driver will come with the machine.   Clean the feed dog. Remove the bobbin. Use the brush supplied to clean the area. Remove the bobbin case. Snap the two hook retaining arms outwards. Remove the hook cover and the hook. Clean with a soft cloth. Lubricate the points in the instructional manual with 1-2 drops of sewing machine oil. Turn the handwheel until the hook race is in the left position. Replace the hook. Replace the hook cover, and snap back the hook retaining arms. Insert the bobbin case and bobbin and replace the stitch plate.	Follow the instructional manual. Go slowly. Prepare the machine for cleaning. Take a small, stiff lint brush. Use compressed air. Buy sewing machine oil. Put drops of oil into sewing machine parts. Wipe away excess oil. Oil a Singer sewing machine.
Attach the brush accessory to the hose of a vacuum cleaner. Use a medium setting and vacuum up dirt. Alternatively, you could use a brush with soft bristles. Gently sweep up the dirt into a dustpan.   Regardless of which method you use, avoid rubbing the leather too harshly. This could set in the stain.; , Water-soluble substances include coffee, tea, milk, soda, or sugary preserves. Use a clean, dry cloth to blot the spill and absorb the liquid. Work quickly, but be gentle. Then, dampen another cloth with plain water. Start rubbing at the outside of the stain and gradually work your way inward. Use another dry cloth to blot excess water until it's completely absorbed.   Never dry your furniture with a hair dryer. Dry hot air will damage the leather., Use a paper towel to wipe away the substance. Avoid rubbing too hard to prevent the mess from getting ground in to the upholstery. Then, soak one of the cloths in diluted soap with a neutral pH (6.5-7.5). Begin gently rubbing the stain at the outer edge and work your way inward. Finally, dry the wet area with the other cloth. Continue blotting until all the moisture is absorbed. Don't use a hair dryer.Oil-based substances include oils, mayonnaise, chocolate, and ketchup.	Vacuum or brush away solid debris. Remove water-soluble stains with clean cloths and water. Clean oil-based stains with neutral soap.
A bar is simply one line of your song. Most raps are built out of 16 or 32 bar verses though they can be as short as 8 or 12 bars as well. If you're writing the whole song yourself you might have 2-3 verses and a hook. You might also have a short 8-10 bar bridge, which is a short verse with a slightly different beat or structure.You can write your rap without knowing the bars as well. Simply write until you feel like your verse is finished, then edit the beat to fit the desired length.  Raps are written around rhymes. Rhyme connects to lines so that they flow smoothly together, pulling the listener through the song. While all lines of your rap don't need to rhyme, and probably should not, you need to have a firm grasp of rhyme techniques to become a rapper. Luckily, this doesn't require any studying, just an ear for what sounds good to you. Still, it can help to know the different types of rhyme common in rap:    Simple Rhyme: When the last syllables of two lines rhyme, like "Can" and "man." This is the most common and basic form of rhyme.  Multi-syllabic rhyme: One of the best ways to show your lyrical skills is to rhyme multiple syllables at once. This can stretch across multiple words as well, such as Big Daddy Kane in "One Day:" "Ain’t no need for wondering who’s the man/ Staying looking right always an exclusive brand."  Slant Rhyme: Rhyming too closely related, but technically non-rhyming, words. Usually, they have a common vowel sound. This is incredibly common in rap, because how you say/sing the words can make them sound much more similar. Examples include "Nose" and "go," or "orange" and "porridge."Internal Rhyme (In-Rhyme): Rhyming words that do not come at the end of a line but in the middle of it. For example, Madvillains' "Rhinestone Cowboy:" "Made of fine chrome alloy / find him on the grind he's a rhinestone cowboy.", Punchlines are the big lines, jokes, or rhymes that elevate the song from good to great. There are thousands of great examples, but they are mostly a matter of personal preference. To write them, try to think of the punchline first then build the rhyming lines around it.   If your punchline is "I'm stepping over competition, so expect to be trampled," you might try to write a line leading into it that ends with a word rhyming with "trampled." For example, "They see me in the booth so they know they should scramble/ I'm steppin' over competition so expect to be trampled").  A rhyme scheme is simply how the song is structured. The most common way to do this is with alternating couplets, which are two lines that rhyme at the end. The next two lines also rhyme at the end, but with a different set of words. That said, there are many, many ways to write out rhyme schemes, such as alternating (the first line rhymes with the third, and the second with the fourth), or rhyming 4-6 lines with the same word (like the beginning of "Get 'Em High"). The best way to learn is practice.   If you're a rapper that raps with a lot of flow (smooth, quick words) you may want to have every bar end with the same amount of syllables or almost the same amount of syllables. If you're a rapper that raps fast you may want to have lots of internal rhymes in every bar, like " the industry's gettin' clean and I've seen what them haters mean/ if you thought I was lettin' up setting up the terrain was dreamed". If you're a story rapper you can have the first verse be your intro, your second verse your problem, and your last verse your conclusion. To match this, you might play with a different rhyme scheme in every verse to show growth or use a similar one to indicate that there is no growth.  Make sure you mean every word and every word comes from your soul. Let the music come to you. To start writing good lyrics, you should throw on a beat that juices your brain start thinking of some insane rhymes. It's all about the state of mind.   Specifics from real life will always make a better song. The reason Nas' Illmatic is one of the all-time great albums is because it feels lived in, not made up. If you don't have a theme or rhyme scheme yet, just start writing lines that you like. Eventually, these lines will come together to tell a full song, and this can be a great way to practice rhymes. The best rappers are able to tell stories from real life, connecting to their audience's memories and emotions. They are successful not because they tell crazy or unbelievable stories, but because they make a simple story connect with practice and well-written rhymes.	Figure out how many bars you have to rap on. Understand rhyme inside and out. Write "punchline raps" in reverse. Organize your lines into a rhyme scheme. Make sure your song is personal and real.
You will still need remaining string to add the button at the end.  You may want to thread the string through a needle in order to secure the button in place.          Tie a strong knot in the end of the button to ensure it stays in place. Consider threading the string through the button and then tying it in place underneath the button.	Braid the remaining portion of the bracelet and tie a knot toward the end. Thread the button onto the end of the bracelet and tie in place. Finished.
If you are going to be wearing this wreath over a hairstyle (such as for a wedding), get your hair into that style first and then measure your hair. Some hairstyles, such as French braids and braided crowns, can add bulk to your head., Try to use some thicker floral, like the kind that has paper around it. This will help the florist's tape stick better to it. Do not use scissors to cut the wire or you will dull them. Use wire cutters instead.  The ring should hold its shape. If it is too floppy, twist two to three strands of wire together, and make the ring again. This should make it sturdier.  You can also wrap some more tape around the entire wire ring. This will give you a base to work on. It will also make the color more consistent.  Try to cut all the stems down to the same length. This will make the crown neater in the end.   Try using large, medium, and small flowers. This will give your crown some variety.  Don't tape the flowers to the base just yet. You want to get your design down first. It is easier to make changes while the flowers are still on the table. Try alternating between different shapes, sizes, and colors. Here are some more design ideas:   Place the largest flowers in the top/front of the crown. Use smaller and smaller flowers as you go towards the back of the crown. Try having all the flowers pointing in the same direction, towards or away the top of the crown. The flowers don't have to be right up against each other. You can have them spaced as close together or as far apart as you want. Instead of attaching flowers all the way around the wire base, place them only on the top.  Hold the flower against so that the stem is laying horizontally alongside the wire. Wrap some florist's tape around the stem and the wire. Start just below the bloom, and keep wrapping until you are ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) past the end of the stem. Cut the tape and press the edge down to seal it.  Place it so that the bloom overlaps the first flower's. The closer together the two blooms are, the fuller and heavier your crown will look in the end. The further away the blooms are, the thinner and more delicate your crown will look.  Keep working your way around the circle, until you've used up all of the flowers you laid out in the beginning.  Fold several long pieces of ribbon in half and place them just behind the spot where the wires overlap. Leave about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) of the loop just above the wire. Wrap the ribbon ends over the wire and down through the loop. Gently tug on the ribbons to secure them.  If you see any gaps or places where you want it to look more full, gently part the flowers, insert another one and tape it in place.	Measure your head and add 2 inches (5.08 centimeters). Cut a piece of sturdy wire according to that measurement. Make a ring with the wire and overlap the ends by 1 inch (2.54 centimeters). Wrap florist's tape around the overlapping ends to secure them. Choose your flowers and cut the stems down to 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) below the bloom.Use scissors to cut real or dried flowers, and wire cutters to cut fake flowers. Arrange the flowers in a pattern you like. Attach the first flower to the wire base. Lay the second flower just behind first one and secure it with florist's tape. Continue placing and taping the flowers. Consider adding some ribbon. Try on your crown and make any adjustments, if necessary.
To make this costume, you will need:   Sewing supplies Black felt Yellow felt White felt Black hooded sweatshirt Hot glue Dark pants and shoes  , Use sharp scissors to cut both pieces out.   You can freehand sketch the beak pattern, if desired. Note that you need to draw the beak from a side view, rather than a top view. The base should be somewhat rectangular, but the beak itself should appear as a hooked or curved triangular shape. Your beak should be large enough to attach to your sweatshirt and make the hood of the black sweatshirt look like the bird’s head. The size may be dependent on if you are an adult or a kid.  Lay the two beak pieces on top of each other and sew along the top edge. Place the beak on the top of the hood, just above the opening, and sew the base of the beak onto the hood.   Since felt doesn't fray, you do not need to turn the material inside-out as you work. Make sure that your seams are neat and even, however, to prevent the work from looking messy. The beak should be positioned in the center of the hood and should hang over the face area when you put the hood on your head.  For each eye, you will need a yellow circle, a black circle, and a white semi-circle.   The yellow circles should be about 3 inches in diameter. The black circles should be about 2.5 inches in diameter. The white semi-circle should be about 1 inch in diameter.  Lay the black circle on top of the yellow circle, precisely centered. Glue in place. Lay the white semi-circle on top of the black circle so that the flat edge lies in the center of the black circle. Glue in place.   Use fabric glue or hot glue for this. Let dry before pressing on.  Cut off a few individual feathers from your strip of feathered fringe. Turn each eye over to reveal the back, and glue these feathers around about half of each eye.   Note that the feathers should fan out from the side of the eye facing the flat side of your white semi-circular portion.  Position the eyes on either side of the beak on the hood. They should be to the sides of the beak, but above the actual beak base. Fix in place by sewing or gluing them on.   The curved side of the white semi-circles should face inward, toward the beak, and the feathers surrounding each eye should fan out to the sides.  Cut a strip of feathered fringe, out of black felt, long enough to cover the sleeve of your arm, extending from the shoulder seam down to the cuff. Pin and sew in place.   Note that the fringe should point down and out when you put the shirt on. Keep that in mind as you pin and sew. Repeat this process with the other sleeve so that both are covered with black feathered fringe.  Put on some black pants and black shoes. Slip on your feathered black sweatshirt, then pull the hood over your head so that the beak and eyes show. This completes your raven costume.	Gather your materials. Cut out a basic beak pattern.Sketch out two hooked beak halves onto black felt. Sew the beak. Cut out the eye pieces. Piece the eyes together. Glue a few feathers to the back of each eye. Adhere the eyes to the hood. Sew the fringe to the outside of each arm. Put it all together.
Make sure the entire ball is painted yellow. Hang or rest in an egg carton to dry. They must be completely dry before proceeding with the next steps.; ,   Cut long diamonds from the orange felt. You'll need one orange diamond one per bird. Fold in half to create a beak. Keep pinched with your fingers. Glue in place on the fold line/area on the ping pong ball. The triangle edges will stick forward to form the beak shape. Repeat for each chick you're making.  Draw on eyes with the black Sharpie marker.   You can also create eyes with eye stickers, but handmade ones are fast and easy to do, plus you have plenty of creative leeway to make the eye shapes any way you like (try anime style, for example), and with or without eyelashes too. Repeat for each chick you're making.    For each bird being made, cut out two wings from the yellow felt. Cut the wings in a rounded way, not spiky or too textured. Keep the chick looking soft and cute! Glue the wings in place on the sides of the chick. Repeat for each chick you're making.    At the end of each leg, shape the three "toes." You'll need to play around with the balance a little, to be sure that the toes enable the chick to stand.   When finished, glue the legs firmly in place. Allow to dry completely. Paint the legs completely using orange paint. Repeat for each chick you're making.  Place on a tabletop or in a basket. If used as a toy, do not give to children under 3, as the small parts are a safety hazard.	Paint the ping pong balls yellow. Make the beaks. Create eyes. Make the wings for the chick. Shape legs from the wire. Display the finished chicks.
(YouTube guitar lessons are a great way to self teach); , No matter how hard you try, if you don't enjoy learning, it will make it far harder. Play the music you like, most bands have at least a couple beginner songs, so try to play songs that you enjoy playing.  It makes it a lot easier to learn if you play guitar with a buddy, you can compare tips and both play different roles in different songs (providing you have the same taste in music)e.g they could play lead and you could play rhythm, plus it is really fun to play the same song with someone. , 45 minutes to an hour each night is good, but stop if you feel bored or tired. Start fresh the next night(or day). Its also a good Idea to keep your guitar set up so you can just pick it up and play if you have a spare couple of minutes.  Make sure you have a good supply of picks/plectrums (if you are using a pick instead of finger picking)and make sure you always have a spare set of strings in case one snaps (nothing more annoying than not having a string)  , Having a guitar tuner is much better than trying to tune by ear, they are much easier to use and take much less time, it is very annoying if tuning by ear does not work, I was close to smashing a guitar over it.	Learn the basics first: no matter what type of music you want to play or what type of guitar you want to use, you will need to learn some basic chords, they are extremely easy to find on the net and there are many books covering this sort of thing,also, YouTube has tons of videos for this. Make sure you enjoy learning. Find a buddy to play with. Don't get ahead of yourself: The chances are, if a song sounds hard to play, it probably is (not all the time though) so take it slowly, don't try to learn an entire song at once, try to learn a group of five or six chords on a song at a time, if you try to go too fast you'll only get confused and frustrated, then you'll get nowhere.  , Practise regularly: It's a lot easier to practise if you set a certain time to practise. Stock up on supplies. Buy a tuner.
Automobiles average about 12,000 miles a year. For example, if a car is 5 years old but has far fewer than 60,000 miles, the odometer may have been tampered with. Look closely at the numbers on the odometer. Some auto makers program odometers to show an asterisk if the mileage is changed. General Motors mechanical odometers have a black space between the numbers. If you see a white or silver space, the GM odometer probably has been changed.; , If the title is from out of state or brand new, it may be a case of title washing or title fraud, and the mileage given may be false.   Be sure to examine the title's mileage number closely and look for smudging or other tampering. The title should show the mileage in crisp type on a clean background.  Examine the mileage on the receipts and inspection stickers and compare to the odometer. Inspection stickers can be found on door frames or windows.  If the dashboard isn't put together perfectly, the odometer may have been tampered with.  If either is badly worn but the odometer has low mileage, it may be a case of odometer fraud.  A mechanic knows what parts would be original on an older car. For example, a car's odometer may say 30,000 miles. Beware if the car has new parts that ordinarily would not be replaced until 60,000 miles. This may indicate odometer tampering.  If the odometer says 25,000 miles, the car should still have its original tires, with tread deeper than than 2/32 of an inch (1.5875 mm). Ask the mechanic to check tire tread with a depth gauge.   You can check tire tread depth yourself using a penny. Insert the penny into the tread upside down. If Abraham Lincoln's head is partly covered, the tire has more than 2/32 of an inch.	Examine the odometer for the number of miles. Ask the seller to show you the original title, not a duplicate. Ask to see oil change and maintenance receipts and inspection stickers. Look for missing screws on or near the dashboard. Inspect the brake pedal and floor mats. Take the vehicle to a mechanic and ask him to examine the car for wear and tear. Measure the depth of the tread on the car's tires.
After your practice session, you will likely have some rosin, sweat, and grime on your hands which you don’t want to accidentally transfer onto different parts of your violin.; , Cleaning cloths help prevent buildup of rosin and other substances and also keep your violin looking nice by removing fingerprints and other markings. You always want to have at least two soft, clean, lint-free cloths to wipe down the various parts of your violin.   Be sure to keep these cleaning cloths in your violin case so that they’re on hand at all times. You can buy cleaning cloths that are specially made for violin cleaning, such as SHAR or Glaesel, but you can also use what you have, such as flannel. Just be sure you are using a cloth that is soft and non-abrasive.  It is important to wipe down the strings of your violin after each playing session because rosin can quickly accumulate and change the sound of your instrument. This is an easy step that should become a regular habit after practicing.   Using one cloth, wipe the rosin off each individual string, moving up and down each string in a sliding motion. Be sure to wipe off any rosin flakes that might break off during this step. If there is a build-up of rosin on your strings that you cannot wipe off, you can use pure alcohol to remove this. Put a few drops of alcohol on the cloth and rub on the strings, but be careful to ensure that the alcohol does not touch any other part of the violin as alcohol will damage the varnish., Just like on the strings, rosin can build up relatively quickly on the bow. You can use the same cloth you used for the strings as you are wiping away the same substance.   Just as with the strings, simply take the cleaning cloth to wipe down the bow in the direction that the hairs are running in. Do not go against the grain, just wipe up and down using a light touch.  The face of the violin refers to its body, excluding the strings or neck of the violin. You will want to use a different cloth for this step, as you want to avoid rubbing rosin or any other substance onto the violin.   When wiping the F-holes, take care to ensure the cloth does not get caught in them. The woodwork of F-holes is delicate and can change or ruin the sound of the violin if damaged., The bridge of the violin is liable to have collected some rosin during your practice session. Use a cloth to dust the rosin out from under the bridge but maintain a light touch, as the bridge is very fragile.   Try using a Q-tip for those spots that are especially hard to reach.  Having a polished violin keeps the varnish in good shape and also takes care of the gunky build up that inevitably occurs after years of playing any instrument.   If your violin is new or in good shape, you may not need to polish it at all. However, if your instrument is dull and hasn’t been polished in a long time (a year or more), you may want to polish it. Check with your luthier (a specialist in string instruments) if you aren’t sure.  Only use a commercial violin polish rather than furniture polish or water as these can damage both the varnish and sound of the violin.Never use violin cleaners or polishes on master instruments or antiques, because the oils they contain could open a crack and make your instrument difficult to restore.Polishes generally contain some type of oil, which can create fissures in the violin’s wood and damage the instrument in the long run. Therefore, there is some disagreement over whether polishes should be used on violins at all., If you do decide to use polish on your violin, be sure to follow the specific instructions that come with your polish and be careful to only polish the body of the violin.   Apply polish to the cloth, not directly on the instrument. Rub out the smudges, dirt, any rosin buildup, using the cloth. Buff on all sides, but be careful around the F-holes to prevent polish buildup. Then take a separate rag to wipe off any excess polish to prevent moisture from entering in and damaging the violin. Avoid the strings and bridge of the violin as you don’t want any polish building up on these parts and affecting the sound of the instrument.  The oils and sweat on your skin can attack the varnish of your violin and leave marks. The less skin contact you make with your violin, the longer it will last in terms of great sound and appearance.   Practice lifting and holding your violin as little as possible until it becomes second nature to not grab and touch your violin all over its body.  Though people often forget about this step, your violin will not stay clean if its storage case is not clean. Empty and vacuum out your case once a week or once you start seeing flakes of dust, dirt, and rosin.   This step has the added benefit of preventing dust mites that may eat your violin’s bow hair., If you start to notice cracks or other changes in your violin, it’s time to take your instrument into a reputable violin maker or music store.	Wash your hands. Get several cleaning cloths. Wipe down the strings. Wipe the bow. Wipe down the face of the violin. Clean the bridge. Know when to polish your violin. Get the right type of polish. Use a cloth to polish. Limit the places you touch with your hands. Clean your case. Know when it’s time for a professional tune-up.
Hybrid seeds: These are seeds whose parent plants are 2 distinctly different plants that have been crossbred to promote certain desirable traits. These seeds may produce plants that are more disease resistant, produce larger fruit, or have an easier harvest. The disadvantage of this type of garden seed is that many unique genes are lost and attributes such as a unique taste, smell, or texture may not be present in the plants and fruits from hybrid seeds. The seeds collected from hybrid plants may not be suitable to plant for the next year as they may not produce the same type of plants as those they came from. Heirloom seeds: Heirloom seeds come from plants that have not been genetically changed by humans. Heirloom plants and vegetables have distinct smells, tastes, and textures that hybrid seeds may not have. The seeds from these plants will produce the same type of plant they were harvested from. Although heirloom seeds may not have some characteristics bred into them that the hybrid seeds possess, many of these characteristics are not particularly sought after by the backyard gardener. Organic seeds: These seeds come from parent plants that are pesticide-free and organically grown. These seeds may be heirloom or hybrid.; , Mark off the seeds as you find sources for them so you do not double order.  Many seed companies have been in business for many years and take pride in producing quality seeds that have good sprout rates and will produce healthy plants. Look into how long a seed company has been in business and if there are any consumer complaints against them.  Seed packets come with an expiration date printed on them. Make sure you have the current year's seeds. Although expired seeds may sprout, the sprout rate may be less or the plants may not be as healthy as they could be.  The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) provides a map of 11 climate zones in North America that lets gardeners know if the plants of the seeds they are buying for their garden will survive in their part of the country. This can give you a general guidelines to follow when selecting seeds for a garden.  Some seeds need cool weather for germination, such are cabbages, lettuce, and Brussels sprouts. Others prefer warm to hot weather, such as zucchini, corn, and watermelon. Look on the back of your seed packet for the months to achieve the best germination rate for your gardening zone.	Learn the types of seed that are available to plant in your garden. Decide on the types of seeds you want to plant in your garden, and write down a list of them. Buy from a reputable seed company. Check the expiration date on the seed packet at the store or when the seeds arrive in the mail. Choose garden seeds that can be grown in the zone in which you live. Buy garden seeds for the growing season you want to planting in.
You'll need to have long hair. Your hair should come down to about the tip of your nose. You need to wash your hair with shampoo and conditioner. After that, on a cool setting, you need to dry your hair with a hair dryer and brush it with a round brush as you do that. After that's done, and your hair's still a tiny bit wet, use straighteners to straighten your hair. After this, apply product to your hair. Only use a little bit. After that, use industrial strength hairspray. You should use the hairspray upside down so it gets in your roots. Then, put everything in place and spray, then you're done with that.    Get the right jacket. You'll need a brown tweed blazer with two-button closure.It's a good idea to check thrift stores for a match. Add the shirt. The shirt is an expensive one. You could try a regular slim fit dress shirt in either burgundy or cerulean depending on which bow tie you're planning to wear (in series 5, the shirt matched the bow tie and braces). Use black slim fitting dress pants or black jeans. Try to get matching x-back braces and a bow tie. These either come in burgundy or blue. In series 5, the bow tie was a pre tied variety. Try your best to match the boots. The boots are All-saints layer boots. If you can find a cheaper alternative, go for it. Black Doc Martens work nicely - however, they look like they are beaten up and dirtied, so I'd recommend going for that look. Get a brass wrist-watch, with the face on the inside of your wrist. It completes the series five costume.  You'll need to start with his iconic brown tartan jacket, with elbow patches. Alternatively, you could get the green coat he wore in "Let's Kill Hitler", "The Girl Who Waited", "Closing Time", and "The Wedding of River Song". It works for those extra cold days.   The shirts are all in shades of sky blue with white buttons, or white, with a check pattern on the white shirts, and still all fit relatively tight and slim. There are more bow ties, in either burgundy, blue with a horizontal bark pattern, or an Aztec key pattern bow tie. The bow ties are usually self-tie, so learn how to tie a bow tie. There are links to the series 6 bow ties in the tips section. You can take liberties with the boots as long as they're black, however make sure they are clean. Not necessarily shiny, but the whole series 6 outfit was a lot more put together than the series 5 costume.  In series 7, the Doctor's wardrobe changed dramatically as he abandoned his tweed, his braces, and his old TARDIS interior.   His new coat is a purple frock coat. His waistcoat is usually either in light purple, black, or in tweed gray. The boots. Smith's new boots are tan boots that come up to his ankles and lace up, and were light brown in colour. He also wears what appears to be a fob watch (Ah! Remember "Human Nature" and "The Family of Blood" two-parter? Thank you David Tennant-era!) If you want the costume from "The Snowmen" and "The Time of the Doctor," go with a long purple trench coat. They might be hard to find elsewhere, but if you search for actual replica costumes, you can get your hands on one!  , They have a lot of things you could use for the 11th Doctor, If you want, get some weird headwear. Go for a fez or a stetson (preferably a fez). Stetsons are cool.  "Didn't anyone ever tell you? There's one thing you never put in a trap if you're smart. If you value your continued existence, if you have any plans about seeing tomorrow, there's one thing you never, ever put in a trap...Me." - Eleventh Doctor (The Time of Angels, 2010)	Start with the hair for Matt Smith. Put together his series 5 look, if desired. Copy his series 6 look, if you prefer. Mix it up with a series 7 look, if you want. If you want to find a cheap suit for the 11th Doctor, go to Value Village. Add a hat. You're done.

Are you all friends with common interests? Or are you searching for people with a similar vision to perform with? Regardless, make sure that you as performers have equal say in of the creation and progress of your troupe. Troupes that involve every member in the creative process are much stronger in the long run. Not every idea will be used, but approaching each member's opinion with an open, receptive mind will make all the difference.; , Groups of three to five girls are probably big enough in the beginning. As your organization and skill for production improves, you can consider taking on more performers. Remember, the smaller the group, the easier it is to coordinate rehearsal times, workshops and show dates.  Your road will be easier if you have this. Remember, it is incredibly important to have similar goals in mind when sourcing performers. Are you looking to tour, or are you rooted in one area? Is forming a troupe a potential business venture, or a simply hobby? It is important to have a uniting theme that ties performers in as members of the troupe, but variety is the spice of life. Showcasing each performer's individual talent is much more important than forcing conformity.  Are there any 'newbie' nights in your area for upcoming performers? Do you have friends/families that would let you do a private show and build up your set lists? Offering to stage kitten or help out at established shows can also be a foot in the door, though you should not presume to be asked to perform simply after selling a bit of merchandise!  , A good rule of thumb is to operate for 6 months to 1 year and see what your financial situation is like and whether you want to consider this professionally. Talk to a business mentor or a tax representative to be sure.  Even if you are only really a hobby group, think business wise. Create a brief business plan - think about how you are going to market yourself and make yourself individual. Check out your competitors and analyze, with an objective mind, what their strengths and weaknesses are and how your group will compare.  Most successful businesses and groups have an online presence. The more places you are online and the more searchable you are the better success you will have at being hired. Facebook, Twitter and Instagram are all excellent. As far as creating a website, there are several free website builders with easy templates to help you get started. Make sure you create an email address specifically for your group to protect both your privacy and your inbox capacity!  , While on the subject of websites and emails, there is very little point getting online if you don't have photos or images to showcase your group. You only need a small budget and a little bit of imagination to get some great photos. Get a friend that is camera savvy and can take a good snap or offer TFP for emerging amateur photographers. Local photography forums may offer a step in the right direction. If you're inclined, you might only need to scout some good locations or invest some lighting and a backdrop to get a few good photos.  What sort of image do you want to have? This might evolve and change over the years, but in your initial stages what kind of look do you want? It comes back to your ideas about what burlesque is and what style you want to perform. Classic? Neo? You can get great costumes by perusing a local costume store, vintage or second hand stores, or online. Or if you have an act prepared, try getting some staged shots of it. Most importantly make sure the photos represent your group in a concise, creative way.  It's likely you will all have your own ideas for acts and costumes so keep that very collaborative. That aside, work out your own strengths and weaknesses. Find someone that has time to deal with everyday emails/Facebook inquiries. You may find local artists willing and able to help create promotional material as well. Keeping each member of the troupe engaged in the building of a recognizable identity is important, so make sure everyone has a voice!  , Build alliances with other performers. It's unlikely you will be able to run a show from start to finish with fewer than five members. Keep in mind, each act is typically 3-5 minutes long. Add comedians, MCs, dancers, actors, musicians to your friend list on Facebook. Keep a track of performers in your local area. Check out their shows and introduce yourself. Always keep a business card handy! You never know what may come of a chance run in.  There's no need to stress. Keeping a light, positive attitude will ensure that everyone enjoys each step of the process. You may not be a Dita Von Teese, Immodesty Blaize or Kitten De Ville overnight, but keep in mind, neither were they! If you ever begin to feel as though the stress of producing shows and organizing other performers is too great, then solo performance may be the route for you. But overall make sure you behave professionally, explore the history of this incredible art form and have fun!	Start by thinking about how you are bringing this troupe together. Keep it small. Make sure you all have similar interests and a shared vision. Start finding out about possible performance opportunities. Think about whether or not you will need to set up a business name/ABN etc. Operate with a business mentality. Get online. Photos. Come up with a theme for your group. Organisation can be tricky, especially managing schedules of different performers. Network. Have FUN!
; , Tomatoes favor a more acidic soil with a pH of 6.2 to 6.8. Use a pH soil testing kit, available at home improvement and garden stores, to test the pH levels of the soil. , Using a trowel or shovel, move the soil while it is dry. Working with wet soil will make it difficult to move and aerate, and it will stick to your tools. If soil pH conditions aren't ideal for growing tomato plants, add fertilizer to prepare your soil for planting.  Apply peat moss, compost or manure to the soil to improve its quality. Mix in small amounts of any or each of these components as you dig and mix your soil prior to planting. The richer the soil, the better the growing conditions.  Tomato plants require being set deeply in the soil, up to their first leaves. , Dissolve 2 tbsp. (30 ml) of fertilizer into 1 gallon (3.8 liters) of water. Apply 1 cup (240 ml) of the solution to the base of each tomato plant. For larger areas, apply 2 lbs. (907 g) of fertilizer per 100 square feet.	Choose a soil for planting your tomatoes that is well drained, deep and loamy (rich with sand, silt and clay). Test the soil's acidity. Choose an area where the soil receives at least 6 hours of direct sunlight.  , Work the soil to prepare it for planting. Supplement the soil. Choose an area where the soil is deep. Purchase a fertilizer with a 5-10-5 ratio of nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium.  , Prepare the fertilizer.
For best results, make sure the actual card is twice the height of the envelope and the pop up shape one half the height of it. A pop up that's too big will prove cumbersome and hard to manage.   Scrapbook paper makes for good greeting card material. Cardstock works well, too -- just make sure your crease is straight and firm.; , Give it a firm crease with your fingernail or a ruler's edge. Make sure it's straight!         , Make these about 1 inch (2.5 cm) long. The cut should be made in from the folded edge of the card in order to make a flap. You can make your cuts deeper or more widely spaced if you wish; take into account the size of your pop up. A bigger pop up needs a bigger flap.          If you don't like the fact that there's now a gaping hole in your card, cover it up! Take a piece of paper, cut it to size, fold it in half, and voila! You now have a border for the edge of your card. Problem solved.  Fold the flap over on to the front, then fold it on to the back of the card. Open the card and push the flap up toward you. Pinch the middle to crease it.  It could be a picture of a gift, a name, a heart, a part of a photograph, or anything that takes your fancy. Cut out your pop-up shape and glue it on to the front of the pop-up - i.e., the part that is vertical when the bottom, inside portion of your card is flat against the table and the card is open. Allow the glue plenty of time to dry.          For this part, it's best to use a glue stick. You don't want a soggy mess being made of you and the card.  Write your message, put it inside the envelope and give it to your intended recipient. They'll love it!   If you have ribbon, glitter, stickers, stamps, or any scrapbooking materials around the house, use them!	Cut out a rectangular piece of the colored paper. Fold it in half, short sides together. Make two cuts. Crease the pop-up. Decide what you want to pop up. Finish the card.
Lighter colors occupy less visual weight, opening up the room. Use glass and thin-legged tables so the eye can see straight through to the floor, making it virtually invisible. Avoid dark stains, woods, or colors as they have a heavy effect, constricting the room.   Design with a cool eye in mind, but adding bright, warmer colors as accents. In general, cooler colors recede, letting the room take center stage -- so that wood floor shouldn't be stained any darker than it already is. Keep the colors to three or less, however; if you're a texture-lover, go monochromatic.; , It's so easy to think about the square footage of a room and completely forget that there's way more to it than that: just look up. If you can get the eye to move up from the floor, you're good to go. Get a tall, simple floor lamp or vase, full-length curtains, and hang your paintings and mirrors the tall way.   This goes for furniture, too. Often streamlined furniture takes up less space but offers all the beauty and comfort of a curved piece.  If your room is small, choose furniture that matches. Go for chairs that take up less space (without arms or thinner legs), loveseats, ottomans, etc. At the end of the day, there will be more space in the room. Consider a bench as opposed to a conventional coffee table; but if a table is more you, go for a glass or lucite one.   However, too many small objects will make it look cluttered. Just because you have smaller objects doesn't permit you to have more of them. Think of it like dieting -- eating a dozen low-fat Popsicles isn't a good idea, even though they're low-fat. Having a dozen small shelves is furniture overkill.  If you have a dark wood floor, this is an especially good idea. A large print carpet, ideally with lines, will open up your space, in addition to brightening it up.   It does not have to take up the entirety of your room. Just a large rug that accompanies the main pieces of furniture will accomplish what you're looking for.  Start seeing double. An oversized ottoman in the center of the seating area can serve as a coffee table with a decorative tray added, while the piece can also double for extra seating. Or, trade a coffee table for a woven trunk with storage space inside.However, when choosing your tables, opt for ones that have wide open legs. Being able to "see through" the furniture makes the room seem larger to the eye.  Select smaller, portable pieces that can be rearranged. Three small end tables grouped as a coffee table are easy to sprinkle around the room to open up traffic flow when entertaining or to clear space for children to play.Utilize the space beneath tables and slide pieces in and out at your leisure. A decorative basket can be seen but still used as storage and taken out when needed.	Choose light colors. Think in lines. Scale down your furniture. Get a large print carpet. Get multifunctional furniture. Choose portable pieces.
Cover the entire work area with wax paper.  Resin drips and splashes will be very difficult to remove, so it's best to avoid the problem completely. You should also protect yourself by wearing rubber or plastic gloves and safety goggles. Always work in a well-ventilated area. Open windows and run fans to prevent the fumes from building up. If you have breathing difficulties, you may even want to wear a respirator designed to block or filter strong fumes.; , Get creative. You can use flat two-dimensional objects and more elaborate three-dimensional objects. Just make sure that your intended arrangement will fit inside the resin mold or bezel.  Popular ideas include broken or re-purposed jewelry, flowers, glitter, sprinkles, transparencies with words printed on them, scraps of fabric, scraps of ribbon, and decorative scrapbook paper. Some objects may not work as well as others, though. For instance, cured resin obscures the facets of loose crystal gems, causing them to disappear inside the piece., Coat the top, bottom, and sides of all porous embellishments with Mod Podge or a similar clear sealant. Let the sealant dry before using the embellishments.Porous embellishments include all papers and fabrics. If you skip this step, these embellishments may discolor. They can also cause more air bubbles to appear in the resin.  When using transparencies and papers, make sure that the size of the piece precisely matches the dimensions of your mold or bezel., Bezels are easiest to work with since you don't need to remove the resin after it cures, but molds give you greater flexibility in design.  Bezels are empty, open-ended charm settings. Once you pour the resin in and let it cure, the piece is finished and ready to attach to a chain. Molds will only allow you to shape the resin. You will need to take additional steps to turn the resin into a pendant or charm before using it as such. Make sure that any molds you use are labeled specifically for use with resin.  If you decide to use a mold, you need to spray the mold with mold release product. Let the mold release dry before continuing.  Do not spray bezels with mold release. Mold release makes it easier for you to remove the finished resin pieces. Since the resin is supposed to stay inside the bezel, you'll want it to remain stuck in place as firmly as possible.  If you decide to use a bezel, cut a piece of thick, sturdy packing tape and carefully stick it onto one side of the bezel.  Make sure that the tape is secure and that there are no gaps between it and that side of the bezel. This is not necessary if you are using a mold or if the bezel is already closed on one side. Only follow this step if you are using a bezel with two open sides.  For best results, choose polyurethane casting resin, not polyester casting resin.Polyester resin is more toxic and tends to retain an odor even after the pieces harden. To make the process easier, you should also make sure that the resin you buy is mixed in a one-to-one ratio with its catalyst.  Fill a small bowl with hot tap water and rest the two bottles inside, keeping the contents of the bottles submerged beneath the level of the water.  Do not use boiling water. Warming the resin and catalyst in this manner makes it easier to mix the two components smoothly. It also reduces the likelihood of dealing with air bubbles.  Combine the resin and catalyst in a small plastic measuring cup, adding equal parts of each. Stir continuously for two minutes using a wooden stick.  Follow the instructions that come with your resin for this step. Some resins may require more or less stirring time. Only mix as much resin as you expect to use. It will not stay in its liquid form for long, so if you make too much, it'll go to waste. Pour the resin in first, then follow it with an equal amount of the catalyst. Use a graduated measuring cup and measure out both components directly inside the cup. Old, clean cough syrup measuring cups work very well for this, but any graduated measuring cup should suffice. Make sure that you use a cup you don't mind sacrificing, though. It can be reused for other resin projects, but you should not reuse this measuring cup for food, drink, or medicine purposes. Stir slowly to prevent air bubbles from building up. Scrape the stick along the edges and bottom of the cup as you stir to ensure thorough, even mixing.  If you want to create clear resin jewelry, no color pigment is needed. If you want to give each piece a tint of color, however, now is the time to add the pigment.Add liquid colors one drop at a time, stirring after each addition. Combine dry pigments with a little resin in a separate cup first, then combine the colored solution with the rest of the clear resin.  Pour enough of the liquid resin mix into the mold or bezel to completely cover the bottom.Work slowly to reduce the number of air bubbles.  Hold a hair dryer or heat gun roughly 4 inches (10 cm) above the resin for a minute or so. Any air bubbles trapped inside should rise to the surface and pop.  Even though you'll be adding another layer of resin later, it's best to remove the air bubbles in this layer now instead of waiting until the end.  Wait 15 minutes or so, allowing the resin in your mold to harden slightly. Carefully place heavy three-dimensional objects on top of the bottom layer using tweezers.  The bottom of the mold or bezel will be the front of your piece, so place the items in upside-down. By placing the heavy embellishments in between layers of resin, you help hold them in place. If you added them without using layers, the pieces would likely move around before the resin sets.  Pour additional resin over the heavy embellishments, covering them completely.  This layer of resin should reach the top of the bezel or mold. You may need to adjust the position of your embellishments with a toothpick if they shift during this time.  If you want a glittery background, sprinkle the glitter over the top of the mold or bezel after filling it with your final layer of resin.  Glitter is small and light, so it should float on the surface of the resin as it dries. Since the top will later become the back of the piece, the glitter will create a background.  If you plan to add any transparencies, dip them in a little leftover resin before placing them in the mold.  Use tweezers to dunk the transparency into the leftover resin in your measuring cup. Quickly dry the resin with your heat gun or hair dryer. Coating the transparencies will help reduce the risk of air bubbles forming between them and the resin in your mold. The bottom of your mold or bezel will end up being the front of your piece, so place the transparency in upside-down.  As before, use your hair dryer or heat gun to gently bring any air bubbles to the surface, where they can pop., If you plan to use a paper background, use tweezers to carefully place the paper over the top of the resin, aligning it as evenly as possible with the opening of the mold or bezel.  Make sure that the paper is upside-down when you place it in so that the decorative side shows from the front of the piece.  Set the filled mold or bezel aside and cover it with a clean box. Allow the resin to cure overnight.  It is important to cover the resin as it cures to protect it from dust or other debris. Curing times can vary, so you'll need to follow the manufacturer's instructions. Only cure it long enough for the resin to be touchable. Do not wait until the resin is fully cured.  Once cured, you should be able to pop the resin pieces out of their molds using your fingers.  If the pieces are still too soft to remove, try placing the mold in your freezer for 10 minutes. That should make it easier to pop the finished pieces out. At this point, the resin piece is ready to work with, but you'll need to take additional steps before you can wear it as jewelry.  If you used a bezel instead of a mold, you will need to peel off the tape from the back of the bezel once the resin cures.  Do not remove the resin from the bezel. At this point, the resin charm is complete and ready to use as wearable jewelry.  Grab the eye of an eye pin with pliers and carefully heat the metal over the flame of a candle or gas stove. Only heat the metal for about 5 seconds.  Work carefully to prevent accidental burns. Use an eye pin that is just a little shorter than the width of the resin piece.  Grab the resin piece with one hand and carefully poke the straight side of the heated eye pin inside.  Press the pin in until it extends roughly halfway through the resin piece. This will only work if the resin is only partially cured. If you allowed it to cure completely, it will be too hard and unyielding.  Once the metal eye pin is cool enough to touch with your bare fingers, slide a small jump ring into the eye.  This completes the project and turns your resin piece into a wearable pendant or charm.  Apply quick hold contact adhesive to the top of the ring mount or pin backing. Press the mount or backing over the center back of your resin piece.  Work quickly to prevent the adhesive from setting before it's attached to the resin. Keep the mount or backing as centered as possible.  Follow the adhesive manufacturer's instructions and let the adhesive set completely.  This step completes the project and turns your resin piece into a wearable ring or brooch.	Prepare your work space. Find embellishments to add. Apply sealant to porous embellishments. Trim everything down to size. Determine whether to use molds or bezels. Coat molds with mold release. Give the bezel a backing. Choose the right type of resin. Place the resin and catalyst bottles in hot water. Combine equal parts resin and catalyst. Add color pigments, if desired. Pour a layer of resin in. Remove any air bubbles. Let the resin harden slightly before adding heavier embellishments. Cover with a final layer of resin. Add glitter, if desired. Coat transparencies in resin before adding them. Remove any air bubbles. Add any paper backgrounds. Let the resin cure. Remove the resin charms from their molds. Remove the backing from bezels. Heat a metal eye pin. Poke the metal into the resin charm. Attach a jump ring to the loop. Glue the mount to the back of the resin. Let dry.
Tallow wax is usually made from beef suet, the fat located next to the cow's kidneys and liver. Suet is mostly clean of gristle and other animal bits.          You can buy an animal fat other than beef suet, but the process might be messier, and it could smell. The process of making wax from suet is time-consuming, so you may want to make a lot at once. Five pounds of fat makes a good amount of wax; buy more if you need more wax, or cut it down if you don't want that much.; , The suet will be melted down, and that process is much faster when you start with fat that is ground, rather than melted whole or in large chunks.  Ask the butcher to grind the fat for you if you are unable to buy it ground. You can grind the fat at home in a grinder or a food processor. Grind it as fine as possible, since smaller bits of fat melt the fastest.	Buy animal fat. Grind the fat.
Evacuation may be the only way to protect your family in a wildfire. Know where to go and what to bring with you. You should plan several escape routes in case roads are blocked by a wildfire.    Make a disaster plan for your family.  Prepare your family for an emergency evacuation.  Prepare an emergency plan for your pets.; , Are roads leading to your property clearly marked? Are the roads wide enough to allow firefighting equipment to get through? Is your house number visible from the roadside?  , All vegetation is fuel for a wildfire, though some trees and shrubs are more flammable than others. To reduce the risk, you will need to modify or eliminate brush, trees and other vegetation near your home. The greater the distance is between your home and the vegetation, the greater the protection. If you live on a hill, extend the zone on the downhill side. Fire spreads rapidly uphill. The steeper the slope, the more open space you will need to protect your home. Swimming pools and patios can be a safety zone and stone walls can act as heat shields and deflect flames. In this zone, you should also do the following:   Remove vines from the walls of the house. Move shrubs and other landscaping away from the sides of the house. Prune branches and shrubs within 15 feet (4.6 m) of chimneys and stove pipes. Remove tree limbs within 15 feet (4.6 m) of the ground. Thin a 15-foot space between tree crowns. Replace highly flammable vegetation such as pine, eucalyptus, junipers and fir trees with lower growing, less flammable species. Check with your local fire department or garden store for suggestions. Replace vegetation that has living or dead branches from the ground-level up (these act as ladder fuels for the approaching fire).  Cut the lawn often keeping the grass at a maximum of 2 inches (5.1 cm). Watch grass and other vegetation near the driveway, a source of ignition from automobile exhaust systems. Clear the area of leaves, brush, evergreen cones, dead limbs and fallen trees.  This zone should begin about 30 feet (9.1 m) from the house and extend to at least 100 feet (30.5 m). In this zone, focus solely on reducing or replacing as much of the most flammable vegetation as possible. If you live on a hill, you may need to extend the zone for several hundred feet to provide the desired level of safety.    Install electrical lines underground, if possible Ask the power company to clear branches from power lines. Avoid using bark and wood chip mulch  Stack firewood 100 feet (30.5 m) away and uphill from any structure.       Store combustible or flammable materials in approved safety containers and keep them away from the house. Keep the gas grill and propane tank at least 15 feet (4.6 m) from any structure. Clear an area 15 feet (4.6 m) around the grill. Place a 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) mesh screen over the grill. Always use the grill cautiously but refrain from using it all during high risk times.  Any porch, balcony or overhang with exposed space underneath is fuel for an approaching fire. Overhangs ignite easily by flying embers and by the heat and fire that get trapped underneath. If vegetation is allowed to grow underneath or if the space is used for storage, the hazard is increased significantly. Clear leaves, trash and other combustible materials away from underneath sun decks and porches. Extend 1/2-inch mesh screen from all overhangs down to the ground. Enclose wooden stilts with non-combustible material such as concrete, brick, rock, stucco or metal. Use non-combustible patio furniture and covers. If you're planning a porch or sun deck, use non-combustible or fire-resistant materials. If possible, build the structure to the ground so that there is no space underneath.  Like porches and balconies, eaves trap the heat rising along the exterior siding. Enclose all eaves to reduce the hazard.  Any attic vent, soffit vent, louver or other opening can allow embers and flaming debris to enter a home and ignite it. Cover all openings with 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) or smaller corrosion-resistant wire mesh. If you're designing louvers, place them in the vertical wall rather than the soffit of the overhang.  Chimneys create a hazard when embers escape through the top. To prevent this, install spark arrestors on all chimneys, stovepipes and vents for fuel-burning heaters. Use spark arrestors made of 12-gauge welded or woven wire mesh screen with openings 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) across. Ask your fire department for exact specifications. If you're building a chimney, use non-combustible materials and make sure the top of the chimney is at least two feet higher than any obstruction within 10 feet (3.0 m) of the chimney. Keep the chimney clean.  Use fire resistant materials in the siding of your home, such as stucco, metal, brick, cement shingles, concrete and rock. You can treat wood siding with UL-approved fire retardant chemicals, but the treatment and protection are not permanent.  Windows allow radiated heat to pass through and ignite combustible materials inside. The larger the pane of glass, the more vulnerable it is to fire. Dual- or triple-pane thermal glass, and fire resistant shutters or drapes, help reduce the wildfire risk. You can also install non-combustible awnings to shield windows and use shatter-resistant glazing such as tempered or wireglass.  This will serve as a temporary water source if the water is shut off. See our articles on building water features.  Use fire-resistant materials when building, renovating, or retrofitting structures. Avoid designs that include wooden decks and patios. Use non-combustible materials for the roof. The roof is especially vulnerable in a wildfire. Embers and flaming debris can travel great distances, land on your roof and start a new fire. Avoid flammable roofing materials such as wood, shake and shingle. Materials that are more fire resistant include single ply membranes, fiberglass shingles, slate, metal, clay and concrete tile. Clear gutters of leaves and debris. You should also contact your local fire department, forestry office, emergency management office or building department for information about local fire laws, building codes and protection measures. Obtain local building codes and weed abatement ordinances for structures built near wooded areas.	Be ready for an emergency evacuation. Determine your community's ability to respond to wildfire. Create a 30-foot safety zone around the house. Create a second zone at least 100 feet (30.5 m) around the house. Clear all combustibles within 30 feet (9.1 m) of any structure. Remove debris from under sun decks and porches. Enclose eaves and overhangs. Cover house vents with wire mesh. Install spark arrestors in chimneys and stovepipes. Use fire resistant siding. Choose safety glass for windows and sliding glass doors. Prepare for water storage; develop an external water supply such as a small pond, well or pool. Keep the following guidelines in mind at the time of construction or remodeling:   Choose locations wisely; canyon and slope locations increase the risk of exposure to wildland fires.
Carnation plants can be rejuvenated by splitting their root masses into separate plants. To do this, dig up an older carnation plant and use your hands to separate it into two. Replant the divided parts and give them a good watering.   You should not let the plant dry out until it is established.  Carnations grow well from cuttings. You may find that a cutting is a good way to replace plants once they are past their prime, which is usually when they reach two to three years of age. It’s important to only propagate from healthy ‘parent’ plants. To make a cutting:   Cut a non-flowering piece of one of your plant’s shoots. Try to do this first thing in the morning if you can. This cutting should be about four inches long.       Cut below a leaf node using a very sharp, clean blade. The shoot should be recent growth from the same year. Remove the lower leaves.       Dip the cut into a rooting hormone and then plant it halfway down a planter that has been filled with coarse sand.       Water, then place a clear plastic bag around the plant.       Place this in a bright spot out of direct sunlight, such as a window ledge that does not get full sun. Maintain moisture until the plants are established and you can see growth.  Carnations can also be propagated by a method called ‘layering’. To do this, prepare the soil around the plant you wish to propagate as you would for planting a cutting (mixing in sand to compost or peat, then watering the area).Next:   Find a healthy side shoot and strip off the lowest leaves. Halfway along the length make a vertical slit in the stem with a sharp knife.       Bend the stem over and plant the cut midsection into the ground. A good tip is to use a bit of wire or a hairpin to anchor it in the soil. It will eventually root from the cut bit of the stem.       Keep the soil moist for about six weeks, then you can cut it from the parent. Leave it for another month before relocating it.	Try dividing your carnations to rejuvenate and propagate your plant. Consider trying to take cutting of your plant if you’d rather not divide it. Try layering to propagate your carnations.
Theses damping materials absorb sound waves, eliminate resonance, and diminish vibrations.   Damping mats: These are simple to install damping materials and are used to cover panels in your car to help with sound deadening. They are typically made of either stryene-butyadine rubber or asphaltic panes with adhesive backing and either lower the resonant frequency of the panel, or transform the sound vibrations into heat depending on the damping material used in your particular mats. Sprays: These come in either professional cans requiring compressors and paint guns for application or easy to use aerosol cans. Sprays are used in situations where matting would be too bulky to fit or the weight of the matting would be too heavy such as door panels or kick panels. Foams: Foams come in either sheet or spray form. The foam sheets are used just as the damping mats are by laying them over car panels to absorb vibration. Instead of converting the vibrations to heat, as the mats do, the foam sheets dispersing the energy throughout the sheet. Insulation: This damping material is a thick pane of fibers that absorb sound and is laid underneath the carpet. The most typical type of insulation is jute or micro jute. Although insulation is less effective in regard to sound deadening, is does add thermal insulation to the interior of your car as well as creates a plusher carpet  , This will help with the panel's tendency to vibrate causing unwanted noise. , The mats contain metal foil backing in order to increase the mat's heat resistance making them able to be near the heat of the engine. Apply them using a contact adhesion glue found at your local auto shop.	Choose damping materials in which you plan to dampen your car with such as mats, foams, sprays, or insulation; it is recommended to use a combination of these products in order to achieve maximum damping. Add weight to panels using damping mats. Place the damping mats between 2 of the door panels that are in close proximity to each other, to help reduced the vibrations within the space between the 2 door panels.  , Place the damping mats inside an engine compartment to reduced rattling noises.
For the optimum security, your home needs to be outfitted with strong deadbolts and door locks to keep your stuff and your family safe. You can do this yourself, as door locks are easy and inexpensive to replace. Once you do, always lock them and instruct your family to always lock them.   It's possible that older residents likely have kept a copy of your key, so it's good to change the locks if you've just moved in, to help prevent theft.; , Having an alarm reduces the likelihood of a break-in, and makes the effects of a break-in much more minor. You can engage the alarm when you're away, as well as setting it to night or stay mode, for your own safety while you're in for the night. Invest in a system that will alert the police (or fire station) immediately and your home phone should receive a call from them asking if everything is all right.   Shop around for the best monthly monitoring prices. The brands you probably know from television cost four times per month more than other companies that are probably local to you. Knowing the pricing of other companies will help you negotiate a lower rate. Be sure to use the alarm each time you go out, and change the code every year or two, using something hard to guess but easy to remember for the code. If the alarm company offers signs for windows or lawn, use them. The whole idea is to make your home less attractive for an easy theft.  You can help prevent theft at your home by putting a clear thick window film on your ground floor and basement windows to keep them from breaking-in. There are clear, frosted and reflective (mirrored) films, depending on your privacy needs. This is commonly used in earthquake country to prevent shattering, and is also useful to resist a break-and-enter type of theft.  Help your neighborhood by getting to know the cars and habits of your neighbors. This may seem like a little thing, but thieves really do target places where they think they are blending in or not noticed. Once they know someone is very aware of them, they will feel uncomfortable and will quickly move on. As you probably can't be home all the time, this works best if you can encourage your neighbors to do the same.   If you see someone strange or a strange vehicle near your house, go out and offer to help them with directions (pretend to think that they are lost) or otherwise engage them "how are you, how is your day." Be polite and never challenge them ("what are you doing here") as a confrontation could be a risk to safety. A thief will talk as little as possible and then move on to the next neighborhood.  If they arrive at your door, go outside to talk with them, locking your door behind. Many thieves use some excuse to come into the home to get some idea of what to steal. Going outside will help deter them. If they ask, politely say no.   If they claim to be from your town government, ask to see ID first and take their picture using your mobile phone. A real government official won't be upset by this and may even congratulate you on being safe. Always document strangers who come around or seem suspicious in some way. Take a quick picture just to have it in case something happens in the future.  Dogs, even small dogs and docile animals, can help to deter theft. Thieves don't want to mess with potential dog-alarms and bites. If you're concerned about security at your home, consider investing in a family pet who will have the added benefit of barking its head off any time someone comes around with ill intent. This can help you feel safe and provide you with an added layer of security.  Be sure to put away bicycles, radios or anything of value away when you're not using them or done for the day to reduce their visibility to the passerby. Expensive tools, shoes and other things should never be left out where they could be easily taken.  Never leave coins, paper money, wallets, radios, mobile phones or computers visible through the windows of your car. Take them inside and store them properly. This can encourage vehicle theft, and possibly more.  There's no need to broadcast that you've got a big plasma screen television inside and a new Macbook sitting on your desk. Thieves will be much less interested in gambling with what you've got inside if they can't see it. There's no sense in drawing attention to what you've got.  If you are one of the lucky ones with a garage and you keep anything like tools, bicycle or expensive vehicles in it, keep it closed most of the time to prevent anyone passing by taking mental inventory of what you have as incentive to possibly break in later.  Increase night visibility around your home by employing outdoor lighting. Modern LEDs are waterproof and use much less wattage than conventional outdoor lighting.  Consider removing any bushes that are growing against the home providing hiding spots. If you have a fence, keep the gates closed and put up no trespassing signs, which suggests to thieves that you're taking security seriously.  Don't publish personal information such as your telephone number, address, and detailed lists of things you own and your daily activity. If you let everyone know you're out of the town for three days, your new stereo could become an attractive theft option.   If you post a picture in the place you live, be careful not to let the GPS turned on, so everybody will find out where you live.	Change your home's exterior door locks. Consider getting an alarm system installed. Have anti-shatter plastic installed on your windows. Keep an eye out for your neighbors. Never invite strangers into your home. Get a dog. Keep things inside. Take things out of your car. Keep your blinds closed. Keep your garage door closed. Keep your home well-lit. Eliminate hiding spots around your home. Be careful on the Internet.
The tins that cookies come in a perfect for this. If you cannot find such a tin, arts and crafts stores sell very similar ones.  Wash the box with soap and warm water, and dry it off. If you plan on painting the box, wipe it down with a cotton ball soaked with rubbing alcohol. This will get rid of any oil residue that might prevent paint from sticking.   This would be a good idea even for store-bought boxes that never held cookies.  The designs on a cookie tin can give your sewing box some old-fashioned charm, but you can paint it if you don't like the design or color. Take the lid off the box, and spray paint both with a primer. Wait for the primer to dry, then spray paint it using your favorite color. If you need to apply a second coat, wait for the first one to dry before applying it.   Try to apply the primer and paint lightly. It is better to do many light coats than one thick coat. Thick coats are more likely to create drips and puddles. Avoid painting the inside of the box. The paint will get scratched off by the objects inside.  You will be using these measurements to make your grid.  Try to use a stiffer or thicker cardboard for this; it will be more durable and less likely to lose its shape.  You can match the color to the outside of the box, or use a completely different color for contrast.  Find the center of each strip. Cut a notch halfway into the strip. The notch should be about the same thickness as the cardboard you are using. This will give you four large compartments.   If you want more compartments, cut more strips of cardboard and more notches. You will need to trim down some of the strips in order to fit them inside the box.  Form a cross with the strips. Make sure that the notches are facing each other, then slide them into place. If your grid is too wobbly, draw a line of glue along the seams. This will strengthen it. Try to use a liquid glue that dries clear.  If you want to glue it down, draw a line of glue along the bottom and side edges, then slide the grid into place. To make it stronger, draw a line of glue along the seams.   If you gave your divider more compartments, you will need to cut them shorter until the divider fits inside the box.  The box will be too small to store large items, such as scissors, but it is perfect for smaller items, such as ribbon, thread, and needles. Consider storing like items with like items. For example:   Place your needles, sewing pins, and pin cushions in the first compartment. Place your ribbon, lace, and hem tape in the second compartment. Put the buttons, hooks, and clasps in a third compartment. Use the last compartment for zippers and elastic. For ideas on what to fill your box with, click here.  Because your box doesn't have a clasp, adding a handle would be a bad idea, but you can still make the box look pretty on top. Glue on some sewing-related embellishments on the lid, such as buttons and pretty brooches. Decorate the sides with lace and ribbon.	Find a round, metal tin. Clean the box, then paint it. Consider painting the box. Measure the inside height and diameter of the box. Cut two strips of cardboard according to that measurement. Paint the cardboard strips, or cover them with fabric or paper. Cut a notch into the cardboard strips. Put the strips together. Put the divider into the box. Fill the box. Consider decorating the lid of your box.
For this project, you will need thirty or more pieces of plain white paper, tape, scrap paper or newspaper, construction paper or thin poster board in the color of your choice, scissors, and ordinary glue in a squeeze bottle. You will need a flat surface to work on. Because you are using glue, you may want to cover your surface in newspaper before beginning.   If you want to decorate your shield, you’ll also need markers, paint, stencils, glitter, or any other decorating materials. Keep in mind that this specific shield is made entirely out of paper products, so there may be better DIY options for anyone looking for an extremely sturdy, polished shield.; , You will want to create about thirty in total. These tubes will create the width of the shield. This requires slow and steady work, so take your time! This step will probably be the most time-consuming step of this craft.Start at the corner of the paper, and roll diagonally. Roll it tightly, so that it ends up about the width of a chopstick. Once you’ve rolled the paper completely, tape down the remaining loose corner. This will require about thirty sheets, but you may end up using slightly more or less.  They may vary slightly in length, but that’s perfectly fine. Line them up side by side so that they form a rectangle. To envision what you are creating, think of the wall of a log cabin. It’s created of logs laying side by side. The tubes will be forming a three-dimensional rectangle, like the wall of a log cabin., Take long strips of tape and lay them across the tubes. Once the tubes are all held together pretty well, you can add reinforcement by wrapping long pieces of tape across the front and around to the back. Make sure that you are taping the top, bottom, front, and back of the tubes evenly. Do this repeatedly, and use a lot of tape, until the tubes form one study rectangle that you can pick up and gently shake without any coming loose.  You'll need to tear enough paper to cover the surface of your shield. It doesn’t matter what kind of paper you use or the size of strips you create in this step, because it won’t show anywhere when the shield is completed. This paper will simply be used to create a flat surface between the paper tubes and the decorated paper you will eventually be placing on top., Spread a thin layer of glue evenly over the paper tubes. Ordinary squeezable Elmer’s glue will do the trick. Glue the torn strips of paper all over the tubes. Only one side of the tubes needs to be covered, and don’t worry about covering the sides of the tubes. Make sure all of the tubes are covered by scrap paper. Let this dry completely., You can use either construction paper or thin poster board for this step. Obviously, the shield will be larger and more heavy-duty if you use poster board, but you will also need to create more paper tubes for the backing. This colored paper will be used to cover the paper tube structure you’ve created.Large sheets of paper work great, but you can also simply tape regular size sheets together.  To make sure that the design you create will fit onto the tube structure you’ve created, you may want to lay down the tube structure first and trace around it. Then, you can draw any shape you desire within the outline of the tubes. Once you’ve traced your shield onto the colored paper, cut it out.You can use a traditional shield shape, a circle, or find a unique shield design online. Shields can be pointed, rounded, simple, or intricate. Different shapes and styles can designate different time periods or geographic regions, so you can put some thought into the design you choose., Taking a pencil, lightly trace the outline of the shield onto the side of the tubes covered by the newspaper strips. The surface may be slightly bumpy from the tubes, so go slow and get the best outline you can. After you’ve traced the shield onto the tube structure, use the scissors to cut the shape.Complete this step slowly and carefully. Since you’ll be cutting through the taped together tubes, this can be kind of tricky. You can cut out the general shield shape, and then clean up any sloppy edges afterwards. Lay your colored shield outline onto the tube structure to make sure they are both the same shape.  It is easiest to do this before you glue it onto the tubes, because you can draw, paint, stamp, or write on a flat surface. Get creative! You can draw a picture, create a bold outline, write something, or anything else you desire.   One popular shield design is a family crest. You can find your family crest using a Google search, but be aware that you may find several different ones for your name., The paper shield and the tubes should be in the exact same shape, but you can trim the tubes if they do not line up perfectly. Remember to glue the shield onto the side of the tubes covered by newspaper. Put a flat, heavy object on top of the shield as it dries, so that it dries smoothly and firmly., If you've created a pretty large, heavier shield, you may want to use poster board for this step. If you used regular paper for your entire shield, than a few stacked sheets of regular paper should work fine for your handle. Use your judgment to choose which material will best support the weight of the shield you've already created.If you are using poster board, simply cut a rectangle about the length of a standard piece of paper. The width should be a width that you can comfortable wrap your hand around. If you choose to use sheets of paper, line them up evenly. Then, begin rolling the stack length-wise. The width of the final rolled strip should be about one inch, or whatever width you can grip comfortably.  Taking a pencil, make dashes on the surface on either side of your hand, so that you’ve marked the width of your hand. This step is necessary so that the handle is wide enough for you to grip. Remove your hand, and fold the strip where you’ve made the marks, creating a handle shape.To help you visualize this, imagine folding the paper into a geometric U-shape. The trough of the U is where you will be gripping the handle, and the tips of the U will be where the handle attaches to the shield.  To do this, you will need to create two more folds at the ends of the paper, flattening the ends so they can be taped down to the surface of the shield. You can place it directly in the middle of the shield, or wherever you prefer holding it. Use several strips of tape so that it is very sturdy. If your handle falls off during battle, your shield will be useless!	Gather your materials. Roll the plain white paper into tubes. Lay all of the tubes flat on a surface. Tape all of the paper tubes together. Tear spare newspaper into strips. Glue the paper strips onto the tubes. Choose what color you want your shield to be. Trace the outline of your shield onto the colored paper. Lay the cut out shield onto your paper tubes. Decorate the shield on the colored paper. Glue the decorated paper shield onto the cut tubes. Create your handle. Lay your hand across the paper or poster board. Tape the handle onto the back of your shield.
A plié refers to a stance in which you bend your knees outward while keeping your legs straight. Bend both legs so that you are almost at a deep lunge. Lift the back heel off the ground to prepare to initiate your movement into the turn.Stand with feet flat on the floor without bearing weight on either the inside or the outside of our foot. Make sure your weight is centered over the ball of your foot so as not to disrupt your alignment. Work on the angle between your feet as it will depend on the natural rotation of your hips. Once your feet are positioned, align your knees between your second and third toes and initiate the movement.; , Your arms will give you momentum to complete the turn. As you initiate your turn you want to close your arms into a circle as if you are holding a round beach ball. They should be straight out in front of your chest with your hands facing with palms inward and thumbs aligned., As you lift your back leg place your foot above the knee of your straight leg with your toe pointed toward the ground and turn. The one legged stance is known as relevé. Remember to keep your back straight and arms in a circle in front of you as you turn., Spotting is when you pick an item just above your eyeline that you focus on as you turn your head. This keeps your head straight and level as you turn. The quicker you spot, the quicker your turn will be. Hold your gaze as long as possible to help keep your balance., Once you’ve mastered the fundamentals for a single pirouette, move on to multiple pirouettes by keeping your momentum and focusing on your form. You cannot achieve multiple pirouettes without first learning the basics of a single one., Your core should be completely engaged to complete each pirouette. Focus on having proper balance and correct alignment. Picture being pulled up from the top of your head by an invisible string to a high relevé.   Strengthen your core with exercises like yoga, pilates, ballet, and jazz dance.  Spotting is exactly as it sounds as you turn your head and spot a point to turn your head in the direction you want to pirouette in. In order to achieve neat, quick turns your head must follow suit with a sharp, quick head turn. Spot a point slightly above your eye line, which will lift your chin as you turn.   If you look at the floor you will fall. Your pirouette will follow your line of sight as it helps you keep your balance.  Your hips should be aligned with your shoulders as you complete each pirouette. Your balance will be off as you turn if your alignment is off. Use a mirror as you stand in relevé to ensure that your shoulders and hips are aligned.   Check your side stance as well when you are at the mirror to ensure that you’re not leaning too far forward or back.  The base of each pirouette will be balanced on relevé so focus on keeping this balance without turning. You should be able to balance on relevé for several seconds otherwise you won’t be able to stay up during your pirouettes. Build your strength by balancing on each leg for 8 seconds or more. Try to balance as long as you can each time you practice.   Practice different turns to improve your balance such as turned-out retire, non-turned-out jazz pirouette, and turns in a la seconde. Changing up your turns will improve your balance. Compete with your friends to make practicing more fun. See who can hold their balance the longest.  Retire is a pose in ballet where your raise one leg to the side and bend the knee of that leg so that your toe points to make the sole of your foot parallel to the knee of your other leg. Your toe on your raised leg should be glued to the knee of your straight leg. If your toe drops below your knee as you pirouette, your turn will also drop. Your toe will pull your weight down so keep it level to your knee with your toe pointed. Not pointing your toe looks sloppy and ruins your form.  Give each pirouette energy by pushing off the floor from a deep plié position. Imagine that you are a spring so that you are ready to bounce up when pushed down. Give each pirouette momentum as you push yourself up from the ground. Control your force as you don’t want to push with too much energy that it throws off your coordination.   You want a deep plié for a powerful turn. Try breathing out as you plié to increase your power.  Make sure to wear proper footwear as it is difficult to execute multiple pirouettes barefoot because your feet will stick to the floor. You may also get a painful burn. There are special dance shoes designed specifically for pirouettes that you can purchase online or at your local dance store. These shoes enhance your natural arch will provide the traction needed to turn efficiently.  Keep the energy close to your body by crossing your palms over each other and keeping your arms close in a tight and neat circle. Make sure that your arms are connected to your back and shoulder blades by pretending that there is a rod that keeps your shoulder blades and upper back wide and open.   If your arms open from a tight and neat circle the energy and weight will be dispersed and through off your coordination.  Do not turn your supporting foot before you initiate the turn by allowing your other foot to take off.Your hip and shoulder will open too early and your arms will lag behind. Push off your back toes to initiate the turn and keep your leg turned in. Keep your core in one piece as you use your arms as a steering while to guide your core around the turn.You know your coordination is off if you feel out of control or like you are in the spin cycle of your washing machine.  Spot before you turn and do not change it. Changing your spot as you turn will throw you off. If you spot too slowly or too fast your rotation will suffer. Think of the music when you need to spot; then, spot, hold, and follow through., Poor alignment can come from sitting on your supporting side, lifting your working hip, or throwing your upper body back. Think about squaring your hips and shoulders, keeping your core engaged, and keeping your legs strong under you. Push down on your supporting leg as you lift the other to follow through in your turn under balance., Practice fundamentals and technique. Don’t develop bad habits. Focus on every movement and the correct function of each part of your body. Use a mirror to help with form. Practice with friends to help support each other.   Avoid changing your focal mid spot or spotting too slowly. This will throw off your coordination and balance. Make sure you keep your core engaged and keep your body in a straight line. It’s easy to fall into the bad habit of tilting or slouching if you don’t focus on keeping your body pulled up.	Start with a plié. Open your arms. Lift your back leg and initiate your turn. Focus on spotting. Move on to multiple pirouettes. Pull up and keep your core engaged. Spot quickly. Keep proper alignment. Keep your balance on relevé. Position your toe correctly when you retire. Use the floor. Wear appropriate footwear. Pull in your arms for tighter turns. Focus on coordination. Determine where you’re spotting. Keep your balance. Practice as much as your schedule allows.
Cedar is a good choice, since it is free of preservatives and naturally resists rot and decay. Plus, it is easier to work with than hardwoods or tightly grained softwoods such as pine that are more likely to warp and split.; , The one in this illustration is 18 inches (46cm) wide, 22 inches (56cm) long, but the final size depends upon your needs.  These pieces will be the main supports, serving as both the mounting frame for the wheel and for the handles, so choosing good lumber is important.  Scribe a pair of parallel lines on the thicker end so you will have a pocket for the wheel/axle assembly to mount in.  Then scribe a block to fasten the two handles together, staying back about 12 inches (30cm) from the end you are using for the wheel mount.  Three layers will give you a wheel about 2 inches (5cm) thick, using two 1 X 6 inch (2.5cm x 15cm) planks will allow you to cut a wheel 11 inches (28cm) in diameter, as shown in the illustrations.  Then cut it out with a jigsaw or band saw.  A 1/2 inch (1.5cm) galvanized rod will give you a fairly stout axle. Put a nut on the all-thread, running it down about 3 inches (7.5cm), then add a flat washer. Thread your rod through one handle, and start a nut on the end where it passes through the handle. Tighten it so that it pulls into the wood if possible, to make it stationary.  Add another washer, then another nut, before allowing it to pass through the second handle. Add a final nut on the outside of the second handle, and tighten it securely. Make sure the space between the wheel and its washer spacers is fairly tight, but not too tight, so the wheel cannot wobble.  You can begin by laying this assembly on the inverted box and marking the edges of the handles so you can fit the next piece in the correct location.  Lay them on the lines you marked earlier and fasten them with wood screws.  Add your legs and braces, using 2 X 2 inch (5cm x 5cm) material scribed on the angle of the handles so that they support the wheelbarrow in the position you want. You can let these legs run wild (cut longer than needed) so you can trim them when you have completed the project.  You can now set the wheelbarrow right side up and check it to make sure it sits correctly. There are a number of simple ways of adjusting the way the wheelbarrow sets, including adding wedges underneath the box, and trimming the support legs.  You can line the wheelbarrow box with plastic to give it more protection from moisture if you are going to use it for a planter, but if you use a good, exterior grade wood, it should last for a long time with just a sealer on it.	Select the wood you want to use for your wheelbarrow. Build a simple, basic box suitable for your needs. Rip two pieces of sound 2 inch (5cm) thick lumber on a taper from about 1 1/4 inches to 2 inches (3cm to 5cm) and around 4 feet (1.2 meters) long. Lay these handles on a table, placing them at an angle that will allow the grip ends to be spread apart far enough for you to use them, and with the wide end almost touching. Cut these two lines with a circular saw. Build your wheel by gluing and screwing layers of 1 inch (2.5cm) thick boards together at opposite angles. Scribe a circle on the blank you built for building the wheel. Drill the handle frame and the center of the wheel to accommodate an all-thread rod. Place a washer on the rod, then pass it through the wheel. Install the handle/wheel assembly on the bottom of the box you built earlier. Cut two wedges from 2 x 4 inch (5cm x 10cm) material, the same length as the box. Lay your wheel and handle assembly on these wedges, and screw them in place. Cut and install a cross brace between the wheelbarrow support legs to keep it from wobbling. Sand edges smooth if desired, and seal or paint the wheelbarrow with an exterior coating.
The two grips that come in a package have slightly different-sized holes. The one that is slightly larger is meant to be installed on the side of the throttle, which is usually the right side. The smaller one should be installed on the side without the throttle.  Apply a grip glue, such as E-6000, inside the hand grip opening and along the handlebar. The edge of one side of the grip is raised, while the other edge is not. Slide the grip onto the handlebar, raised edge first, before the glue begins to dry. Keep pushing until the raised edge of the grip is flush against the inside of the handlebar. When it's secure in place, squeeze the grip to help the glue set.          Don't use too much adhesive; apply just enough to hold the grip in place. If you use too much adhesive it will squeeze out the ends of the grip and make a mess. Make sure to work quickly enough that the glue doesn't dry before you replace the grip. If it becomes hard to work with, use rubbing alcohol to remove the grip glue and start over. If you don't have grip glue, try the hairspray method, advocated by many seasoned motorcyclists.  Apply the glue to the grip meant for the throttle side as well as the handlebar. Quickly slide the grip onto the handlebar, raised edge first, until it is flush against the inside of the handlebar. Squeeze the grip to help the glue set.  Screw the ends of the handlebars back on so that the grips are held firmly in place.  Wait several hours for the glue to dry before using the motorcycle. When it's dry, test the grips to make sure you like them. If you find them to be uncomfortable, replace them using the same method.	Sort out which grip goes on which side. Install the non-throttle grip. Install the throttle grip. Replace the bar ends. Let the glue dry.
A multimeter is a small hand held device that can be used to measure voltage, resistance, and amperage. Each model will only be rated to handle a certain amount of current, and this rating needs to be adequate for the electrical system you want to test. For example, running 200 amps through a multimeter rated for 10 amps will ruin the multimeter's fuse. The amperage rating will be printed on the unit or in the owner's manual.; , Most multimeters have functions for measuring several different quantities. To measure amperage, you need to set the function to either measure AC amperage or DC amperage, depending on the electrical system you are testing. The power source for your system will determine the type of current. For example, household power is AC, while power from a battery is DC.  To ensure that you don't blow your device's fuse, set the maximum amperage sensitivity to well above your expected reading. You can adjust this downward if the multimeter does not read anything when hooked into your system.  Your multimeter should come with 2 cords, each with a probe on 1 end and a lead on the other. Plug both cords into the correct terminals for measuring amperage; the owner's manual will specify the correct terminals if they are not labeled clearly.  This is extremely dangerous and can cause electrical shock if measuring household AC or other high voltage or high amperage sources or even lower sources. Turn off all breakers before working with this and use an AC current sense probe to see if AC is absolutely off before touching any wires especially bare ones. Do not work in a wet environment on even a high humidity one. This can conduct electricity and hurt you. Wear heavy rubber gloves. Additional precautions may be necessary. Consult a real electrical workbook (not an online source) before attempting this. Assume wires can have missing insulation from accidental damage during installation or old age. Missing insulation can cause electrical shock. Always have someone ready with a cell phone who is not touching you who can call an Emergency number in case of worst case scenario. This person should also be trained in first aid and CPR. If electrical shock occurs, this person may have to remove you using some type of insulated material (a dry article of clothing for example but something else may need to be used) or else that person will also undergo shock due to the conductivity of skin and maybe some clothing (and other materials). Always consult a real electrical safety book before attempting this and know what type of signal you are dealing with. Consult a real electrical manual before attempting this about the dangers involved and how to prevent them (not an online source). Clip the wire in a single spot and strip back the insulation on both exposed ends. Secure these ends separately to the leads of the amp meter. Only do the measurement after the wires are securely attached to the amperage meter probes. Make sure these wires especially the exposed ends cannot touch you. Turn back on the breaker and adjust the meter sensitivity if no reading is produced.  Follow the precautions outlined in step 5 and consult a real electrical book (not an online source) for safety precautions. After taking your reading, you will need to complete the broken circuit again. It is much safer to do this by buying and installing new wire rather than trying to patch the area where you cut it.	Determine the amperage rating for your digital multimeter. Select the appropriate function on your multimeter. Set the range on your multimeter. Plug the leads into the appropriate terminals. Run the circuit through the multimeter to measure the current. Turn off the breaker and use an AC current sense probe to make sure AC is off and then and only then rewire the circuit.
Your idol may be a relatively unknown but up-and-coming author who’s set to sign books at Barnes & Nobles next month in your city. Here’s your change to meet her! Book signings are also a great way to meet both world figures and celebrities. Increasingly, celebrities are writing memoirs and actresses and actors are appearing at signings that coincide with the openings of the movies they starred in from that particular book series.In almost all cases, you are required to buy the book from the bookstore hosting the signing, so make sure you bring along enough money to buy one. Consider buying more than one book, so you have extra time with your idol. To find out if your idol is having a book signing for a recently published book, look for a social media announcement from your idol; go to the publisher's website and its social media sites; look on major retailers' websites like Barnes & Noble; and talk with local bookstores, particularly if you live in a major metropolitan area., In case you’ve always wondered but never thought to ask, VIP means “very important person.” You can be one, too, for the right price. Usually, that price is high. Yet purchasing VIP tickets to concerts, plays, comedy shows, the ballet and sporting events come with a variety of perks. One of those perks is often a “meet and greet pass.” Depending upon the event, this could mean you meet your idol or that you meet someone or several people that are part of, for example, a ballet troupe or a baseball team. This could include your idol.You also often get a photograph as a part of VIP packages, and, in some cases, much more, such as invites to pre- or post-event parties. Make sure that you read the details carefully. You can get VIP tickets in a number of ways – from ticketing services like VIPNation.com, Ticketmaster.com, VIPTickets.com, Premiumseatsusa.com and from the venues and organizations themselves. Not all events will have VIP tickets, and you’ll want to buy them either through pre-sales offers or within minutes of tickets going on sale for many events.  Often, joining an official fan club is free, and with some you can get one of the most coveted perks of belonging to a fan club – being included in a lottery or drawing to win a meet and greet pass after you buy a ticket to a show or event. Frequently, however, this opportunity is only available when you upgrade your membership, or pay for a higher level. Plenty of fan clubs, however, are not free for even basic membership. Many of these, such as certain major league sports team fan clubs, will go beyond basic meet and greets and include invitations to dinners and other events.Some of the other benefits of upgrading and paying for fan clubs include access to dress rehearsals and practices where you might get more than a handshake and a photo, online chats and conference calls and dibs on pre-sales tickets (which can help get VIP tickets)., While major movie awards programs like the Golden Globes and the Oscars are virtually impossible to get tickets to, even for those in the industry, others such as the BET Music Awards are possible. These, along with movie premieres and film festivals, give you an opportunity to potentially meet countless celebrities.If your idol is less well known, see if he or she has a website that lists upcoming speaking events or performances nearby or in your area. Some may even be free. Here’s a good site for finding tickets for movie premieres, film festivals and awards shows: thevipconcierge.com.  This might be leaning to the stalker side, but if you know that your idol works out a particular gym, for instance, you might consider joining the same gym. If you know that your idol always attends Lakers games and sits in a specific spot, you might try to get seats nearby. If, for example, your idol is your town’s former mayor, and she eats at the same diner every Wednesday for lunch, you might eat there as well. Strike up a conversation and offer to pay for her lunch!	Go to book signings. Buy VIP tickets. Pay for fan clubs or upgraded fan-club levels. Attend movie premieres, awards programs, film festivals and other ticketed events. Do what your idol does.
You can find junkyards in area by:   Looking in your phone book. Check the yellow pages under “Auto Parts” or “Junkyards”. Doing an online search. Check local business listings online using directories such as Yellow Pages, Yahoo Local or run a search for used auto parts or junkyards using your favorite search engine. , To do this, take the vehicle and title to the junkyard, sign the title over to whomever the junkyard requests, and take your cash.   Be sure to have a friend follow, so you have a way home! If the car does not run, you will need the junkyard or an independent tow truck service, whom you pay, to two the car to the yard for you. Call and ask if the junkyard provides tow service, and if not, shop around for the best deal on a private tow.	If you are not eligible for a tax deduction, make a list of local junkyards. Call each junkyard on your list and ask how much they will pay you for your car.  , Donate your car to the junkyard that offers to pay the most.
It’s possible to get quite creative when using natural materials for creating lawn edging. Stone or wood make good choices. For the most natural effect you don’t want these to be too uniform, so choose rough-looking wood such as reclaimed railway sleepers or uneven shapes of natural stone.; , Stone tends to be an expensive choice of edging material and it is laborious to put in place.   It’s also harder to avoid damaging the lawnmower or knocking the stones out of place when mowing. This usually means you’ll get a less neat finish after mowing.       A trimmer may help, or consider hand-trimming the edges to tidy them up.  If you are using wood to edge your garden, make sure it’s been pressure treated or that a preservative has been applied to it. This will ensure a longer life.   If you are using reclaimed wood such as railway sleepers, check they are plant safe. Some wood can be contaminated with chemicals that will negatively affect plants.       If you plan to use the sleepers for sitting on or for eating off, make sure they aren’t sticky with creosote. Creosote will ruin your clothes and emit unpleasant smells.  Plants can also be used to create a natural visual edge to define your borders. You’ll need to select something low-growing and fairly compact. Dwarf Perennial Lavender makes a good choice, as does Thyme, Speedwell or Geranium.   It will be necessary to keep these plants well-trimmed or you may not get a uniform look. You will also have the issue of how to mow the lawn right to the edges without damaging the edging plants. You might like to use plant edging in combination with another type of edging such as trench edging. Plant the edging plants so they conceal whatever edging material you are using.	Choose wood and stone materials that look as natural as possible. Be aware that stone can be expensive and difficult to install. Choose wooden materials that have been treated and preserved. Choose low-growing, compact plants as edging materials.
Bending guitar strings are how you put personality into your notes, taking basic scales like the blues pentatonic and molding it to fit your unique musical ideas. Bends, appropriately, are a way to add "tone color" to your playing. They are accent notes, used for emphasis and improvisation.          All of the techniques and rules here should be, to pardon the pun, bent. Experiment with bends and strings to get the tones you want for your playing.; , You can, of course, bend with any finger you want. However, using your ring finger will allow you to put the middle and index fingers behind the fret as well, giving you three fingers to help bend the strings instead of one.          The thicker your strings, the harder they are to bend. As such, acoustic guitars are often harder to bend, and you'll need 2-3 fingers to really manipulate the string.  Keeping your fingers firmly in place, use your whole hand to bend the notes. The power comes from your forearm, which you should feel moving as you bend. Think of it as turning your wrist to push your index finger, and thus the string, as high as you can.  Bends are almost always simply notated, whether you're reading tab or a guitar score. A bend, remember, makes your note higher pitched. As such, all written music tells you wen to bend, and how high to bend the note -- telling you which fret the note should sound like when bent the right amount. The following two methods of writing bends are the most common:           Tab: Usually written with a "b" for bend an a "r" for release, when the bend ends:  G|---------4b5r4------| would mean "bend the 4th fret up so it sounds like the 5th fret, then release back to the 4th."    Guitar scores: Will have a small upward arrow drawn on the staff, like the one in the video. It will tell you how far to bend the note, as well as when to come back down.  Half-bends only go up one fret. Full-bends go up two frets. Over bends push the note three frets or higher.	Use bends for a unique, bluesy way to transition between notes. Hold down the note you want to bend with your ring finger. Pivot your wrist up and away from your body to bend. Learn how to read bends in written guitar music.
This will bring up the options that you can use with it.   For example, this particular Fontwork Gallery, uses the Fontwork toolbar and the 3D Settings toolbar.; , It is in the Drawing Object Properties toolbar. This will bring up all of the various options that you have for your chosen artwork.  Things that you will want to take into consideration are:       The color of your paper that you will be using The readability of it. 3D effects are all well and good, but really pay attention and see if it is legible. ,	Once you have changed the words of your Fontwork artwork, then single click on it. Click on the paint bucket. Experiment with various looks until you get what you want. Take your time and if you find a look you like, consider saving it and continuing on in your search.      ,Depending on what you are using it for, remember that simpler is usually better.
Fold the excess fabric down, angling the fold either outward or inward. Pin the fold into place. For a scalloped neckline, pin the fold inwards. For a v-neck, pin outwards.  Hand sew the fold so the sewing is less prominent.  Pin them to the fabric and then sew them.  Fold the open edges inward just a little.  Hold the fold to make sure that it stays even. Tuck the fabric of the bodice inside the tube and pin it down '  ,, Tie the tube ties around your neck and zip up the zipper.	Put the dress on and place your hand on the excess fabric above the bust. Take the dress off and sew the fold into place. Fold down the raw edges of the shirt around the arm opening. Take the straps that you sewed earlier. Pin the straps to the shirt onto the top corners of the bodice. Sew the tubes onto the fabric.  , Wear the dress.
Many factory car alarms are designed to turn off when in proximity to the appropriate key or key fob. You may be able to shut your car alarm down simply by inserting your key into the lock on the driver’s side door, locking it, and unlocking it again. Because the car is being unlocked by the appropriate key, it may send a signal to the alarm that it can shut down.While the passenger side door may work, it is more likely it will work on the driver’s side. If the door is already locked, simply unlock it. If the alarm doesn’t stop, try locking it an unlocking it again.; , Using a similar methodology to the key method, unlocking the vehicle’s doors with the key fob will also shut down many factory car alarms. When standing close enough to the vehicle for your key fob to reach, press the lock button followed by the unlock button. Many car alarms will shut down when the car doors are unlocked by the keys or appropriate key fob. If the door locks do not respond, the batteries may be dead in the key fob. Replace the batteries and try again. If the doors unlock and the alarm continues to go off, your vehicle may need to be repaired by a professional.  Most key fobs have an orange or yellow button on them commonly referred to as a “panic button.” This button activates something very similar to a car alarm. The horn will honk and the lights will flash. If you accidentally hit the panic button, it may continue until you press the button again. In some cars, you may be able to shut down the panic mode by starting the car and driving it.Most panic alarms will shut off on their own after a certain amount of time. The panic alarm may not shut off when you start the car, but will if you begin to drive.  Your alarm is designed to prevent your vehicle from being stolen by someone without a key, so starting the car with the ignition key is often sufficient to power down your car alarm. Unlock the door and enter your vehicle. Insert the key and turn it to “ACC” (accessories). If the alarm persists, attempt to start the car. Remember that some aftermarket alarms may not allow you to start the car with the alarm sounding, even with the key.Turning the key in the ignition should reset the alarm, but that may not always be the case.  Standing next to a car with a blaring alarm may not strike you as the best time to do some light reading, but your vehicle’s owner’s manual can likely provide you with important information about shutting off your car alarm. If you are unable to shut the alarm off with your keys or key fob, check the owner’s manual for instructions on what to do.Every auto maker uses different car alarms, so some may require a specific action be taken before the alarm will shut down. You may need to repeat an action a certain number of times to reset the computer, such as locking and unlocking the door.	Use the key to lock and unlock the driver’s side door. Use the key fob to lock and unlock the door. Make sure you haven’t hit the panic button. Start the car. Read the owner’s manual.
There are arguments for both approaches -- two pipes are better than one in terms of flow capacity, but adding a second pipe may be a more-difficult plumbing job.  If using the existing pipe, you will need to cut it and install a check valve and T-connector. The check valve goes below the T-connector between the T and the existing sump pump. Make sure the flow direction for the check valve is correct! A second check valve will be installed between the side of the T-connector and the new bilge pump. If installing a new bilge pump outflow pipe, run that to the same place that your current sump outflow exits. For such a long run, you should use electrical ties to keep the pipe from sagging when full of water.; , The bilge pump secondary level control switch needs to be installed a few inches above the existing sump level control switch. There are many possibilities for mounting this switch. The main consideration is that the switch must be mounted so that nothing interferes with its operation and that it is solidly mounted., This will entail finishing the plumbing by either attaching the bilge pump to the anti-backflow valve or to the independent outflow pipe. (No backflow valve is required for the independent pipe approach.) , Make all connections above the water level. Use wire nuts and anti-oxidation compound for long-term reliability. Polarity is important for DC circuits! , If the sump pump runs but does not pump, you may have the polarity reversed., You should see at least a trickle-charge if not a several-amp charging current. Test the pump again with the charger and battery., Also, the bilge pump should work properly with no house power available.,	Determine whether you are going to use the existing outflow pipe for both pumps or add a second pipe for just the bilge pump. Know where it needs to be installed. Install the bilge pump in the sump. Connect the battery, fuse, control switch (optional), bilge level control switch, and bilge pump with heavy-duty wiring. Test the battery-only operation. Attach the charger to the battery and plug in the charger. Final testing should include making sure the original sump pump and the new bilge pump sequence properly and work simultaneously.Make sure all connections are taped and all wires are tied or taped and you should be done.Make sure the charger is set to automatic mode (it will maintain the battery normally but switch to charge mode if there is a draw on the battery or it is discharged after an outage).
Turn on all faucets to see which ones are working. If water is running through one faucet but not another, the problem is located along the pipes running between the two. Leave all faucets open slightly. A small trickle of running water from working faucets can prevent further freezing and help melt the ice. Leave blocked faucets open as well to reduce pressure on the pipes.   Most American houses have faucets on external walls too, especially on the front and back of the house.; , If a large area of your house has no water, look in the most likely and accessible areas first before you start tearing apart walls. Use the steps below to focus on these areas, unless you managed to narrow down the search to a smaller portion of your house:   Pipes in or near uninsulated crawlspaces, attics, or basements. Pipes near cold air vents or cold concrete. Outdoor valves and spigots. Outdoor pipes can freeze, but check these last, as most systems are designed to keep standing water out of these pipes.  Examine the pipes in the affected area carefully. Freezing water can cause pipes to crack from the change in pressure, usually splitting the pipe lengthwise or causing cracks in the joints.   To look at the backs of pipes near walls, and in other difficult to reach areas, use a flashlight and a large dental mirror from a hardware store. If you find a leak, close the main shut-off valve immediately. Call a plumber to replace the pipe, or fix it yourself if you are up to the task.  Assuming there are no leaks or cracks, find the section of the pipe with frozen water using one of the following methods.   Feel the temperature of the pipe with your hand, or use an infrared thermometer to locate areas significantly colder than other pipes. Tap the pipe with a screwdriver handle or other object, listening for a more solid, less "hollow" sound. If you rule out all exposed pipes in the affected area, skip to the section on unfreezing pipes inside walls.  Open the faucet attached to the frozen pipe, and open nearby working faucets to a trickle. Running water is much less likely to freeze than standing water. If the running water passes through or near a frozen area, it may even help thaw the ice over the course of an hour or two.   If you see any cracks in any pipe, turn off the main water supply to your house immediately, and close all faucets.  Turn on a hair dryer and run it back and forth along the frozen pipe. Keep it moving and do not place the dryer directly against the pipe, as uneven or sudden heating can rupture the pipe. If your pipes are metal, you can use a more powerful heat gun in the same fashion.   PVC pipes can be damaged at temperatures as low as 140ºF (60ºC). Never use a heat gun or other direct heat stronger than a hair dryer. Outdoor valves often have fiber washers or other non-heat-safe materials inside them. Heat them slowly and cautiously.  Purchase electrical heat tape from a hardware store. Wrap the tape in a single layer around the length of the frozen pipe, then plug it into a power source. The tape consists of heating elements that warm up when turned on.   Do not overlap electrical heat tape. Wrap it around the pipe only once or in a spiral pattern.  Position space heaters, bare incandescent light bulbs, or heat lamps in the room with the frozen pipe, near the pipe but not touching it. Hang up tarps or blankets to trap the heat in a smaller area, but don't let them come into direct contact with the heat source. For large rooms, use several heat sources to ensure safe, even heating of the pipe.  Salt lowers the melting point of ice, causing it to melt at colder temperatures. Pour a tablespoon (15 mL) of salt down the drain, and give it time to act on the ice.   You can try dissolving the salt in 1/2 cup (120 mL) boiling water first, but this risks bursting the pipe with a sudden temperature change., Put on rubber gloves, and soak towels in hot water. Ring them out, then wrap them securely around the frozen section of pipe. Replace with freshly soaked, hot towels every 5–10 minutes until the pipe thaws.   Do not leave cold wet towels around the pipes.  If you can find an external vent, put down a fan heater blowing warm air into the vent. Use a cardboard box or tarp to minimize the amount of heat lost to the surrounding air.  Crank the heat in the house to around 75 to 80ºF (24–27ºC) and wait two to three hours.   Open closet and cabinet doors so the warm air circulates as close to the walls as possible.  Unfortunately, this is often necessary to reach a frozen pipe before it bursts. Follow the instructions in the locating pipes section to isolate the most likely area of the problem. Use a keyhole saw to cut a hole into this area, then use any of the methods in the section on unfreezing pipes.   If this is a recurring problem, consider installing a cabinet door over the hole instead of fully repairing the wall, for ease of access next time this occurs.  Keep pipes in cold areas wrapped with "pipe sponge" covers, rags, or other insulating material. If an electrical outlet is nearby, you can keep them wrapped with electrical heat tape, unplugged, then plug the tape in whenever cold weather arrives.  Check your crawlspaces and external walls for holes, and repair them to minimize exposure to cold air. Use wind barriers or faucet covers to protect faucets and valves on the exterior of the house.  During cold weather, turn on a 60 watt incandescent light bulb near the area of pipe that previously froze, or just below it. If used to warm crawl spaces and other unsupervised areas, make sure there are no flammable materials kept in the same space.  It is much more difficult for pipes to freeze if water is running through them, since the water will usually travel through the pipe before it has time to freeze. During sub-freezing weather, keep faucets slightly open to allow a trickle of water.   You can adjust the ballast in your toilet tank to keep it running even when the tank is full.	Narrow down the search. Look in the most likely areas. Search for cracks and leaks. Find the frozen area. Leave faucets slightly open. Use a hair dryer or heat gun. Apply heat tape. Heat the surrounding air. Add salt to frozen drains. Wrap the pipe in hot towels. Blow a fan heater into outdoor vents. Turn up the central heating. Cut a hole in the wall. Insulate the pipes. Protect the pipes from wind and cold air. Heat the area. Leave a trickle of water running.
Make a medallion necklace similar to what might be worn at a Native American powwow by using seed beads and felt. Bead designs into a circular piece of felt, and attach that to a leather or faux leather cord.   You can create any design you want on the medallion with different colored seed beads. To sew on beads securely, use nylon beading thread to pick up four beads, stitch through your foundation material, then loop back through the last two beads before picking up four new ones.Use a sharp needle that can go through the felt for your medallion but still thin enough to fit through your beads. You can use larger beads, or a thinner foundation material and attach it to felt later, if you’re having trouble with this.  Put a stone on display by stringing it on a cord to wear as a necklace. Use turquoise, coral, or other precious or semiprecious stones commonly found in Native American jewelry.   Try using a natural material for the cord such as leather or suede, or an imitation version of these. Look for a stone in a jewelry store that has a pre-drilled hole or a jump ring to run a cord through. If you can’t find this, you can try wrapping a stone in thin, flexible wire in order to attach it to a cord for your necklace., Attach one or more feathers to the bottom of any pendant or medallion for a natural touch. You can also feature feathers exclusively in your necklace by wrapping the feather quills with cord.   Use natural feathers rather than ones that have been artificially dyed. You can also thread beads onto the quill of a feather for decoration and to help attach it to the cord or chain of a necklace. Push a bead onto the quill, then thread a headpin (flexible pin with a flat end) through the bead in the opposite direction. Then bend the headpin around a jump ring or your cord to attach it.	Create a beaded medallion. Make a simple stone pendant. Utilize feathers in a necklace.
You want the soil to be loose and light when sowing your sunflower seeds. If your soil is low in nutrients or drains poorly, mix in three to four inches of compost.  You can simply use your hands to dig these small holes. If planting in rows, make sure to allow about 30 inches (76.2 cm) of soil between each row. Sunflowers need a lot of space to grow healthily.   For large sunflower types, allow 18 inches (45.7 cm) of space between seeds. For medium-sized sunflower types, allow 12 inches (30.5 cm) of space between seeds.  You can stagger your planting over a few weeks in order to experience blooms at different times throughout the summer. Since sunflowers are annuals, meaning they flower once per year, staggering your seeds will allow you to enjoy blooms over a longer period of time.  Choose an organic fertilizer when possible and spread it over the seeding area to promote strong stalks.  Make sure you wet the soil, but do not drench or flood the seeds.	Loosen the soil using your hands or a hand trowel. Dig one-inch deep holes, spaced six to 18 inches (45.7 cm) apart, depending on the varietal size. Place a few seeds in each hole and cover with soil. Mix a thin layer of fertilizer after planting the seeds. Water thoroughly after planting and fertilizing.
There are a few major things to do before handing over the keys of your car to a vehicle transport company. Thus, it is good to create a checklist first and then move down every step, especially when you are moving your car across the country.; , Since you will be moving your car across the country you will need a shipping company that can deliver nationwide. It is a good idea to choose a company that is both a carrier and a broker. As a carrier the company has trucks traveling certain roads all the time which often means a quicker delivery of your vehicle across the country. If they don't serve the route you need, then they will find a carrier from their network to pick up your vehicle.  Research and contact a few companies. Ask them questions regarding their services and rates. Obtain quotes from all of them. Compare the services they offer and the prices they are asking you to pay. If there is a big difference in some rates, consider this a red flag. Car shipping rates are affected by many variables and they can fluctuate often, yet they should be close when it is for the same vehicle and route. Rates vary based on gas prices, miles, make and model of the vehicle, modifications to the vehicle and seasonal changes.  Make sure you are safe when you are transporting your car across the country. Verify the company's licenses, ratings and insurance policy. Check their USDOT number and BBB rating. It is a good practice to also read reviews of what other customers are saying about the company policies and practices. This is the best way to make sure the company you have chosen is going to deliver what they have promised, and most importantly your car in the same condition it was picked up.  It is important to have your car's interior and exterior cleaned before pick up to make the inspection easier. The truckers always inspect a car before loading it onto the trailer and mark down any scratches and damages your car has. You should also go over the inspection with the trucker. This way you will be sure that everything is marked correctly when you sign the Bill of Lading and the inspection report. Preparing your car for shipping across the country also means removing any loose parts such as ski and bike racks, rear spoilers, spare tire and all other covers and modifications you can remove.	Create a checklist. Search for car transport companies. Contact a few car shipping companies. Choose a company and verify its legitimacy. Prepare your car for shipping.
Some pruning is done for the health of the tree, but most pruning is done for the sake of appearance. You can remove dead, dying, or diseased wood from the tree regardless of its age. The removal of awkward or unappealing branches should be held back until the Japanese maple has a chance to grow into its natural shape, which usually does not happen until it reaches two to three years of age.; , Technically, the only time of year when you cannot prune a Japanese maple is spring, since sap is developing during this time. Late summer and winter are the most favorable times, though.During winter, you can clearly see the branches and will be able to tell which ones interfere with the overall structure of the tree. In summer, you can get a better idea for how the tree will look with certain branches removed. Pruning in the summer also stimulates less new growth, which can help prevent the tree from growing out of control.  There are two main types of Japanese maple tree: upright and lace leaf.Upright Japanese maple trees have branches that point upward, as most trees do. The branches should resemble opened fans. Weeping or laceleaf Japanese maple trees have branches that grow upward, to the sides, and downward. The top layer of the tree should create a veil or canopy over the rest of the tree.  The first, most important thing to prune away are the diseased, dying, or dead stems growing on the tree. Deadwood appears most often on the inside bottom of the tree, where excess shade has caused the wood to rot. Dying or diseased wood can rot further, spreading disease to the rest of your otherwise healthy tree.  Branches that overlap one another usually wreck the silhouette of the tree. Even if they do not, the two branches could eventually end up interfering with one another’s growth. Remove one or both of the overlapping branches, sawing them off at the base, nearest the trunk, rather than merely cutting them away where they start to overlap.  Branches that hand down into the area occupied by another branch or branches that are too close to each other can make the tree’s foliage look clumpy. The goal is to make the Japanese maple tree look evenly thinned out. You can either prune or saw off the weaker of the two branches, or you can determine which branch is less important to the tree’s outline and remove that one.  For an upright tree, a top branch that grows downward would be a good example. For a weeping or laceleaf Japanese maple, a common example would be a lower branch extending straight and upward. Saw the offending limb off at its base.   Note that many lace leaf version have twisted, curved branches that should not look straight. As long as these branches are not interfering with other branches, they should be kept.  These trees have "opposite buds" or "opposite branches," meaning that the smallest branches grow out of the larger branches two at a time. The resulting branch looks like a "Y" with an extra branch coming out from the center. Remove this center branch so that the branches look like a normal "Y." Cut as close to the point of intersection as possible, leaving as little of the center stem as possible., For upright varieties, the lower lateral branches can make it difficult to walk under the tree or may conflict with plants growing beneath it. For laceleaf varieties, you should expect branches to hang low. Branches that drag on the ground hang too low, though, and can be removed for the sake of appearance.  When you see buds developing, you can manage them to direct the eventual growth of the tree. Buds point in the direction that the tree will grow in, and many buds grow into dominant branches. If a bud is placed in a location that you believe will be inconvenient, you can pluck it out by hand to redirect the tree's growth in a different direction.  Light pruning is the best way to manage this because it limits regrowth, preventing excessive growth from forming on one side but not on another.   Another important part of keeping a balanced form is by avoiding dramatic diameter differences. If you prune a thick branch back to a small side branch, the shape of that section will look unbalanced and out of proportion.  Never remove a limb with a diameter that is more than half the size of the tree’s trunk. For older trees, you should consider keeping any limb with a diameter that is more than 1/4 to 1/3 the size of the tree trunk’s diameter., Removing too much of the tree's growth can stimulate excessive growth or cause unnecessary stress to the Japanese maple. You should also avoid removing more than 1/4 of the foliage on any given branch. Otherwise, the branch may not be able to absorb enough nutrients.	Use pruning to shape mature trees. Prune in the summer or winter. Know how the branches of your Japanese maple should look. Remove dead wood. Cut away branches that cross or intertwine. Saw off weak branches that could interfere with strong branches. Remove branches growing in the wrong direction. Use a selective heading cut. Remove lower branches, if desired. Snip away buds to direct branch growth. Keep things balanced. Leave the largest limbs intact. Never remove more than 1/5 of the tree’s crown.
Look for pine cones that can sit up on their own without props. Avoid using any that seem too heavy or too skinny.   Test each pine cone by seeing if it can stand on its own and looks symmetrical.;	Gather pine cones from your yard or the park.
Does your dresser need to be stripped and re-painted or stained? Or can you simply change out drawer pulls and add numbers?; , If the piece is falling over and has weak legs, you may want to think about retiring it forever. However, if the basic bones are in good shape it may be a piece you can salvage.   Have an expert evaluate the piece if you are working with an antique or a family heirloom. Something this valuable may not be a good idea for a novice furniture restoration artist so call in the pros instead.	Consider what type of update the dresser requires. Determine if furniture is in workable order.
; , Do this by counting the beats in the bar. Most songs are written in 4/4(you can count to four in a musical bar), or 3/4 (three beats).  It is not very important to have the exact chord(E9 instead of E11 for instance), as long as you know the tonic (or main chord tone). This tends to be the lowest note in the chord, and the chord is named after that tone. For example, the tonic of an E Major Chord is E. ,, If you don't play drums yourself or don't have recording options nearby, use a drum machine (you may find free software on the internet which imitates a drum machine). Either you can use pre-programmed beats, which often works very well, or program it yourself. Most songs favor drum patterns which have the bass drum hitting on beats one and three, snare drum on beats two and four, and hi-hat or ride cymbal on all four beats, often doubling the hits for more rock-influenced music.  Do this by using either a bass guitar or a keyboard on the darker half of the keys. If you want it simple, the best approach would be to let the bass play the tonic of the chord, if you like to spice things up, you can use notes from whatever chord being played at that beat. The rhythm of the bass is crucial, beyond telling people what chords they are listening to, the bass usually plays together with the drums to establish the groove. A simple way is to let bass play at the same beats as the bass drum. Another is just playing 8th notes(two notes per beat) for å more driving groove.  Find out how the rhythm section of the song should affect the grove and feel. By using dynamics and spicy notes, one can create songs that have depth of dimension just by adding very basic elements.	Get a pencil and a sheet of paper. Find the song's time signature. Find out which chords that is used.Write down all the beats in each section, and mark each bar (that would be four beats in 4/4)  , Write down the chords on the beat they are being played.  , Add Drums. Add Bass. Arrange.

Good choices include pelargonium (scented geranium), lavender, pansies, mint, thyme, lemon balm, mint, rosemary, bay leaves, violets, etc. When picking them, ensure that you keep a little stem on each one to help keep its place in the tussie mussie.; , Arrange the various herbs in a circular way around the flower. Try to maintain each herb at an even level with each other herb. Let the stems stick out downwards to form one stem or holding point.   If wished, arrange the leaves and flowers on a foil doily to help create the circular shape and keep everything in place. If doing this, make a small hole in the middle of the doily to allow the stems to poke through.  At this point, decide whether you'd like to add another layer of herbs to build up the tussie mussie. If so, add the layer and tie again with another rubber band.  This completes the tussie mussie, although it's a good idea to trim the stems to ensure that the base is even.	Select your favourite herbs and flowers. Place the flower or flowers in the centre of the arrangement. Use a rubber band to tie everything together at the top of the stems. Tie a ribbon bow around the stem.
Make sure to get as much supervised practice as you can. Commit to driving with an experienced driver before and after you get your driver’s license until you are comfortable driving by yourself. This way, you will have enough experience to drive safely on your own., Do this once you are comfortable driving during good weather conditions. Train for bad weather conditions by driving with an experienced driver while it is raining, snowing, foggy, or during other poor weather conditions.In general, avoid driving in extreme weather conditions whether you are an experienced driver or not.  The risk of getting into an accident or collision is three times higher during the night. Therefore, try to limit your night driving and avoid driving after midnight. In general, avoid driving at night until you are comfortable driving during the day.	Practice, practice, practice. Train for bad weather conditions. Limit driving at night.
Piggy back your tunes (use BINGO and Mary Had a Little Lamb, etc) and make up the words to suit every day activities. Put the spelling of their names to music and make it such a part of their lives that they cannot think without music being in their heads. If you play an instrument well, play it for them... often. Their brains can be "fine tuned" to (correctly) hear the music from a very young age.; , They will find that performing is fun. Most musical theater groups will perform in a low key and non-threatening way. A hardy round of applause will culminate in a desire to do more and to do better each time.  Get a voice coach that knows how to work with children.   At some point you are going to want them to join a children chorus. There is probably one in their school, so encourage them to join.  This will help your child understand music more, and make it easier for them to excel in singing lessons.  the radio, music in TV, and maybe some good tapes/CDs they might enjoy. A good idea is to put some classical music on their bedside when they go to sleep. Not so loud as they cannot sleep, but at a level in which they an still listen.  while doing chores, cooking meals, in the car to the radio etc. Sing songs your child knows and encourage them to join in.  This could include open mic nights, karaoke, talent shows, Etc. Before you do this however, watch talent shows on TV and see if your child shows an interest in that area. If so, then you can start taking them to different events  , Your manager will look for jobs that are available, make deals, and other such things.	Sing to them, all of the time, from when they are infants, to toddler age and higher. Involve them in musical theater classes at school or as an extra curricular activity. Invest in singing lessons, this will help improve your child's voice. Teach your child basic music theory (or get tutoring). Surround your child with music e.g. Be a good role model: Sing around the house i.e. As your child progresses and gets better, start exposing them to the public, even if they don't participate for the first few times. If you really want to get serious and want your child to have a career in singing, then get a manager.
Try large bark chips, osmunda fiber, large-size calcine clay, or tree fern fiber. Add small amounts of peat moss or vermiculite to hold water.; , There are various ways to obtain a young plant.   Cut or break off young side shoots or "pups" from an existing plant when they're half the size of the adult. Cut a dwarf pineapple fruit, leaving a little bit of the fruit attached to the topknot. Divide the "ratoons" (root parts) of mature plants.  Bromeliads in general prosper in the east, south, or west window where they can get 3 to 4 hours of full sun every day. Overall, dwarf pineapples require bright, warm conditions.  There's no need to water the growing medium because overflow from the cup is enough to do the trick. , If you don't harvest the pineapple, it will likely bloom into a flower.	Compose a loose, well-drained growing medium. Plant the dwarf pineapple in a pot with the growing medium. Put the plant in an indoor area where it will receive partial to full sunlight. Water the plant once a week by filling the cup or basin formed by the base of the leaves. Fertilize every 6-8 weeks with half-strength organic fertilizer during watering.  , Harvest the dwarf pineapples and then replant the top. Finished.
The type of yarn and hook you use for this border does not matter, but they need to match. To figure out what hook you need, buy your yarn first. Look at the label, and find the image with the crochet hook on it. It will tell you what size hook you need.  This triple picot has two small loops and one big one. It's composed of 3 chains, 5 chains, and then 3 chains, all in the same stitch., Slip your crochet hook through both loops of your first stitch. Make three chain stitches., Slip your hook through both loops of the first stitch. Make a slip stitch. This closes the chain, forming a loop., This will eventually form the middle picot, which will be a little bigger than the rest., Slip your hook through both loops of the first stitch. Make a slip stitch to close the chain. You should now have 2 picots in the same stitch., Crochet 3 chain stitches, then close the chain with a slip stitch in the first stitch., This will create the space between the triple picots and prevent them from bumping up against each other., Count 4 stitches from your picot. Make a slip stitch in the fifth stitch. This secures the chain to the border., Keep repeating the previous steps for the rest of the border.	Choose your yarn and hook. Chain 3 in the first stitch. Close the chain with a slip stitch. Chain 5 in the first stitch. Close the chain with a slip stitch. Make your final picot in the same stitch. Crochet three chain stitches for the gap. Skip 4 stitches, then make a slip stitch. Make your second triple picot.
There are lots of ways to interpret a beach theme, including nautical, rustic, and tropical. Each one will have its own set of colors, plants, and decorative elements. Choose one that appeals the most to you.; , Most beach themes will be bright and colorful, but if you are going with a nautical theme, you might want to use a limited color palette instead. A tropical theme might include lots of bright colors, while a rustic theme might use softer ones.  You can create a beach-themed garden just about anywhere—including in containers on a balcony and patio. The larger garden you have, the more options you will have. If you don't have a lot of space, however, you may not be able to plant some of the larger plants, such as palms.  Not all types of plants work for a beach-themed garden. At the same time, not all plants will be well-suited to the area that you live in. You will need to find a balance between the two by first finding beachy plants, and then selecting the ones that will flourish in your area.  Like all living things, plants require care. They need water, fertilizer, and pruning. Some plants, such as succulents, require a lot less care than others. If you don't have a lot of time to spare, consider selecting some low-maintenance plants for your garden.  This will help reign in some of your ideas, and may help you decide between two different plants, pebbles, and decor. If you live close to a beach, you might even be able to scavenge some rocks, shells, and driftwood, saving yourself some material costs.   Instead of buying expensive decorations, consider making your own!  , Plants found along beaches have to survive harsh conditions, with varying temperatures, strong winds, and salty air. They have to be drought-tolerant as well.Great beachy plants include:Beach strawberry Common thrift Gold coin Saffron buckwheat Seaside daisy  , Great coastal trees include coast banksia and eucalyptus. They act as natural buffers for smaller plants on real beaches, and can make your beach garden look more beach-like.Small palm trees, such as Mexican fan palms, are a great option for tropical beach-themed gardens and side gardens., Examples of bushy shrubs include: coastal rosemary, diosma, and woolly bush.Plant taller bushes towards the back of your plant bed. Use smaller bushes near the front as groundcovers and borders.  Not only are they beach-like, but they are also very hardy and don't require a lot of care. Great succulents include: agave, blue chalk sticks, and pigface (also called "ice plant").Plant different types of succulents together in batches for a variety of color and texture.  Skip the green, bushy lawns, and pick out some scruffy, drought-tolerant grasses instead.Great coastal grasses include: coast tussock grass, fountain grass, and orange sedge., Not only will this be more aesthetically pleasing, but it will also look more natural. Many coastal plants like to grow close together for protection against the coast's harsh winds and climate., After you have planted your flowers in their preferred soil, top it off with a layer of sand. You could also consider a crushed seashell blend or granitic sand instead., You can scatter these about randomly, or use them as borders for your garden.You could even use large shells (real or cement) as planters for small to medium-sized plants. Sea urchins make great planters for succulents and air plants.  Beautiful and organic, no two pieces are alike. You can make these special features in plant beds, or you can display them on your patio table instead.If you have any driftwood planks, you can use these as stepping stones to mimic paths found in beaches.  Add a hint of rustic by using twine to hang up baskets and planters. Wrap twine around mason jars or candle votives. Add a rustic touch to wooden furniture by winding twine around the joints to make them look as through they are handmade.   If you have a lot of sea shells at home, drill some holes into them, then string them onto a piece of twine to make a garland. Hang the garland on a wall or in a window., Brainstorm some items that might be found at a beach, and incorporate them into your garden. Things like surfboards, life savers, wooden oars, and ship wheels are all good bets. Clear, glass gazing orbs (not the mirrored king) would also work well because they mimic sea glass.  Another option is to use a synthetic wood made from recycled materials.Not only is this more environmentally friendly, but it also lasts longer.  You can also use white or unpainted wood furniture, and then add color with bright tablecloths, pillows, and cushions. , These do especially well in front yards.You can also put one in your backyard instead, however. When filling it, consider white pebbles, or glass—be sure to use the type meant for fire pits, however!  , If you want something more tropical, consider getting an awning made from straw or palm leaves instead. This would work great paired with a hammock and some tiki torches.  Candles are a great option for just about any garden, but you can also install other lighting features as well. For example:   If your have a tropical beach garden, consider getting some tiki torches. If you have a rustic garden, consider getting some mason jar lanterns instead.	Decide on a general theme. Choose a color scheme. Consider how much space you have. Consider the climate that you live in. Decide how much time and effort you are willing to commit. Have a budget. Focus on drought-tolerant plants, even if you live in a wet area. Consider getting a tree or two. Get some bushy shrubs to use as fillers. Make use of succulents. Plant grasses alongside succulents. Group your plants together. Fill plant beds with sand. Use sea shells, sea glass, and pebbles. Decorate with driftwood, sandstone, and other natural elements. Use twine as trim. Add other beach-themed decor items. Use wood for furniture and decking. Use bright, bold, solid colors.If you can't find furniture in the right color, you can easily paint it using outdoor-quality paint. Add some beach chairs or a hammock.For a more traditional look, use unpainted, wooden Adirondack chairs.For something more relaxed and tropical, consider a macramé hammock.  , Consider adding a fire pit. Add some shade with an umbrella. Don't forget the lighting!
Before you start building Guy Manuel's helmet you will want to measure your head. This will allow you to know what sizes your components will be and will ensure your mask fits. Measure your head carefully to avoid problems, allowing you to wear it comfortably once the mask is finished. There are a few measurements that you will need to take in order to get you started.Measure the circumference of your head. Use a cloth tape measure, looping it around the area of your head where a hat would rest, to get your head's circumference. Measure the length between the tip of your nose to the back of your head. You can use a standard ruler for this. Take a measurement between the top of your shoulder ridge and the top of your head. Use a standard ruler to measure the width of your head. This should be the distance between your temples. Record your measurements and use them to properly size the pieces of your helmet.  Before you can get started building your Daft Punk helmet you will need to gather your materials. It's important that you gather all the materials from the following list as you will be making use of all of them:Metallic gold spray paint and gold vinyl sheets. Clear acrylic globe. Heat gun. Something to cut with. Battery powered rainbow Christmas lights. LED belt buckle or name-tag Plastic lids. For example, you can use a lid from a peanut butter jar. Card stock or foam to build the sides of the mask. Wood glue to make the craft foam sturdy. Hot glue to hold things together. 1/16” aluminum flat bar for the mask's frame. Speaker wires. Dark smoke headlight tint-spray.  The acrylic globe will be used to create the visor of your mask. You will need to cut the globe to a certain shape and then bend it using a heat gun. This will create the proper shape and curvature of this Daft Punk mask visor.Cut off the sides of the globe to get an 8” mask visor. Stretch this piece using a heat gun so that it matches the shape of Guy's mask. Spray your visor with black car window tint-spray.  Cut out some strips of aluminum that will be used to build a basic frame for your mask. The frame won't be visible when the mask is finished. The frame is used to to hold things together while you work to build the rest of mask. You will only need two strips of aluminum to build your frame.Cut one strip for the bottom front of the frame. Cut another strip for the top and sides of the frame. Hold the frame together with glue. Attach your visor to the frame with glue. Make sure the measurements of this frame will fit the proportions of your head. The frame will be the main part that needs to fit your head.  To build the sides of the mask you will be cutting out layers of either foam or card-stock. These layers will form the shape of the mask as well as add support and strength to the mask's structure. Take your time and cut out shapes that closely match the shape of the original helmet, gluing them together to build the sides of the mask.Cutting out the mask sides from foam can be a quick way to build the mask sides. You can try layering card-stock to build the sides of the mask to the shape you want. Once you have built the sides of your mask you can attach them to the frame using glue. Add the circular jar lids to the sides of the mask to make the “ears”.  Now that your mask is assembled you can begin to add the metallic gold color to it. You will first need to spray paint the mask before applying the metallic gold vinyl sheets.Block off your mask's visor with painter's tape to prevent the gold paint from getting on it. Spray the mask with the gold metallic paint first. Make sure you've covered it completely. Once painted, apply the gold vinyl to finish the metallic look.  The lights will be added to the inside of the mask, using tape so that you can adjust them or remove them later on. You will need to add both the side lights and the front bottom “word” LED light. Keep the following tips in mind when creating your mask's lights:Rainbow Christmas lights can work for the sides. Place the lights in a column with their noses touching and hold this strip together with a tape backing. An LED belt buckle or nametag can be used for the “word” light that will go near the mouth of your mask. Attach the lights to the inside of your mask using tape or magnets. Make sure your lights are all battery powered.  Guy's mask has a bundle of wires that are visible at the back. Adding these wires will be the finishing touch on your own mask. These wires should be cut to a length that covers the back portion of the mask and can be attached using hot glue or other adhesive.These wires should lay flat against the mask. Make sure none of the wires are overlapping each other. Try to find wires that have a colorful outer coating.	Measure your head. Gather your materials. Cut and mold the acrylic globe. Build a simple aluminum frame. Build the sides of the mask. Color the mask gold. Add the lights. Add the wires.
In applicable situations, the first thing you should do for fires involving flammable liquids is to turn the fuel supply off.For instance, if a static discharge ignites gasoline around a fuel pump, the first thing you should do is hit the emergency shutoff valve located nearby at all pumping stations. This act severs the small fire from the very large fuel sources around it.   In many instances where the flammable liquid is the only fuel source, the fire may extinguish itself as soon as you cut the fuel supply.  You can also use a fire blanket on small Class B fires. If a fire blanket is readily available, this can be the easiest, least damaging method to extinguish it.   To use a fire blanket, remove from its packing, grip the unfolded blanket in front of you with your hands and body protected by it, and drape the blanket over the small fire. Do NOT throw the blanket at the fire. Ensure the fire is not too large for the blanket to smother it. Vegetable oil igniting in a frying pan, for instance, is a small enough fire for a fire blanket.  As with electrical fires, water-based (Class A) fire extinguishers should not be used on liquid or oil fires. Carbon dioxide (CO2) and dry chemical fire extinguishers will have a Class B rating.Check the label on the extinguisher and ensure that it says Class B before using it on a flammable liquid fire.   To use the extinguisher, pull any pin stopping you from depressing the handle, point the horn at the base of the fire, and hold down the handle.As you see the flames shrinking, approach the source and continue spraying until the fire is fully extinguished.If you cannot extinguish the fire within five seconds of using the extinguisher, then it’s too large.Evacuate to a safe place and call 911. The only exception to this rule when the liquid fire stems from vegetable oil or animal fats in commercial-size deep fryers and other restaurant equipment. The large size and extreme heat and fuel source of these devices get their own classification for fire extinguishers—Class K extinguishers.Restaurants with this type of equipment are legally required to keep a Class K extinguisher present.Do NOT throw water on liquid or oil fires. Water does not mix with the oil. When they are together, the oil stays on top of the water. The water will then boil and become steam 'very quickly.’ This quick boil is dangerous. Since the water is on the bottom of the oil, it sprays hot, burning oil in every direction as it boils off and evaporates. This then spreads the fire very quickly.  Even if the fire is out, you should still call 911.Smoldering objects can reignite, and proper firefighters will be able to isolate and remove any risks completely.	Shut off the fuel supply. Use a fire blanket to smother the fire. Use a Class B fire extinguisher. Call 911.
Remember to slip the first stitch of each row as if to purl and your decreases only happen on the right side (RS) of the work. Here's how:  Row 1: Loosely cast on 16 stitches, place marker, cast on a further 16 stitches (32 stitches in total). Row 2: Knit on the wrong side (WS). Row 3: Decrease row. Knit until you are 2 stitches before the marker. Knit the next two stitches together through the back of the loop and then knit to the end of the row (RS). Row 4: Knit WS. Repeat rows 3 and 4 until you are left with just 2 stitches on the needle (WS), pass the left stitch over the right stitch so you have just one stitch left and then fasten off.; , If you are not a fan of sewing squares together though, try picking up stitches.  Look at your square as a diamond with the top point being where you finished knitting and fastened off. You can add a square (actually a diamond) to the right and left sides, and then add a diamond between those two diamonds. This photo should help:        When starting diamonds that are on the right side of the blanket (like the green one), loosely cast on the first 16 stitches using the long tail cast on. Then place marker and pick up 16 stitches alongside of diamond to the left of the new one. For diamonds that are on the left edge of the blanket, pick up 16 stitches in the side of the diamond to the right, place marker, then loosely cast on 16 stitches using the cable cast on. For diamonds that are not on the edges, pick up 16 stitches from the side of the diamond to the right, place marker, pick up center stitch from the tip of the diamond below, pick up 15 stitches on the side of the diamond to the left. Rotate your work and you will end up with a nice square or rectangular blanket. , Perhaps a crochet edge would be nice.	Learn to make a mitered square. Sew each of your squares together any way you like.Continue until your blanket is finished. Add some decorative edging if you like.
While it may seem too obvious, the title is the first step in determining if this is a crochet pattern you want to try. The title will let you know if the pattern is for a scarf, a blanket or some other item. Sometimes, the title may also offer you clues to the difficulty of the pattern.; , Examine the pattern to determine if it is designed for beginner, intermediate or advanced-level crocheters. The difficulty is usually listed under the title. There is no reason to read through a pattern that is advanced if you are just beginning to learn to crochet.  Look to see what the finished measurements of the project will be. If it is a pattern for some type of wearable garment, the sizes that are available from this pattern will be listed.  Your pattern will tell you what type of yarn can be used and what the weight of the yarn should be. It will also tell you how much yarn you will need to complete the project. The crochet pattern will even tell you what size crochet hook to buy and if there are any other materials you will need to complete the project.  Gauge refers to amount of crocheted fabric that a specific hook size and yarn type will create. While the gauge is less important if you have an unending supply of yarn and aren't worried about the size of your completed project, most of the time you need to be aware of the size of your crochet stitches.   To check your gauge, crochet a swatch approximately 4 inches (10.2 cm) by 4 inches in the stitch pattern listed in the crochet instructions.If your gauge is larger than the gauge indicated in the pattern, try a smaller hook. If your gauge is smaller, try a larger hook.  You can look for tutorials on the Internet for any stitches you may be unfamiliar with. The basic stitch types include:chain slip stich single crochet half double crochet double crochet triple crochet  , Some crochet patterns list a key with abbreviations and their terms.Some patterns assume that you know what the abbreviations stand for. Some of the most common abbreviations include:ch=chain sl st=slip stitch sc=single crochet hdc=half double crochet dc=double crochet tc=triple crochet inc=increase dec=decrease  turn=turn your project over and start crocheting in the opposite direction join=connect two stitches together rep=repeat, It is common to encounter asterisks (*) in crochet patterns, so you need to know what they mean. Asterisks indicate that the steps provided need to be repeated in order until you reach the end of the row.For example, if you encounter instructions for a row that read: “Hdc in next 6 sts; *dc 2, sl st, dc in next st; rep from * to end,” then you will know that the instructions that follow the asterisk need to be repeated in order until you get to the end of the row.  Regardless what pattern you are crocheting, the first step is to make a slip knot on your hook. The pattern likely doesn't tell you to start with a slip knot, it's assumed you already know where to begin.Make a loop with the end of the yarn, and slip the loop onto the crochet hook. Wrap the yarn back over the crochet hook, and once again pull the yarn through the loop.Pull your crochet hook up with one hand while holding the other two ends of yarn to tie the slipknot tight.  The steps will begin by telling you how many chains to make.Then, the steps will be listed in order by number of rows or rounds. You will crochet Row 1 followed by Row 2, Row 3 and so on. Keep crocheting rows or rounds until you complete the project.   All crochet patterns begin with a foundation chain. The foundation chain could be long, as for an afghan, or short, as for a motif that begins as a circle.A pattern may be worked in rows back and forth to form a flat piece such as an afghan, or in rounds worked around to form a tube with no seams, such as in a hat.If the pattern directs you to turn the piece, flip it over so you are working from the opposite end. For example, you might keep the top side in the same position and switch the left end with the right end, flipping the top over., This number lets you know how many stitches you should be crocheting. You may need to add or drop a stitch to get back on track with the pattern.   It is a good idea to count your stitches once every 10 rows or so, just to make sure that you are on track with the pattern.  To stay on track with a pattern, it is important to keep track of the row that you are on by using a row counter, an app, or writing down your current row on a piece of paper.   Row counters fit right on the end of your hook and you will just need to click it forward each time you complete a row. Apps are available to help you keep track of your rows as well. To keep track of your rows using an app, you will need to tap the screen every time you finish a row. Pen and paper also work well for keeping track of your rows. You can simply write down your row number on the paper after you finish each row.  As you get ready to complete your project, check the finishing steps provided in your pattern to determine if the project needs to be sewn together or blocked. The finishing steps will often advise you about how to add accessories as well, such as buttons or ribbon.	Read the title of the crochet pattern. Check the pattern's difficulty. Determine the size of the finished project. Review the list of materials. Check your gauge. Identify any special terms or stitches that are used by this pattern.These are usually listed before the actual pattern begins. Interpret all the abbreviations that are given in the pattern. Repeat steps when you encounter an asterisk. Begin by tying a slip knot. Follow the steps of the pattern. Notice the number of stitches given at the end of the rows or rounds. Keep track of your rows. Refer to the finishing steps at the end of the pattern.
Note how it moves in and out of the pulley wheels, if there are any. Chains wrap around the derailleur (shifting device in the back of the bike) in a particular, but not difficulty to understand, patter you'll need to replicate later. Some chains are simply threaded on the gear.   If you work carefully you won't even need to remove the chain from the bike. But, depending where the link broke, there is a chance it slips off while cleaning or fixing. Take a quick picture now.; , The broken chain won't move, but the bike will be in soft, easy gears when you get it back on, as the extreme gears are the ones that tend to cause the chain to snap if it is weak.   If you only have one set of gears on this bike, you'll need a new chain link to proceed. The following method shortens the chain by a link, meaning it likely won't fit on your gears when finished., Use a toothbrush to get into the chainlinks, scrubbing off grime, rust, and dirt. A dirty chain is under much more stress than a clean one, and is much more primed to break. Clean it so that the chain links can move freely in your hands, paying attention specifically to any "stuck" or slow moving links. Clean the chain now to prevent fixing it again shortly.   If, even after cleaning, the chain is still rusty and stiff, you'll likely need a new chain. A rough, stiff chain can even damage your gears and derailleurs if left on for too long.  This tool, resembling a medieval torture device, is actually easy to use. Each link has two round pins in it, attaching it to the other links. Find the broken link, and note the pin that is keeping it attached to the rest of the chain. Slowly turn your chain break tool so the poker pushes the pin out of the link about halfway. Do not push it completely through.   If you have a spare pin (many chainbreakers come with one), then you should feel free to use this pin, as it will be much stronger and safer to ride on., Keep the pin still in the rest of the chain. You only want to remove the broken link, keeping the pin in the chain. This pin will attach to the open link on the other side of the chain to put everything back together., Before you fix the link, you need to get the chain onto the bike! Slide it through the pulley wheels they way you noted when you took the chain off. In general, the order is pretty intuitive, as there are small metal guards that hold the chain onto the gears. Simply thread the chain so that it stays between these guards and the pulley wheels.   To make pushing the pin in easier, turn the chain so that the exposed pin in the chain faces you, not the wheel., The link with the pin in it should be on the outside, so that you can push it through all four holes (two on each link) to complete your chain.  Before, you screwed the tool in to push the pin out of the link. Now you'll be screwing the tool in to push the link though. Work slowly, keeping your hand on the links to ensure it is all lined up.  It can also help to move the chain tool to the other side of the joint just made, and push the pin very slightly to free the two outside plates of the link from the central section, preventing binding.  Do not use WD-40, or any other product not made for bike chains. Flip the bike over and pedal it with one hand, dropping bits of lubricant onto the chain with the other. 10-15 drops should do. Then, use a damp rag and lightly pat down the chain of any excess oil. When you run a finger on the chain it should come up slick, but not covered in a puddle of lubricant.  More often than not, the bike won't even let you get into these gears, as the chain is not long enough to reach. However, the strain of trying to hit these bigger cogs will cause another break if you aren't careful.   Try to keep your chain straight between the front and back gears. Don't let it stretch diagonally across the gears by being all the way to the right on the front gears and all the way to the left on the back gears at the same time. This chain fix is generally temporary, and you should add a new link or get a new chain shortly afterward.	Take a picture, draw out, or memorize how the chain is currently attached. Shift the bike into the middle gears in both the front and back, noting which gears you're on. Remove the broken chain and clean it with a degreaser and water. Use a chainbreak tool to carefully push the pin halfway out of the broken link. Pull the broken link off the pin and discard. Thread the chain back onto the bike the way it came off. Fit the two end of the chain into one another so the holes line up. Use your chainbreak tool in reverse to push the pin through, completing the link. Grab the chain on each side of your newly connected links and move it from side to side to loosen up the new connection. Lubricate your chain with bike grease. Avoid using your biggest gear in the back gears, as the chain is now a link too short.
Inspect it for cracks. Discard if cracked as it will let the soil and water run out. If it's okay, wash it until clean, then dry completely.; , Tape the paper face to the bucket.   You can varnish the face too, if liked. This creates a waterproof outer.  Sprinkle grass seeds on top. Cover lightly with soil.  Soon you'll see grass popping up. Once it starts growing, it'll usually thrive.  Keep it well maintained. The kids will enjoy keeping the grass buddy's "hair" neat and at the same time, learn a lesson in tending to something growing.	Select a suitable plastic paint bucket. Draw a face on a piece of paper. Fill the bucket with potting soil. Water a tiny bit every day. Trim the grass regularly.
Most take at least 512 MB of RAM to run. However, at the minimum requirements, your notation software will run slowly and may experience errors. If you are planning to buy a new computer to use for composing sheet music, look for a computer with around 2 GB of RAM and 2 GHz processing speed. Finale and Sibelius are available for both the Mac and Windows XP.; , In order for your notation software to communicate with your synthesizer, your MIDI interface needs to be installed first. Your USB audio-MIDI interface will come with software and information from the manufacturer to help with the installation.  TASCAM makes a low-cost USB audio-MIDI interface called the US-122 that will help you get started in some notation software. However, Sibelius is only compatible with a few external MIDI devices. Check with your software manufacturer to make sure that your MIDI interface is compatible with your notation software. , This setup will allow your computer to sync with your synthesizer to record MIDI tracks on your notation software.  To do this, open the hardware setup function of your notation software and select the interface device as your active MIDI device. On most notation software, the hardware settings are under Edit or Tools in a section called Setup, Preferences or Options.  Add a track into your notation software and record some MIDI keystrokes from your synthesizer.  Then, create a track and enable it for recording.  When you are done with the track, press stop. , Double-check the parts by listening to them using your notation software's playback function.  You can choose to print the music in various sizes, as a conductor's score, in sections or individually by instrument.	Check your computer to make sure it can run notation software. Install your USB audio-MIDI interface. A USB audio-MIDI interface lets you connect audio input feeds and MIDI feeds to your computer. Install your notation software.  , Plug your synthesizer's MIDI-Out to the MIDI-In on your audio-MIDI interface, and the synthesizer's MIDI-In to the MIDI-Out on your audio-MIDI interface. Direct your notation software to recognize the MIDI coming from your synthesizer through the audio-MIDI interface device. Test your hardware installation. Start a new file. Begin recording on your notation software as you play the part you wish to record. Check the track for any errors and use the notation software's editing tools to clean up timing, clarify notation markings and fix any errors you might have made while playing the synthesizer.  , Repeat until you have recorded and cleaned up parts for all of the instruments that you wanted to include in your musical composition. Print your sheet music.
When you have a small space, everything in it counts. By arranging your furniture to open up your floor space, you can make your room look bigger. If you don’t have a lot of room, place your larger pieces of furniture near the edges of your room, not in the middle.Sometimes, if you have a few smaller pieces of furniture, you can place these pieces away from the walls. Placing a piece at a diagonal angle toward the middle of your room can give the illusion of space. Place your bed in a corner of your bedroom to open up the floorspace. Push your couch up against a wall in your living room to provide an open floor and pathway. One element of a larger looking room is the ability to move freely about it. Don’t place any furniture in areas that would block a view or ability to easily move about the space.; , The more furniture you have in any room, the more cramped and smaller it will look. Keep a small room tidy and organized. Start with what you need in a room, these are usually the bigger pieces of furniture like a bed or couch.   If you have a smaller room, consider only having a couple pieces of furniture in it. Use this piece of furniture to create a focal point. This is one area that draws the eye to it. In your living room, this could be your couch and table. Don’t add unnecessary chairs and knick-knacks, these will only clutter your space. Don’t hang too many paintings or pictures on your wall. Having a lot of items on your walls creates a cluttered look that makes the space feel more cramped.  Place your bureau next to the bed and use it as a nightstand. Look for furniture that serves more than one purpose. Get a bed frame that has pull out drawers or is elevated enough to place storage boxes under.   Use a chest as a living room table. It provides a surface to place things on, but also opens up allowing you to store blankets and pillows inside. Grab a storage ottoman. If you need an ottoman, get one with a lid to keep things out of sight when you don’t need them. Use an extra kitchen chair as a small bedside table., Get furniture that has open legs, or tables that are glass. Furniture that is elevated with legs makes a room look bigger because it creates more air.Furniture with legs or glass tables allow light to travel around, through, and under the piece, opening up the space. Attach a folding shelf beneath a window to use as a desk or ironing board. You can fold the desk up when you don’t need it Ditch the drapes and rugs when you can. Keep a space uncluttered and allow more light in by removing your drapes and rugs. Keeping your windows open allows for more light and depth to your room. A rug with the right pattern can make your room look bigger, but it can also separate parts of the room, making it seem more cramped.	Rearrange your furniture. Keep a small room sparse. Make use of hidden storage and multi-purpose furniture. Keep your furniture open.
Take a flat screwdriver and use it to turn the screwdriver slot and shut off the water from the flushometer.  You may also need to take a cover off where the screwdriver slot is too.; , You only need a wrench to loosen the top lid of the flushometer. After that, the lid screws right off.  It may also be necessary to use a piece of paper when doing so, so that you don't scrape the chrome on the flushometer.  Be warned that you may make a mess with some water when taking this cover off.,  There also may be a tiny weep hole too, which is what is causing the suction to release and the vacuum to seal up, also causing the flushometer to not be able to stop running the water into the toilet.  Clean it really well. You also will want to wash it out too.  Something very tiny in width should be used to clean the port of the weep hole. ,	Depending on whether your flushometer is facing left or right, there should be a slot for a flat screwdriver on either side. Take a wrench and screw the top lid of the flushometer off. Take the flange cover off. You will now see a gasket, which will have a lot of sediment. Take out and clean the gasket, including the weep hole.Follow steps 1 to 5 in reverse order (skipping the cleaning part, as you have already cleaned) to get the toilet working again, leaving it good as new.If this solution didn't work, you will need to replace the gasket.
Many libraries require you to present proof of residency in order to get a library card. Before you head to the library, gather two pieces of mail with your given name and address on them, such as a bank statement or utility bill.For children or teenagers, a parent’s proof of residency is usually requested.  Once you’ve proven residency, you need to prove you are who you say you are. Your library branch will require some form of ID. Although this is typically a state-issued license or ID, students may be able to use their school ID cards, as well., Libraries do not issue library cards online, so make sure you locate and visit your local library in person with the required documents. If you live outside of the area, you may also be required to pay a yearly fee.Although using online catalogs is possible, you have to have a library card before you can use library resources.  While at the library, set up your online library profile. This typically uses your library card barcode and a password of your choosing. Creating an online library profile is required to check out items digitally.   The way to set up your online account varies from library to library. Some will have simple instructions, while others will require a librarian to complete the process for you.	Gather two pieces of mail with your name and address. Take your state-issued ID. Visit your local library. Set up your online library profile.
This is the first and foremost thing you need to do. Once you feel you have the confidence to move forward, then you move to the next step.  This is most important if you want to have a chance to form a garage band that will stay together. Life expectancy of a garage band is 1 year. Many garage bands stay together for decades. This is because they all think the same way and as a band and a not individuals. Always think what is best for the band.  One cannot have a garage band without one. If you have a garage, empty the cars out of it. If the cars are already out of it, empty out sporting equipment, and ten foot wide paintings. A basement might work as well, however it creates problems for the drummer and when lugging a 25 pound amplifier down 70-year old wooden steps. Besides, garages are so much cooler. Having rugs lying around will help reduce the bass vibrations going all over the place. Make sure there is electricity and some dim lighting for setting a depressing non-conformist mood.  The most important part of creating a rock band. You need instruments to play, and although not always mandatory, you will greatly benefit by knowing how to play it, as explained in detail in step three. Necessary instruments are a drum set, Electric Guitar, and Bass. You may elaborate, adding another guitar, keyboard, organist, or solo singer. individual background singers are strongly unadvised, due to the high level of un-garageness. Although cheap instruments might look unattractive in the store, they're a bargain for your buck and add to the "grunge" appeal of your garage band. Stay away from fancy and "professional" equipment, as they also have a high level of un-garageness. For instance, buying a real Fender Strat could cost you up to $1200, what kind of Garage rocker would you be if you had that kind of money I ask you? Instead, go to a pawn shop and buy a $50 Strat rip-off missing a fret or two, and put some stickers on it.  The same rule basically applies to gear (amps, mics, pedals, etc.) as to instruments. Do not worry about getting cheaper gear, as long as it works and plays a decent sound. However, do not get too small an amp. You want something at least maybe 10"x10", as smaller amps subtract from the garage band feel, and are suited more for country-rock playing in the subway.  The name of your band might decide the fate of you. The name for your band may come in a variety of ways. It never hurt to have a cool name, it may be totally instantaneous, or you may lock yourself in a room for a week, using that as a source of inspiration. Whatever you do, make it sound unusual and unprecedented, try to think of something that would never happen like The Flying Hippos or something like "Sex Pistols" or "Nine Inch Nails" or "Slipknot". When choosing a name, it's wise to have something that either is so out there that people automatically want to listen, or maybe something ironic or vulgar, to attract attention in other ways  , Showing off your rock knowledge skills to everyone might increase your garage band stature. However, there are things to say and things not to say. Do not say, "Did you know that Jimi Hendrix was born Johnny Allen Hendrix at 10:15 a.m. on November 27, 1942?" Do say, "Did you know Jimi Hendrix died by choking on his vomit?" Instead of "Did you know that Ozzy had two #1 Albums with Black Sabbath," you could say, "When he was solo, he toured with Motley Crue, and one time on this bus, Vince Neal snorted an ant, and then to prove that he was more hardcore, Ozzy pissed on himself and licked it off".	Learn how to play your instruments. Find like minded musicians. Get a Garage. Have instruments. Buy gear. Name the band: Choose wisely. Immerse yourself in rock knowledge.
Do not plant an Ohia tree over 9,000 ft (2,743 m) in elevation. Ohia trees are not suited for high elevations, and will likely wilt and die if planted too high.Higher elevations likely have too little oxygen in the atmosphere to sustain an Ohia tree, and may not have enough humidity.  If you live in an area above 9,000 feet (2,743 m), consider finding a different species of tree to plant.; , Ohia trees need near-constant sunlight during daylight hours, and so should be planted in an open space that affords plenty of light.Do not plant your Ohia tree near a large wall or building that will block the sun. Similarly, do not plant the Ohia near a larger tree or bush whose foliage will prevent sun from reaching the Ohia.  Young Ohia trees and bushes that have not fully grown may prefer partial sun (about 6 hours of sun exposure a day), until they reach maturity. If your Ohia is in the ground, you won’t be able to change its sun exposure as it matures. However, if the Ohia tree is in a planter, you can move the planter to keep the juvenile tree in partial sunlight.  Ohia trees will become unhealthy if the soil they are planted in becomes saturated and waterlogged. To avoid this problem, plant your Ohia in a soil with good drainage. The soil should also be rich in organic material, which will nourish the growing Ohia tree and keep it healthy.You can purchase a planting soil mixture at your local hardware store, or at a local plant nursery or gardening center. Ask the sales staff for assistance, and request that they help you find a soil that drains well.  Unlike various other tree species, Ohia trees can be grown from seeds relatively easily.If you live in Hawaii, you should be able to purchase Ohia seeds or a small seedling at a local plant nursery or gardening center. If you live elsewhere, you can order Ohia seeds online. Check with plant retailers that specialize in Hawaiian flora, including Maui Native Nursery and Kauai Seascape nursery.  The seeds of the Ohia tree are tiny, and a cluster of them may look like a small pile of dust. These seeds grow in ¼-inch (0.65 cm) pods on the Ohia tree. The seed pods burst open when they have matured, and allow the seeds to disperse.  Fill any size planter with a planting soil mixture, and lightly sprinkle the tiny Ohia seeds on top of the soil. Ohia seeds will grow best if exposed to plenty of sunlight, so place the planter outdoors, away from shade. Water the seeds lightly at first, with a spray bottle, until they start to sprout.Even if you’re unable to place the Ohia seeds in full sunlight, they’ll likely still grow. The seeds are tough and can grow in practically any light conditions. The seeds will grow best between 50°F and 93°F (10–34°C). If the outdoor temperatures dip below 50 or climb above 93, bring the plant indoors to more stable temperatures.  If you can obtain a cutting from an Ohia tree in your area (perhaps from a tree owned by a friend or family member), you can use this to grow your own Ohia. Plant the Ohia cutting in soil that is porous and drains well, so the cutting isn’t drowned by repeated waterings.If the cutting is too small to stand erect in a pot full of soil on its own, you can stick a large dowel in the soil and tie the cutting to the dowel using thread.  Take your cutting from the stem or branch tips of a mature Ohia tree. The cutting that you plant should be about 4-6 inches (10-15 cm) in length, and ¼-inch (0.65 cm) in diameter. A cutting will take time to begin establishing its own roots: at least a week or two.  Once the young Ohia tree (whether grown from seeds, a cutting, or a seedling) has begun to grow, you’ll need to transplant it from a pot directly into the ground. Plant the Ohia in organic soil. Ohia roots need to be able to absorb water but should never become waterlogged, so plant the tree in soil that drains well and is not prone to forming puddles.Ohia trees grow quickly, and will become root-bound if left in a pot for too long. Put the plant in soil in the ground as soon as it grows large enough to encourage healthy growth, or about 1 foot (0.3 meters) tall.  The Ohia roots will have sufficient room to expand in a hole of this size. Make the hole roughly the same depth as the root ball, so that the trunk of the seedling will not be buried once it’s planted.While you’re digging, turn the soil by breaking apart clumps, removing rocks, and flipping the shovelfuls of soil upside down so that the organic material can be worked through the soil. For added soil drainage, place a couple of cinder blocks at the bottom of the hole to allow for soil drainage. You should be able to purchase cinder blocks at a local hardware or landscaping store.  Once the cinder blocks are firmly in place, gently set the Ohia tree in the hole and cover the roots with a rich soil mixture. Be sure not to cover the base of the trunk with soil., Ohia trees thrive in tropical environments, and consequently need to be watered often. Plan to water your Ohia tree at least once a week, using water from a household hose. In order to keep the tree healthy and encourage its growth, you can also apply a fertilizer. Purchase an 8-8-8 or 13-13-13 fertilizer, and apply it to the base of the Ohia tree once every six months.Hours after watering, make sure that the soil is draining well. You should not see any puddles around the base of the Ohia tree, and the soil should be damp but not saturated.  Since Ohia trees frequently produce large, pleasant-smelling flowers, bees and other pollinating insects frequent the trees. Ohia trees are almost constantly in bloom, and so constantly attract insects.If you’re bothered by the bees or wasps, you can set up a bee trap or occasionally spray bees with an insecticide like Raid.  Also, avoid planting an Ohia tree within 10 feet (3 meters) of a door or garage. If large numbers of bees or wasps are frequently in the tree, they may fly into your house.  If you’re planning on growing more than a single Ohia tree, you don’t need to worry about giving the trees plenty of space in every direction, as with some other species. Ohia trees can grow well while crowded together. Plant multiple Ohia trees with as little as about 5 feet (1.5 meters) between their trunks.Over the years, as the Ohia trees grow, you may decide to prune some of the trees’ branches. Prune using a pair of pruning shears, in cases where branches from two Ohia trees overlap.	Avoid locations with high altitudes. Choose an area that gets full sunlight. Make sure that your soil has good drainage. Purchase Ohia seeds or a seedling. Plant your Ohia seeds. Plant an Ohia cutting. Re-plant an Ohia cutting or seedling into rich soil. Dig a hole that is twice as wide as the root ball. Place the seedling in the hole and cover it with soil. Water and fertilize the Ohia tree. Remove unwanted insects from the tree. Plant multiple Ohia trees near one another.
Before you start, you should unplug the dryer to prevent accidents. The plug is usually located behind the machine. Test it to be sure that you have unplugged it correctly.  Using a spatula or an old credit card, scrape any large pieces of crayon that may be left off of the dryer drum.  Get an old rag and spray it with WD-40.You should be very sure not to spray the drum itself with the WD-40, just the rag.  Use the rag to wipe at the spots covered in crayon. Try not to cover any more area with the WD-40 than you have to. This should allow you to remove all of the crayon without too much difficulty.   Switch which part of the rag you wipe with frequently to keep from spreading the crayon any more.  Once you've removed all of the crayon, or at least as much as you can, you'll want to mix up a bucket with soapy water and use a sponge or washcloth to clean the WD-40 out of the drum. Pay extra attention to the spots with the WD-40.  With the dryer rinsed out, run a load of old towels through a cycle in the dryer to remove any crayon which might still remain.	Unplug the dryer. Scrape off any large remaining crayon. Spray a rag with WD-40. Wipe down the affected area. Clean the inside with soap and water. Run a cycle with old towels.
Find whether the sky is clear enough to do stargazing, also be aware of the temperature and humidity conditions and prepare adequately with the right clothing, equipment, etc.   A forecast for a completely clear, dry night means you'll probably be free of subtle haze. A breeze can mean less pollution near a city, but strong wind can be chilly.; , But an early setting or late rising moon may make this moot. Even with the moon, you can see bright things like the planets and bigger meteors in a shower.  You can stargaze anywhere provided the sky is clear and there is little light interference. (Some light from each source scatters throughout the atmosphere to interfere with the stars even if you're looking away from the light source.) It's best to head away from cities and large towns to where it is dark enough. Suitable places tend to be on higher hills (there might be some nearby), mountainous areas and desert-like rural areas.So, you'll need some way of getting to a good spot (bike, car, a lift from someone else). Another benefit of these out-of-the-way locations is that they're usually very relaxing.   Downtown in a big city, you won't see many stars. (If you see only two or three, they're probably planets.) In suburbs and small cities, you can see constellations. In rural areas without lights in your field of view, you can see the Milky Way.  Unless it's a hot summer's night, most outdoor night experiences will come with cool to cold air, and this can put a real dampener on wanting to stay outdoors for too long.   For winter or cold weather, the appropriate wear would include: A coat, hat, boots, mittens or gloves, and layers of warm clothing.For heavy-duty cold weather watching, you may also need thermal underwear, long-sleeved thermal t-shirt, thermal socks, a pouch for warming hands, face mask, insulated boots, and hand and foot warmers.For summer or warmer nights, the appropriate wear would include: A jacket or cardigan, long pants, long sleeved shirt, and possibly layers depending on the night temperature. It's a good idea to stargaze from home at first, if possible. That gives you plenty of opportunities to rush back into the house to adjust the warmth of your clothing if needed. You can then use this experience for stargazing trips that take you farther afield.  When you're out and about at night, there are a few things to be careful about when stargazing, to ensure that your experience remains both safe and comfortable:   Your visibility is clearly reduced, so you'll need to have your own source of light. Take along a quality flashlight or a headlight that is able to light up paths, terrain, and show possible snags like tree roots, rocks, etc. if you're heading along a trail to a stargazing spot. You can attach red cellophane to your flashlight to help your eyes adjust better to the darkness or get one that already has a red LED.You can even start this process by wearing sunglasses indoors before leaving, so that there is a gradual reduction of light on your eyes. Depending on where you are, you might also need to take along bug repellent. Remember that some insects like mosquitoes are night feeders, so you can be at higher risk for some diseases if you're stargazing where such insects tend to be found. Know the area where you're stargazing. You're somewhat vulnerable laying around staring nerdily at the sky at night, often with conspicuously expensive gadgets, so be sure that the area is safe. If you're not in your own backyard or on your own property, it is wise to be stargazing with someone else. Take a map if you're headed somewhere you don't normally go to, along hiking trails etc. A guide might also be helpful if you're doing some remote stargazing. Tell someone what you're doing and where you're headed if you're stargazing away from home. Give an estimated time of arrival back home and take along your cell phone. That way, they can keep an eye for you and can follow you up if you don't come back when you said you would. If you're a minor, always tell a parent or responsible adult what you're doing. If you're stargazing near a road or parking area, make sure you're far away enough and conspicuous enough not to get run over by a careless driver. Your car should be well away from traffic too, but you might want it between you and the direction from which danger might come.  You could simply turn your head up to the sky and stare but do that for too long and your neck will protest mightily! The most comfortable way to stargaze is to lie back and watch the heavens unfold before you; and you can also try sitting and looking up. To enable a more comfortable experience, try the following suggestions:   Bring along a folding chair or a reclining lawn chair to sit on. You won't strain your arms if you are stargazing using binoculars, nor your legs from standing too long. You can place a sleeping bag across a lawn chair for both comfort and added warmth. If you wish to sit or lie down on the grass, put out a lined picnic rug to prevent the cold from the ground seeping up. In addition, over this place a padded mat or a blanket. You can also bring along a cushion and sit on it and maybe a blanket to wrap around you. If sitting, place your legs out straight. This will let the blood in the veins flow or else your legs will go numb. Depending on how long you intend to stay outside for, the addition of a propane heater can make your stargazing experience more enjoyable. Be sure to keep it away from the telescope though as the glow and less-dense warm air rising from it (and within your telescope, if that gets warmed too) can distort the view.You'll need to be able to tote your gear with you; get a good day-pack, so that you're not overwhelmed by carrying things. A reclined front seat in an opened convertible is perfect if you're not using a telescope (the car is on springs, so it would wobble). Turn the car off and put on a blanket to stay warm.  Some things will make your stargazing experience a lot more enjoyable if you have them, especially if you want to see more of the stars than what the naked eye can see.   Deep-watch the sky using binoculars or a telescope. Do some broad-ranging research on which type of stargazing equipment to sink your money into before buying. You might prefer to borrow a friend's telescope or pair of binoculars and see what you like and don't like first. Bring along a compass to help you find things in the night sky, including reference stars by which to initially orient a "go-to" telescope. Or, better yet, use an automated sky map such as the smartphone application Google Sky Map: the GPS and orientation sensors will automatically choose a map for the direction in which the phone faces. A star chart or map is a wise choice for stargazers – try to find one that is laminated and that glows in the dark as this will be the easiest one to read and handle. A suitable camera for astrophotography if you like. It's relatively easy to photograph the moon or star trails.  Comfort definitely involves staying nourished and some warm drinks like hot cocoa, hot tea or coffee, or other favorite drinks are an ideal addition to your pack. Also take along something to nibble on, like energy or snack bars, some homemade cookies or cake, and perhaps some nuts or chocolate. Trail mix is another good option but be careful not to eat too much as you're not exactly hiking!   If it's a romantic evening, bring along champagne and truffles! Not too much unless you have a designated driver.  Your eyes need anywhere from five to thirty minutes or so to adjust to the light (or lack of it) in your chosen stargazing spot.Set up your spot and simply relax for a few minutes and hopefully by this time, your eyes should be ready to start stargazing. Start anyway, and expect more stars to come into view as your eyes continue to adjust. Enjoy your stargazing – amateur astronomers have just as much chance, if not more chances, of finding amazing new cosmic discoveries as the professional astronomers due to the time and dedication available.If you find it hard to spot faint stars, try using "averted vision". Look just to the side of what you're trying to see. Your peripheral vision is most sensitive to light and dark, making it easier to see faint objects when the rest of the sky appears gray.Consider keeping an observation log of all that you see. This will enable you to make comparisons, find anomalies, and build up a record over time.	Watch the weather reports, Forecast the Weather Using Clouds, or log-on NOAA.GOV (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration), the authority that meteorologists use, and enter your zip code on the main page. Check the phase and rising and setting times of the moon.The light scattered from a bright moon will likely obscure the stars too much for a good stargazing experience. Choose a suitable location. Focus on staying warm. Think safety. Consider your bodily comfort. Take along the right stargazing equipment. Prepare drinks and snacks. Give your eyes a time to adjust.

Check the grammar on your profile to be sure it is understandable. Also, keep your personal information private and away from the Internet's eyes.  Click on the button "forum."  , As you scroll down the page, you will see a list of clans with the board titled "The Main Game." Join one of these boards, or select "Fan Clans, Tribes, and Loner Lands." Find a thread that has an appealing story and set of characters to you.  Often, it contains important facts about the plot, as well as additional rules for the roleplay. The owner may require you to sign up for the roleplay on a separate thread, or he may allow you to jump into the story. You will also be expected to create a character in order to participate. Be sure that you meet all the necessary requirements for the roleplay.  Be sure that you follow the appropriate roleplaying rules. Learn to get along with the other players.  When you first begin roleplaying, your posts may not be as complex as those who have had more experience. Your sentences may be short and to the point. Although some people may ridicule you for your simple style, never be ashamed of it. As you roleplay more frequently, you will learn to adapt to the different writing styles. The harder you work on writing, the more you will improve until you too can write complicated posts.   As a person new to roleplaying, your writing may sound like this:  Burnshadow awoke and went out of his den to find his leader. His leader told him he needed to make a hunting patrol. Burnshadow went out with Riversky and Bluepaw and hunted in his territory. He came back with a lot of prey and went back to his den to sleep.  Rather than repeating the same word in your post, use a thesaurus to find descriptive synonyms that add flavor to your writing. Although you should avoid using too many big words, insert semi-advanced vocabulary words into your sentences for a colorful post.  Rather than simply stating them as they are, add more style and uniqueness to them by including detail. Detail is the key to capturing attention of readers, as it helps draw people into your writing. Although you should refrain from including too much, don't be afraid to lengthen simple actions. For example, if your character woke up and walked out of the den, you could say:   The sunlight pierced through the den. Burnshadow jerked awake with a meow, squinting into the searing rays. He slowly stretched his paws out and winced at the ache from his stiff sleep. Yawning, he rolled his neck before shooting out of his nest in search of his leader.  Instead of constantly using his name or pronouns, replace it with a short description of him. For example, replace "Burnshadow" with "the rowan-colored tom." This adds an interesting mix into your post, and it gives your readers an idea of your character's appearance. For example:   The rowan-colored tom padded into the Warrior's den. His eyes darted from nest to nest before focusing on his den-mate Riversky. The black cat was stretched out on his belly, a white paw tucked against his nose. With a soft sigh, Burnshadow padded over to the tom and nudged his head until his eyes blearily opened.  Showing rather than telling the scenes unfolds a new world for your readers. They will be able to see your characters come to life in front of them. You will also be able to weave your characters' personalities into their words using different tones and speaking habits (ex: A shy cat might speak more hesitantly while a bold cat may have more to say). Although descriptive sentences can be helpful when telling a story, you may need to break up your paragraphs with some dialogue to keep your readers' interest going.   For example, "Riversky, wake up!" could be an appropriate substitute for "Burnshadow asked Riversky to awaken." Beware of too much dialogue. Use enough to keep the story flowing, but avoid dumping too much information into conversations. Keep them short and to the point, writing them as naturally as a normal person would speak.  An emotional character provides the opportunity for readers to bond with him. Without feelings, a story would become uninteresting since people won't be able to empathize with its characters. Describe your character's emotional reaction to major events, but beware of revealing too much at a time. Learn to convey his feelings through his actions as well so that your story continues flowing.   For example, "A terrible scream shook the den. Fear gripped Burnshadow's heart. He froze in his nest, claws sliding out as his heart leaped into his throat."  , Delete unnecessary descriptions that distract readers from your story. Learn to be moderate in what you type. Remove extraneous details, and include additional descriptions where it is necessary. Keep your grammar at a top-notch level by using spellcheck or running a careful eye over your posts. Although it may take more time and effort, don't hesitate to stray from simple sentences and lengthen your posts.   Accept criticism. Rather than allowing it to discourage you, take the opportunity to extract as many lessons from it as possible. Learn to improve your posts as time goes on. The more constructive advice you accept, the better your writing will be.  Read the responses to your character's actions, and reply to them with an additional post. As time continues on, gather as much advice as you can in order to improve your writing. Perhaps one day you'll be able to start your own roleplay.	Head to the website's homepage.

Every time you tap your brakes, the cars behind you will do the same. This can cause a ripple effect for miles down the road. Try to keep a gap between you and the car ahead of you. If another car slows down or tries to merge, you should have enough room to slow down without braking suddenly.Keep at least two or three seconds between you and the car in front of you. This means that it should take you two or three seconds at your current speed to reach the other car.; , Try to stay at the speed limit, or go at the speed of traffic. If you need to slow down, take your foot off the gas, and do not brake unless you need to. In many cases, if you keep a gap between cars, you may be able to slow down without braking.When there's an accident or a breakdown on the side of the road, do not slow down to look. Instead, keep going at the rate of traffic.Cruise control can help you maintain a steady speed on the highway.  The more you change lanes, the more other cars may have to slow down to accommodate you. While you may sometimes need to move over, try changing lanes only when necessary., By letting cars in the merge lane come into your lane, you’re helping the flow of traffic. If you see cars trying to merge, allow a gap between you and the car ahead of you so that they have room to enter., Stay alert by scanning ahead as far as you can. Remain aware of what is happening around you. Watch for road hazards, accidents, bottlenecks, or other problems along the road.Many highways have signs that will alert you of delays or traffic jams. You can either prepare to slow down or find an alternate route.  Do not text, read the news, check your social media page, or take your eyes off of traffic, even if traffic has stopped dead. Always watch what is happening in front of you. You never know when traffic will start moving again.  If you are bored, turn on music or try a podcast.  If your car begins to break down, move to the slow lane, slow down, and pull over as soon as it's safe to do so. Turn on your hazard lights, and use your cell phone to get help immediately.If you are on the side of a busy highway, you should remain in your car. If you must exit, exit on the passenger’s side to avoid getting hit by a car.	Maintain a gap between cars. Stay at a consistent speed. Avoid changing lanes too often. Allow other drivers to merge into your lane. Pay attention to the road conditions. Avoid taking your eyes off the road. Pull over quickly and completely if you have a problem.
You can purchase your fabric from your local fabric store. If you don’t have a fabric store near you, you can order it online.   Fabric stores usually have a discount section. If you’re on a budget, check there first. You will need about one yard (36 inches) of fabric so that you have plenty of material to wrap around your head and tie in the back. You can use any type of fabric, such as cotton, linen, or rayon. However, these fabrics will fray on the edges. Other fabrics, such as jersey knit, faux leather, or vinyl will not fray. Of these, knit fabric will likely be the easiest to find in the color you need (and less expensive than the others).; , Be sure that the strip of fabric you cut is about 3 inches (7.6 cm) wide and however long you need to wrap around your head. Leave enough extra to tie off behind your head.   It would be a good idea to measure around your head first and determine the length you would like your headband to be. Be sure to cut your edges straight. Lay out your fabric on a flat surface and use a measuring stick and chalk to create an outline for your headband.  If you have opted for a fabric that frays around the edges after being cut (such as cotton), you can apply an anti-fray aerosol spray to the edges to make your headband last longer and prevent wear and tear., You can use cardboard, poster board, or an aluminum can for a more authentic look.  If you are using cardboard or poster board, grab a measuring stick and trace an approximately 2 inch (height) by 6 inch (length) rectangle. Round each of the four corners. If you are using a recycled aluminum can, wash and dry the can first. Take some scissors and create a slit lengthwise down the center of the can (from top to bottom). Carefully cut around the top and bottom of the can and discard those pieces. Take the aluminum from the middle of the can and bend it back and forth to smooth it out.Measure and cut your aluminum (approximately 2 inches by 6 inches with rounded corners).  (Skip this step if you have used aluminum.) Choose a silver paint with a metallic finish, and but be sure to allow plenty of time for it to dry. Paint only on the side that will be visible once it is applied to your fabric.  Use a marker to draw the emblem of your choice in the center of your cardboard or aluminum piece.   If you are worried about making a mistake, trace the image with a pencil first. Don’t press down too hard, though, because the indentations will still show in your cardboard or aluminum.  If you don’t want your fabric to show through your emblem, use a permanent marker to draw the circles instead of cutting them.   Alternately, you could cut the backs off of six round, silver thumb tacks and glue them to the sides of your emblem plate.  When you are satisfied with the plate, apply super glue to the back of the plate.

Before tying the knot, you may add a charm to the bracelet for additional flare.,	Cut the leather or suede cord. Thread the needle. Sew a row of beads in between the folded-in-half cord. Finish the ends of the bracelet. Finished.
It is important to know what phase the moon is each night of the Leonids shower. The natural light from the moon can obstruct your view so that smaller meteors are undetectable and even bigger ones appear dim. Try to choose a night during the shower that the moon is in the new moon phase, or as close as possible.A full moon is the worst time to try and watch the Leonids meteor shower.; , The shower usually peaks around November 17th. Consult an astronomy website or news source to confirm the peak date for this year. Assuming that the moon isn’t full or nearly full on this night, it will be the best time to watch the shower.The next major Leonids outburst is scheduled for 2033. These outbursts are when the show is most impressive to watch., From midnight to dawn are the best hours to watch the Leonids meteor shower. During these hours, the sky is at its darkest. This makes it easier to see the meteors because there is less light interference., Try to get out and away from cities. You want to find a place with as little light as possible and a good view of the sky. Keep your eye turned to the darkest part of the sky, and avoid looking at any lights (including a cell phone). You should also give your eyes fifteen minutes or more to adjust to the low light.You could watch the shower from a mountain top or a clearing in the forest with a good view of the sky.	Research the moon phases. Find out the peak night for the shower. Choose the darkest hours. Pick a dark location.

This includes a rotary cutter, acrylic rulers, and a cutting mat. These tools are made for precise cutting. Quilter's worldwide wouldn't think of starting a quilting project without them. You’ll find that the more accurately you cut your quilt pieces, the more accurately your quilt top is sewn together. Olfa is an excellent brand, and is the leader in the quilting community.; , You can't start a quilting project without one. Now, you can buy the really expensive Rowenta professional iron, or, you can go to Walmart or Target and buy their $20 steam iron. Both will get the job done. They both last about the same amount of time, will both do a decent job, but one is a lot less expensive to replace. It is highly recommended to use spring water in your irons—tap water can lead to hard water stains on your quilt top, and most manufactures say that you shouldn’t use distilled water.  Most quilters have two or three of them on hand at any given time. Dritz makes a variety of excellent seam rippers. You’ll find they have everything from seam rippers with magnifying glasses to ergonomic seam rippers for those of us quilters who rip out stitches on a regular basis.  These scissors and shears are spring loaded to prevent hand fatigue while cutting repetitively. Quilting, and sewing for that matter, involves a lot of cutting. blunt tipped work really well for cutting threads, and a pair of sharp tip, which are good to use for cutting appliqué pieces. Most quilters own these. Fiskars, in this instance, is my brand of choice.  A quarter inch foot for your sewing machine will get you going toward an accurate ¼ inch seam allowance. Almost all quilt patterns instruct you to use an accurate quarter inch. Many sewing machines come with these feet. However, if you bought a simple hobby machine, you’ll most likely need to purchase one. There are so many brands for different types of machines that you’ll want to check with your local machine dealership to buy the right one. Don’t worry, they aren’t expensive, but they’re definitely necessary. You may even find them at your local quilt shop.	Select quality rotary cutting supplies. Get a decent steam iron. Find a good seam ripper. Invest in spring loaded scissors and shears. Have a ¼ inch foot.
If you're trying to identify a song simply using a melody, it is first important to consider how much of that melody you actually remember. Every little bit of information helps, and will increase the likelihood that a friend will be able to pinpoint the song for you.   Being a more attentive listener throughout your music-listening habits will make future scenarios like this much easier to grapple with.Take care to make sure that all of the information you think you remember is actually right. The memory can be a strange thing, and a few botched notes in your melody can lead your helper completely astray.  If you distinctly remember the song's melody chances are you'll know the genre as well. Many people prefer certain genres over others, and the ones that tend to listen to the genre of the song in question will subsequently have the highest chance of successfully helping you out.   Enlisting the help of friends with formal musical training is helpful too, as they are used to identifying music purely on the basis of melody.  Sit down with your friend and recreate the melody for them, whether with your voice or the piano. Take care to accurately reproduce the cadence and rhythm of the melody as well-- melody entails far more than a simple sequence of notes!   While you can technically recreate the melody on just about any musical instrument, it's actually recommended you try doing it with your voice. Especially if you're not a trained musician yourself, the human voice offers a lot of potential for expression. In singing the melody, you might be able to get some of the timbre and tone across as well, making your approximation that much more specific.  Part of what you're doing is trying to give them an accurate impression inside their head as to the song. That way, they'll have an easier time to pinpointing it.   Many melodies can be used by multiple songs, so providing a little bit of context can go a long way towards helping identifying the song in question.  Encourage them to ask you questions about the song. It is possible you still remember more than the information you've offered them. Give another hum to the melody once the two of you have discussed it a little bit, and see if either of you approach it any differently.   While you're talking and humming the melody, you should remain open to the possibility that you'll remember the song yourself, provided it's something you've forgotten as opposed to trying to identify it from scratch.  If the first person you ask isn't successful, you should try getting help from other people. In the case of identifying a melody, in most cases it's a simple matter of having it click instantly. What ends up leading to the brainstorming stage for some people may be an instant bid for others. Don't lose hope if you can't get it right the first time; find someone new, and begin the process again.	Consider what you know of the song. Find a friend who might know the song.Choosing the right person to help you has a lot to do with what you currently remember of the song itself. Play or sing the melody.Find somewhere non-distracting and relatively quiet; that way, there won't be uncontrolled factors hindering the process. Describe the other parts of the music you remember.Giving your helper some context as to the tone, rhythm and general style of the song can help them pinpoint a song just as well as any melody. Brainstorm.Now that you've given them the melody, you and your friend can brainstorm as to what it's about. Ask others.
Repeat for each seed you're preparing to plant.; , Keep submerged for twelve hours.  Plant each seed in the container. Plant the seeds deep in seed-starting mixture.  Expect the seeds to take anywhere from 3 weeks to 3 months to germinate. Place the cotyledons in a water-based container for faster germination (this can speed up the germination process to between ten to twelve days).  When they are strong enough, separate and plant them in separate containers or in the garden. Expect fruit in about seven to twelve years; this is a slow process. Refer to the following section for growing the tree itself.  On the other hand, seedlings will take seven to twelve years before they can bear fruit.  Opt for a protected location that has full sun with sandy soil. (See "Tips" below for soil hints.)  , Blend ten pounds of composted manure into the soil.  When planting, ensure that its graft union is not over one or two inches higher than the bottom. , Increase the amount of manure it receives little by little, until the fully grown tree is being given around one hundred pounds per year.  It will produce its four-petal red or often yellow flowers in late winter or early spring. This will be followed by its apple-sized yellow or red fruit four or five months later, in mid-summer. Expect those fruits to fall after they are have ripened, at which point you can harvest them and enjoy their nutritional benefits.	Peel the coat off the 2-inch seed to reveal its white cotyledon. Immerse the cotyledons in a mixture of 550 ppm (parts per million) gibberellin (plant growth hormones) and water. Choose a planting container that is large enough to hold the seeds. Keep the seed-raising mix damp and warm. Keep the seedlings watered, mulched and fertilised once they take hold. Purchase a grafted tree rather than beginning one from seed if you have the opportunity, as grafted trees can flower in three to four years. Select the gardening site. Dig a hole sufficiently deep for taking the tree's roots. Plant the Cambogia tree thirty feet from the other trees. Water it well.  , Feed the tree another ten pounds of composted manure later within the year of planting. Know the fruiting cycle of your Cambogia.
If you want to make different colors, divide the flour up into separate bowls. How many bowls you use will depend on how many colors you want. The best part about using flour and baby oil is that it stays nice and light, clean-looking, and a little less like sand (and the kids might just believe that it's from the moon).  It is a lot easier to mix dry materials with other dry materials than with wet. If you plan on adding any color, glitter, or scents, do so now. Be sure to mix it into your flour well. Here are some powders that you can add to your flour right now:Add a tablespoon or two of powdered tempera paint, powdered water color, or powdered chalk if you just want to add color. If you are using an oil-based food dye, hold off for now.Add some powdered drink mix, such as Kool-Aid to give your moon sand a color and a nice smell. Add in a few teaspoons or tablespoons of glitter to give your sand some extra powder. Add in a sprinkle of spices, such as pumpkin pie, apple pie, vanilla sugar, cocoa, or cinnamon if you want to give your moon sand a nice smell.  If you don't have any powdered paint or spices, you can still color and scent your sand by adding stuff to it. Here are a few suggestions:To color your moon sand without powdered paint, try using oil-based food coloring or oil-based candy coloring. To scent your moon sand without spices, add a few drops of essential oil or baking extract (like vanilla or strawberry).  Once your color is mixed in (or not, if you want a blank slate), add in 1 1/4 cups of baby oil. It'll probably be easiest to just mix it up with your hands, though you'll get a bit dirty. Or you could just let the kids do this step!  , Once everything is in—color, scent, glitter and all—mix it all up thoroughly and get to playing with it. What'll be your first creation? A giant octopus? A castle? The moon itself?   If you're dealing with small children, just make sure they don't get any in their mouths. Baby oil and flour isn't dangerous, but paint or chalk added into the mix won't be any fun.  Moon sand does keep for a solid month or two, but you'll probably find that you want to make more anyway before the first batch gets old. But until then, store this batch in an air-tight container in a cool, dry place, like your pantry or in a child's toy box.   When you go to pull it back out for playtime round two, revive it with a couple tablespoons of water. It will come back to life and be just as good as new.	Pour the flour into a large bowl. Add any powder-based colors, scents, or glitter to the flour. Add any oil-based scents and colors to the baby oil and stir well.Water and oil do not mix, so regular food coloring or liquid water colors will not work. Add the baby oil to the flour. Mix it up and play with it. Store in an air-tight container.
You can buy shelves from your local bike shop or online. They range from $20 to hundred of dollars.   If you want to easily store items like bike tools, panniers and cleaning cloths along with your bike, buy a shelf with extra hooks or cubes.       If you want to display your bike inside your home like a piece of wall art, get a decorative shelf that is beautiful as well as sturdy.	Instead of purchasing a standard hook or bike rack, consider a bicycle shelf for your storage needs. Determine which type of shelf you need based on several factors.
When you see the first green shoots poke through, move the seedlings to a sunny area. Make sure the room temperature is above 70 degrees, but provide a bright space so they can grow strong and healthy.  If you covered your seedlings with a sheet of plastic wrap or newspaper, remove it and keep the seedlings moist with a couple of waterings a day. Water in the morning and early afternoon, but avoid watering later in the day. If water sits on the growing medium all night long it might facilitate the growth of mold.  Since the growing medium doesn't contain nutrients, you'll need to fertilize the seedlings with plant food after they've gotten a few inches tall. Find out what type of plant food is appropriate for the seedlings you're growing. Use organic fertilizer if at all possible.  If a lot of the seeds germinate and sprout, it's necessary to thin out some of the weaker seedlings so the strong ones can get even stronger. Thin them out to the point where you have 2 or 3 sprouts per seed container, or 2 or 3 sprouts for each area the size of one egg carton segment. Pick the extra sprouts out close to the base, pull out the roots and discard them.  When the growing season begins it will be time to move the seedlings to bigger containers or your outdoor garden. Make sure you get the right type of soil for your plants, and plant them in an area with the correct amount of sunlight and drainage.	Move the seedlings to a sunny place. Keep the seedlings moist. Feed the seedlings after a few weeks. Thin the seedlings. Transplant the seedlings when it's time.
To make a stele out of a pencil, you'll need: a pencil, a hot glue gun, hot glue sticks, a sharp tool like an X-Acto knife or a dotting tool, paint and a paint brush and a makeup sponge.   Make sure to get silver paint for the base coat of your stele. If you want other decorations, choose the colors that work for the design you had in mind. You should be able to get most of your supplies at a local craft store.; , First, you'll need to remove the eraser as you'll eventually be adding a tip to the eraser end of the pencil using glue and paint. You should be able to remove the eraser simply by using your fingers. However, if it's on particularly tight you can use a pair of pliers. Slide the pliers between the metal casing of the eraser and gently wiggle them until the casing falls off., To make a stele shadowhunter, you need to create a casing of glue around your pencil. This will be painted over in silver later to create the look of a stele. To do this, load a stick into your hot glue gun.   You'll want to do this over either paper towels or newspaper, as hot glue tends to get everywhere. Starting at the eraser end of the pencil, apply hot glue in rings around the pencil. After thirty seconds to a minute, the glue that you've already applied will be cool enough to touch. Test it by touching it with your finger. If it's not too hot, rub the pencil between your hands to spread the glue down the pencil.Keep rubbing the pencil between your hands. This will allow the glue to spread down the pencil, covering it an even casing. Apply extra glue as needed. Keep going until your pencil is covered in an even casing for glue. As you apply glue, there will be thin strains of glue that hang from the glue gun to the pencil. If you want, you can tear these off the glue gun and wrap them around the pencil with a finger. This will add some interesting texture to your stele.  How smooth you make the base layer of the stele is up to you. If you want it to have a lot of bumpy uneven texture, you can leave it as is. Or you can roll it along your fingers and between your palms to smooth out the hot glue. Smooth out the glue while it's still slightly warm and wet. Dry glue may be hard to smooth out., On the eraser end of the pencil, add a few more dabs of hot glue. Then, smooth it out the base to form a cylindrical top to the eraser end. The idea here is to make the base end thicker than the rest. You want to give the stele a wand-like appearance. It can help to look up images of shadowhunter steles and try to manipulate the glue to mimic their basic shape., Many shadowhunter steles have a snake-like design winding up their side. This is one of the easiest designs to create on a pencil stele. Simply place the tip of the glue gun on the eraser end and slowly draw a line spiraling around the pencil until you reach the tip.Keep in mind shadowhunter steles come in different shapes. If you feel more proficient at the glue gun, you can try to draw pictures of symbols using the glue gun. However, if you've never used a glue gun before it might be best to stick to the basic serpent design for your first try.  Use your X-Acto knife, a sharpened pencil, or some other small sharp object, work on the base of your stele. The easiest design is to carve out a small circle at the eraser tip, creating a kind of dot in the center of the tip. If you feel comfortable, consider adding your own unique design., You can use either acrylic paint or nail polish to paint the stele. Start with a silver paint. Use your brush, or a makeup sponge. Dip it in some silver paint and cover the whole stele in silver. If you want, you can stop here. However, you can add other colors or designs depending on the type of stele you're trying to emulate. For example, you can color the serpent-like design green and add markings like a snake. It's up to you and what you want your stele to look like.Leave the graphite tip unpainted if you want to use it as a pencil.	Gather the materials. Remove the eraser. Apply hot glue. Smooth out the glue. Form a base out of hot glue. Add hot glue to create a snake design. Add details to the eraser end using a sharp tool. Paint the stele.
If you use your toilet brush for a few seconds every day, you can pick up excess water. This will make it less likely that hard water spots will form and save you the trouble of an intensive clean., Bleach can be a good disinfectant. But it will cause rust stains to set, making it more difficult to remove some hard water spots. It can also be dangerous when mixed with other toilet bowl cleaners., Older toilet bowl cleaners had metal bristles. These could scratch up the insides of a toilet. This is counterproductive, because once a toilet bowl is scratched, it is easier for dirt to get into the scratches and next to impossible to get it out., When you flush with the bowl open it is possible for water to escape, getting some all over the toilet. This is unsanitary and increases the risk of hard water marks forming., If given the time, these stains will only settle in and become more difficult to remove. If you see stains appearing that can’t be removed with a simple scrubbing, immediately use either vinegar or heavy cleaning solutions to pick them up.	Brush daily. Be cautious with bleach. Avoid metal bristles. Close the bowl before you flush. Perform an intensive clean as soon as hard water marks appear.
You may need a ratchet wrench as well, depending on the vehicle requirements.   Access will be from the inside of the trunk or cargo area on an SUV or typical car. You need to pull away or unscrew the cover from around the back of the broken taillight/turn-signal cover to gain access. This exposes the bulb connections at the back of the taillight. Grip firmly at the back of the bulb and push it in. Twist counter-clockwise to remove it from the broken taillight/turn-signal cover. You will either need to unscrew the broken taillight/turn-signal cover from the outside or unbolt (or unscrew) it from the inside of the cargo area or trunk, depending on how the taillight/turn-signal cover is held in place. , Check to see if the taillight/turn-signal cover is working once it is reinstalled.  Those made prior to 1960 could have a separate taillight and turn-signal cover. However, the tools are the same.   You will find a screw holding the taillight in place on the back of the bed on some small trucks. Unscrew and remove the taillight/turn-signal cover from the bed. You will have exposed wires in the bulb holder once you have pulled the taillight/turn-signal cover from the bed. There may be more than one bulb holder. Disconnect the bulb holder by gripping it firmly at the back and pushing in. Twist counter-clockwise and remove the bulbs from the broken taillight/turn-signal cover. Reverse the process and install the new taillight/turn-signal cover and check to see that it is working properly.  Other than that, it is the same procedure as above.   Reverse the process as noted above and install the new taillight/turn-signal cover and check to see that it is working properly.	Use a screwdriver and, possibly, a set of open-end wrenches or sockets. Pull the lens away from the body of the vehicle.  , Reverse the procedure. Understand that the procedure for replacing a broken taillight/turn-signal cover will be a little different for a small truck or pickup, depending on the age. Unscrew the cover from inside the bed, exposing the back of the taillight/turn-signal cover to unbolt the broken taillight for removal on some newer trucks.
For soldering electrical components into printed circuit boards, the best soldering irons are Electrostatic Discharge (ESD) safe, temperature-controlled, high-power irons. These will let you solder for hours, and are good for complex amateur radio projects. For simple kits, an inexpensive pencil iron will do just fine.   Use a fixed power soldering iron, 25W for small jobs, and 100W for larger jobs with heavy cabling. If possible, variable temperature irons are available, which will make for the safest treatment of the boards. The tip temperature can be controlled to suit the size of the job.; , The most common solder alloy used in electronics is 60% tin and 40% lead, sometimes notated as 60/40. This alloy is recommended if you are new to soldering, though it is somewhat hazardous, requiring proper ventilation, breathing protection, or a soldering iron with a vacuum attachment.   Various lead-free alloys are becoming popular recently. These require higher soldering temperatures and do not "wet" as well as Tin-Lead alloys. However they are safer and can be more effective. 96.5 % tin to 3.5% silver is the most successful and will produce a joint with less electrical resistance than any tin-lead alloy. Both lead and lead-free formulations are available online at places like solderdirect.com and in your local Radioshack or Home Depot store.  Flux is an additive in solder that facilitates the soldering process by removing and preventing oxidation and by improving the wetting characteristics of the liquid solder. There are different types of flux cores available for solder wire.   Rosin is most commonly used by hobbyists. After soldering, it leaves a brown, sticky residue which is non-corrosive and non-conductive, but can be cleaned if desired with isopropyl alcohol. There are different grades of Rosin flux, the most commonly used is "RMA" (Rosin Mildly Activated). No-clean flux leaves a clear residue after soldering, which is non-corrosive and non-conductive. This flux is designed to be left on the solder joint and surrounding areas. Water-soluble flux usually has a higher activity that leaves a residue which must be cleaned with water. The residue is corrosive and may also damage the board or components if not cleaned correctly after use.  Mostly, electrical soldering deals with "through-hole" components, which are pressed into printed circuit boards (PCBs). Through-hole components have leads (wires or tabs) that pass through a hole in the board and are soldered to the pad of metal plating around the hole. The hole may be "plated through" or not.   Soldering other electrical items such as wires or lugs, have slightly different techniques, but the general principles of operating the solder and iron are the same.  Electrical components are usually quite small, and you'll need tongs, needle-nosed pliers, or tweezers to hold them in place while you operate the soldering iron and negotiate the solder. It can be a balancing act.   Some kind of clamp or stand is usually best to hold the board in place while you solder the components.  Select the correct component by checking it's type and value carefully. With resistors, check their color code. Bend leads correctly, if necessary, being careful not to exceed the stress specs, and clinch leads to fit the board.  Always solder in a well-ventilated area, using breathing and eye protection. Make sure to prop up the iron when it is on but not in use. Irons can start fires quite easily by burning into your workbench.   Seven to twelve inches of space should be between the electronic components and your face, or it may jump into your eyes. Solder may splatter.  Melt a small blob of solder on end of the soldering iron. This process is called tinning and it helps to improve heat flow from the iron to the lead and pad, keeping the board safe from the heat.          Carefully place the tip (with the blob) onto the interface of the lead and pad. The tip or blob must touch both the lead and the pad. The tip of the soldering iron should not be touching the nonmetallic pad area of the PCB, or any of the fibreglass area surrounding. This area can be damaged by excessive heat.  Flux from the solder wire is only active for about one second maximum after melting onto the joint as it is slowly burned off by heat. The lead and pad should be heated enough for the solder to melt not the connection point. The molten solder should "cling" to the pad and lead together by way of surface tension. This is commonly referred to as wetting.          If the solder does not melt onto the area, the most likely cause is insufficient heat has been transferred to it, or the surface needs to be cleaned of grease or dirt.  No more than a drop or two of solder should be necessary for each joint, though it will vary slightly for different components. The correct amount of solder is determined by:          On plated-PCBs, you should stop feeding when a solid concave fillet can be seen around the joint. On non-plated PCBs, you want to stop feeding when the solder forms a flat fillet. Too much solder will form a bulbous joint with a convex shape, while too little solder will form a concave joint.  Unfortunately, it's quite easy to damage a component or the board with too much heat. For the most part, however, you can keep the components and the board safe by moving swiftly. Keep a finger on the board nearby to ensure that it doesn't get too hot.   Try to err on the side of irons that are slightly less powerful than you think you might need. Use a 30 watt iron and practice soldering quickly so as to avoid excessive heating. If working with a double-sided circuit board check both sides for good solder joints. A good joint will look shiny and cone shaped. if it looks frosty and dull then it is a cold joint.  Some components (diodes, transistors, etc.) are quite susceptible to heat damage and require a small aluminum heat-sink clipped on to their leads on the opposite side of the PCB. Small aluminum heat sinks can be purchased through electronics supply houses. Hemostats (small) can also be used.  After a proper application of solder, the solder will be shiny and not dull. Visible indications are the best way to know if your solder joint is good. The solder needs to melt with the surface of the electronic components, rather than the tip of the soldering iron. This way, when the solder cools, it forms an alloy with the surface of the metal.   The solder joint should coat the surface of the component evenly, not too much such that it forms a glob, nor too little such that it does not completely coat the surface.  Burnt flux, rosin from the core of the solder, or plastic sheaths from wires may all burn onto the soldering iron. Such contaminants prevent the formation of a clean alloy between the electronic components. This is undesirable, because it raises the electrical resistance and also reduces the mechanical strength of the solder joint. A clean tip is shiny all the way around, without burnt gunk on it.   Clean the iron in between each component that you solder. Use a damp sponge or steel wool to clean it thoroughly. Tip thinner may also be used.  This cooling should only take five to ten seconds. If the components are too hot to handle, use needle nose pliers, or a tool called helping hands which consists of two alligator clips attached to a little articulated stand. If you watch carefully, the cooling solder will settle right before your eyes.  It's important to practice on throwaway stuff before you move straight to trying to solder something important. Gather some old junk boars and burnt out components from a junked radio or other electronic device to practice on.   Nobody is perfect, not even the professionals. Don't be ashamed to repeat a bit of soldering work. It will save you time in troubleshooting later.	Use a soldering iron with the appropriate heat control. Use solder wire of an appropriate alloy. Try to get flux-cored wire if possible. Get the necessary board and components. Get a clamp to hold the components. Prepare the components for soldering. Be extremely careful and solder in an appropriate location. "Tin" the solder. Feed the solder onto the interface between the pad and lead. Stop feeding the solder interface is filled. Move quickly. Consider using heat sinks for sensitive components. Learn to recognize when there is enough solder present. Keep the soldering iron clean. Make sure to let the solder cool completely before moving the components. Practice on junk components.
FUNimation, Viz Media, and Sentai Filmworks always put age ratings on their releases. Also, if you live in the UK the 'BBFC requires everything have an age rating on it, so there's no need to worry about unrated anime.; , Even shows airing in Japan currently have age ratings submitted by people who have watched the show and gave the rating from their best judgement.  See what other people have to say about the show. Sometimes the description can be a bit "blurry", but there's clearly going to be an age rating difference between a show that says "Hamtaro and his friends have fun adventures all around town!" and another one that says "In a post-apocalyptic world, a man (stalker) chases after attractive girls."  , Every parent has different standards as for what is appropriate, so you may want to watch shows you're iffy about before you allow your kids to watch them.

Aluminum foil is a good scrubber for a hot glue gun. Rip of a square of a aluminum foil and wad it up in a ball. A big piece is a necessity because it will help keep you from burning your fingers., With the glue gun warm, push the tip into the ball of foil, making sure you don't burn your fingers by touching the tip. Rotate the tip or the ball to scrub it, taking off glue and other debris., Once you're done with the tip, rub the rest of the gun down with the foil. The gun should be warm so that the glue is easy to remove. It should scrape off most of the glue., Set the glue gun on its side, preferably on a silicone mat. Lay a single piece of foil on top of the glue. Rub the foil in, using protection on your hands so you don't burn your fingers. Go over it with the heat gun or blow dryer. The glue should stick more to the aluminum foil than the glue gun, so you can easily peel it off. Repeat the process as needed.You may need to remove parts, like the kickstand, to help clean the whole gun.	Tear off a large piece of aluminum foil. Scrub the tip with the foil ball. Rub the glue gun down with the aluminum foil. Heat the glue gun using a heat gun or blow dryer.
A miter saw can be used for PVC projects that require many specific, detailed cuts. Use a tooth-count saw appropriate to the cutting job and the saws available. When in doubt, go with something like a standard 10 Tooth per-inch (TPI) wood blade, which comes with most miter saws. It'll depend on the particular brand and style of saw that you've got, though.  Miter boxes are the easiest things in the world to use, since you've got the cut-lines pre marked alongside the box for you. You won't be able to miss.  Start the blade and bring it down at a fairly slow to medium speed. Once cut, the process can be repeated with ease, making additional cuts in the pipe as necessary.	Consider using a miter box and saw for more specific cuts. Place the PVC pipe under the blade where you need your cut. Secure the pipe with a work clamp.
To prevent the spread of disease through contact with the plant or soil, throw them away immediately with your regular trash before doing any more work in the area. Further prevent the disease from spreading by disinfecting your tool immediately after pruning each leaf. Have a solution of 1-part bleach to 4-parts water within easy reach..; , Prune the infected leaves, including those that have turned yellow or are about to, since these are most likely too far gone to recover. If the infection is widespread, it’s better to prune off entire limbs rather than just removing leaves. Treat what remains, including the leaves’ bottoms as well as their tops.Although there is no guaranteed cure for black spot disease,try the following remedies, which can slow and prevent the disease from spreading, and use whichever shows the best results:   Mix together a solution of 1 tbsp. baking soda, 2.5 tbsp. vegetable oil, 1 tsp. liquid soap, and 1 gallon water. Be sure to use liquid soap, not detergent. Since this may potentially burn your leaves, spray a small test area with the solution before spraying the entire plant. If burning is absent or minimal, spray the leaves once every two weeks.Combine 1-part dairy milk to 2-parts water. Spray the leaves once each week. (Sorry, vegans; non-dairy milk substitutes won’t work).Spray the leaves with neem oil once every two weeks.Use fungicides as a last resort if the disease returns for multiple growing seasons.Follow their directions regarding applications. Apply them early, before outbreaks or at the first sign of spots, since they are preventative in nature. Choose organic products if possible for both the plant’s health as well as pollinating insects., Remove them from the area as soon as you prune them. Put them with your regular garbage, preferably in a tied bag. If you dump them straight into a trashcan, secure the lid firmly to prevent the wind or animals from blowing or tracking them free.   Do not add infected leaves to compost, since the disease may survive and infect other plants when that compost is used as mulch.	Prune infected leaves immediately.Ensure the overall health of your plant by removing diseased leaves entirely. Treat infected areas. Throw away infected leaves.
The weights are typically listed as bulky, worsted, sport, etc. Most yarns will have this written on the label, but sometimes they might have a number that correlates to the weight instead. For example:0: Lace 1: Superfine or Fingering 2: Fine or Sport 3: Light or DK; , You can find this near the top of the pattern, often just below the yarn and hook recommendations. It will tell you how many rows and stitches there should be within a set of inches/centimeters. It will typically be written as:   Gauge: # stitches and # rows = 4 inches ( 10.16 centimeters) # stitches and # rows in single crochet = 4 inches ( 10.16 centimeters)  , Making your square larger will help make measuring more accurate later on.For example, if the pattern calls for a 4 by 4-inch ( 10.16 centimeters) gauge swatch, your starter chain should be 5 to 6 inches (12.7 to 15.24 centimeters).  In most cases, this will be the single crochet stitch, often written as "scs." If the pattern calls for something different, such as double crochet, then you should use that instead.   Again, make sure that your square is a little bit larger than what the pattern recommends.  Some crochet patterns recommend that you steam or block the finished piece. You should treat the gauge piece the same way as you would the finished work. If the pattern says to steam of block the finished project, then you should do the same to the gauge piece.A simple way to block is to place a towel over your swatch, and then iron it using lots of steam. Remove the towel and let the piece cool before moving on., Make sure that you can see your stitches and rows clearly. Also, make sure that the swatch lays smoothly; there should be no bumps or ripples.  Make sure that the square inside your swatch is the same size as the gauge. For example, if the gauge is 4 by 4 inches ( 10.16 centimeters), then your square should be 4 by 4 inches (10.16 centimeters). You will count your stitches within this square.  If your stitches are very small, you might find it easier to count them with a pencil or knitting needle. This way, you won't accidentally count two small stitches as one stitch.   Consider writing down the number of stitches and rows on a scrap of paper.  In order for the gauge to be correct, the number of stitches and rows within that square must match up to the pattern's gauge.If you have too many or too few stitches/rows, then you will need to make some adjustments, and make another square.  Sometimes, the gauge will be off, even with the correct hook size. This is usually due to working too tightly or too loosely. A quick fix is to simply use a different sized hook. Keep making swatches and changing hook sizes until your gauge matches up with the pattern's.If your swatch has too many stitches and rows, you are crocheting too tightly. Go up a hook size. If your swatch has not enough stitches and rows, you are crocheting too loosely. Go down a hook size.  If you are crocheting too tightly, then avoid tugging as much. This will help loosen your stitches. If you are crocheting too loosely, then work tighter by giving the yarn a slight tug after each stitch.  Some yarns are just thinner than others, despite being the same weight. Other yarns are easier to work with, or "stretch" better. Try to use a yarn that is similar to the one in the pattern., Keep making adjustments and squares until your gauge matches the pattern's gauge.	Read the project instructions and select the correct yarn weight and hook size.Some instructions will specify a brand name and material for the yarn, but you can choose something else as long as it's the same weight. Find the gauge information on the pattern. Make a foundation chain about an inch or so longer than the recommended gauge swatch. Crochet a square using the pattern's recommended stitch.The pattern will tell you what stitch to use for the gauge. Block the square, if necessary. Lay your swatch down on a flat surface in a well lit area. Mark out a square on your swatch using sewing pins and a tape measure. Count the number of stitches and rows in your swatch. Compare them to the pattern. Change the hook size if the gauge is off. Try making your stitches a little looser if you can't get another hook. Try a different yarn. Create another square and measure again.
If you draw the pattern on a piece of paper or tissue paper, this will allow you to insert it inside the glass, secure it, and use the pattern to transfer and paint over the design. Tissue paper will be easier to work with as it bends much more easily.   You by no means need to create a design that requires a sketch. Geometrical and abstract patterns are just as beautiful, if not more so. If it'd be helpful, use tape to devise a pattern on the outside of your glass; you can then easily paint around it. Same goes for the stem and base!  , There are so many products out there, it's tough to know where to get started. The simplest way is to sketch your design and secure it with tape on the inside of your glass. You have a couple more options, however:   Place your sketch inside your glass and fill it with something like a sock or quilt batting. The soft interior will keep it in place, intact. Buy self-adhering stencils at your local craft supply store. If you can fathom its existence, it can be found. Stencils come in sticker form nowadays, and you can just plop them onto your glass and paint away.  Use a fine point sharpie (or marker that will not wipe off) to sketch a design on the glass. If you don't like your sketch, you can use a q-tip or cotton ball dipped in rubbing alcohol or nail polish remover to "erase" the marker or paint.   This outline will probably remain visible. If you want to go for a more of a "One Stroke" method, skip sketching directly on the glass, and just paint using the sketch underneath.  As with stencils, it's easy to walk into the paint aisle and feel absolutely overwhelmed. There are a handful of varieties to choose from and the differences are really only nuanced -- they'll all create something pleasurable to the eye. What you choose is just a matter of current mood and taste.   Enamels (like Folk Art or Martha Stewart) are water-based and especially geared toward glass painting.They can handle the dishwasher if cured (not necessarily the microwave, however) -- but some require a primer and top coat (like PermEnamel), so note the label.Acrylics work, too. However, it generally depends on the quality of the paints you choose -- some are more prone to washing off. If you do go the acrylic route, spray a high-quality varnish on top (they have sparkly ones!) to secure the paint to the glass.There are acrylics that are designed more for glass painting. If acrylic is your jam, use this variety.   Regardless of what type of paint you end up using, you'll probably encounter air dry and heat dry forms. In general, the glasses that are baked (require heat drying) last longer.To add more spice to the mix, you'll also have the option of choosing transparent (light will pass through), opaque (light will not pass through), and frosted paints. Decisions, decisions. They've officially thought of everything -- glass paint markers are available, too. They bake on and make even the most detailed of glasses beginner-doable., Though it should go without saying, paint isn't fun to pick off your favorite sweater or your grandma's mahogany table. Go change your clothes, and lay down several layers of newspaper or wax paper -- anything to protect those surfaces. And take the dog outside.   While you're at it, open the windows. Being high on paint fumes isn't the state you want to be in for this project!  , Glass painting methods number no fewer than canvas painting methods. This part is entirely up to you. But if you're looking for a little inspiration, here's a few jumping off points:   Create a marbleized glass by pouring your paint over your piece, top to bottom. Pour in a thin even layer, rotating the glass consistently. Alternate colors as desired. Liquid fill paints will be best for this method.Use just one color and pour on until completely covered to create a solid painted glass.   Use tape to make stripes. Just after you've painted between the stripes, take it off; if the tape is taken off when the paint is dry, you risk chipping the paint. If you have any quirks in your stripes, just take your craft knife and carefully chip away until the lines are straight. Get polka-dotting. The blunt end of your paintbrush is great for dots, or you can use a dauber or spouncer. To do this effectively, never come in or go out at an angle. Always place your tool straight down and take it straight back up. Use sponges. Whether it's a dish sponge or a sponge brush, you can create interesting, layered designs with a dab of paint -- little skill required. Add colors on top of each other to create shading and highlighting. That's just painting 101.  Don't forget the stem and base! Half of your "canvas" isn't the actual glass (if you're using a wine glass). For the base, consider painting the underside to achieve an is-it-there-is-it-not-there look. You know the kind.  If you were wondering about paintbrushes, unless you're an avid painter, they're all pretty much the same. But if we're splitting hairs, the synthetic ones will be more stroke-y; natural-haired brushes will paint a smooth, complete picture., Resin-based paints are incredibly temporary until baked and can even be removed with warm water.If you absolutely must remove the paint, do so quickly.	Sketch your design first on a piece of paper. Secure your stencil to the glass. Sketch the design onto the glass. Choose your paints. Prep the area. Start coloring. Remove paint with nail polish remover if corrections are needed.
Wrap a measuring tape around your head like a headband: under the back of your head, up the sides, and over the top of your head. Record your measurement, then subtract 4 inches (10.16 centimeters). This is your new measurementIf you don't have a measuring tape, you can use some ribbon or string instead, then use a ruler to subtract 4 inches (10.16 centimeters).; , Choose a wider ribbon—something around 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) wide would be ideal. The ribbon can be satin or grosgrain. Satin comes in more colors, but grosgrain comes in more patterns., Light a candle or ignite a lighter. Hold the cut end of the ribbon close to the flame for a few seconds, or until the cut edge melts. Repeat for the other side., The elastic should be narrower than your ribbon. Something between ½ and ¾-inch (1.27 and 1.91-centimeter) wide would be ideal. If the elastic is super stretchy, you may want to cut it a little shorter to make the headband tighter., Turn the ribbon so that the wrong side is facing you. Squeeze out a drop of hot glue on one end. Make sure that it's centered., The end of the elastic needs to overlap the end of the ribbon by ½ inch (1.27 centimeters). Make sure that the elastic is centered., Make a small drop of hot glue on the ribbon to the left of the elastic. Fold the edge down onto the elastic and press it into place. Repeat for the right side., Place another drop of hot glue on the other end of the ribbon. Press the elastic into place, then glue the side edges down. You do not need to glue the side edges down along the entire ribbon—over the elastic.	Measure your head, then subtract 4 inches (10.16 centimeters). Cut your ribbon according to your new measurement. Seal the ends of the ribbon with a flame. Cut 4 inches (10.16 centimeters) of elastic. Make a dot of hot glue on one end of the ribbon. Press one end of the elastic into it. Glue the side edges of the ribbon down onto the elastic. Repeat the process for the other side of the ribbon.
Breathing correctly is imperative to having a strong voice. The key is to breathe deeply:   As you inhale and exhale, try to inflate your stomach and kidney (back) areas with your breath. To ensure that you’re breathing into these areas, place your hands around your waist, with your thumbs on your back, your fingers at your front, and your palms resting on your sides down towards your hips. You should feel your hands expand and contract with each breath. Over time, as you strengthen your breath, these expansions and contractions will get bigger and longer. If you have trouble breathing deeply, try lying on the floor on your back, with your hands on your stomach. When you inhale, your hands should rise; when you exhale, your hands should lower.Note that your shoulders should not be moving up and down with your breath.; , When you’re breathing correctly, when you inhale, the lower muscles (diaphragm) over your abdomen should move outward, making room for more air. As you sing (or talk or just exhale), use those muscles to push the air back out.   Use the muscles over your lower back (around your kidneys) in exactly the same way to control your inhalations and exhalations.  Pay attention to the position of your feet, knees, hips, abdomen, chest, shoulders, arms, and head:Your feet should be slightly apart, with one foot slightly in front of the other so that your weight is slightly forward. Your knees should be relaxed and slightly bent. When aiming for good posture it can be tempting to lock your knees; be careful not to do this. Your hands should be relaxed and hanging at your sides. Your abdomen should be relaxed but ready to be engaged. To get a sense of how an engaged abdomen feels, place your hands on your waist (with your thumbs on your back) and cough very lightly. Your shoulders should slide back and down so that your back is straight and your head is high. Do not hunch or pull your shoulders up towards your ears. Your chest should be slightly up and out— this will likely happen naturally when you pull your shoulders back and down. Your chin should be parallel with the floor — neither lifted or pointed downward.  Once you’ve moved into the correct posture, check in to make sure that you are not holding tension anywhere. It should not feel as though you’re forcing your chest out or your back to be straight. Be sure to relax your face and your neck.   Singing or speaking while your body and face are tensed will only make it more difficult to produce a high-quality sound.  Your mouth should be wide open when you sing, but avoid the temptation to open it so wide that your face and neck muscles tense up. Check in to make sure that your lips, jaw, and neck feel loose and relaxed.  A common piece of advice from professional singers is to create space in your mouth. Opening your mouth wide is part of how you can do this; another part of creating space involves dropping your jaw and tongue, and lifting your soft palate (the ridged flesh at the roof of your mouth).   To do this, breathe in as you would before yawning, but try not to yawn. Pay attention to the space this creates in your mouth, including the open feeling at the back of your throat. You want to replicate this wide-mouthed, soft-jawed/lifted palate position when singing., When creating space in your mouth, make sure that your tongue is out of the way. Let it rest softly at the bottom of your mouth, with its tip touching the back of your lower teeth.   Try not to stick your tongue out or wave it around while you’re singing, as this will impair the quality of your voice, and could reduce the richness of your tone.  Too much saliva in your mouth might make it difficult to sing, so remember to swallow before starting!  , Before singing or doing more demanding vocal exercises, you’ll benefit from doing some of the following simple exercises to warm up your voice:Yawn. Yawning will help stretch and open your mouth and throat, and can help release tension in your neck and diaphragm. To trigger a yawn, try opening your mouth wide and breathing in.Cough very gently. Think of it as lightly pushing air out from the back of your throat in short bursts. This will help you engage your lower chest and abdominal muscles, which are the muscles you should use while singing (as opposed to your throat/upper chest).Do gentle lip rolls. Hold your lips lightly together and blow air out of them while humming. Focus on having a relaxed throat and an engaged core while you do this. Practise lip rolls going from a low to high note and vice versa. Once you’re used to the lip rolls, practise doing scales with them.To help your body learn to relax while you sing, tense up your body and then right after releasing the tension, do a lip roll from low to high; repeat, this time going high to low.Humming is another gentle way to warm up your voice. Try humming along with music on your way to school or work or, if you’d prefer not to do that sort of thing in public, hum while you cook or while you’re in the shower., Starting as low as you can comfortably sing, gently move up the scale using a “me” sound until you reach the highest note at which you are comfortable. Then, move down the scale from high to low using an “e” sound.Don’t push your range — be gentle with it, letting it increase over time. You can also do this with an “oo” sound.  Your mouth should look as though you’re sucking in a long string of spaghetti as you inhale. When you exhale, make a “woo” sound. It should sound buzzy, similar to the sound made by a kazoo. Keep the sound steady as you exhale; do this 2 to 3 times.Next, go up and down your scales using the “woo” sound.  Say groups of single words or entire phrases without stopping between the words — treat them as a single word. Lengthen the vowels and exaggerate the vocalization of each word as you say and/or sing it.As you speak/sing, imaging that you’re filling a room with your voice. Focus on smooth transitions: when switching between higher and lower, and louder and softer parts of a song, imagine moving up and down a ramp — not a staircase. Example words: moon moan mourn mane mean.Example phrases: many men munch many melons, A lot of vocal exercises can sound and look pretty funny. Relax and have fun with it. Two fun and silly exercises that help open up your throat:   Sing “meow” slowly, emphasizing its three sounds — mee, ahh, and ooo. Make weird faces by stretching out your tongue in all directions. You can do this while singing or even just making weird noises.  As with physical exercise, cooling down after doing vocal exercises is important. One way to cool down is to do the same simple vocal warm-ups you started with (for example, yawning, light coughing, rolling your lips, and humming).Another way to cool down is simply to gently glide up and down, and down and up, on the sound “m”, so that you feel a tickling vibration in your lip/nose area., Whether you're warming up, singing, or giving a speech, breathing deeply and keeping your body, throat, and face relaxed are key to ensuring a high-quality voice.  Drink at least six to eight 8-ounce glasses of water each day — more if you exercise or live somewhere hot (i.e. if you sweat a lot)., Whole grains, fruits, and vegetables promote a healthy voice by keeping the mucus membranes that line your throat healthy., These include smoke (even second-hand smoke), spicy foods, milk products, foods with a high-salt content (ex., bacon or salted nuts), citrus fruits, alcohol (including mouthwashes that contain alcohol), and cold and allergy medications., If you body is fatigued, it will show in your voice.Adults should aim for 7 to 9 hours of sleep each night; teenagers should aim for 8.5 to 9.5 hours each night.If you get at least 7.5 hours of sleep each night and do not wake up feeling refreshed, see your doctor to ensure that there are no underlying reasons for this., Stress affects everything negatively. Take time every day to do something that helps you relax. Relaxing activities include yoga, meditation, walking, watching a show you love, reading a good book, or playing an instrument.  This is particularly important if you have a performance coming up. Shouting can strain your voice and diminish its quality for even a few days after.  If the quality of your voice has recently diminished — for example, become raspy, deeper, or strained — it may be a sign that you are experiencing a health issue. To be on the safe side, see a doctor to rule out potential health issues., It could take some time to improve the quality of your voice. You won’t see enormous overnight results, but you likely will feel some difference almost immediately after combining proper breathing and posture with some simple warmups.   It’s okay to take it slow. Start with learning how to breathe more deeply and stand correctly. Once you’re comfortable with that, work on your mouth position and some simple warm-ups.  A good teacher can give you detailed feedback and advice on how to improve your voice. Aim for someone with classical training, as a classically trained teacher is likely to have experience with a variety of styles.If you can’t afford a voice coach, there are many online lessons available for free. Just type “singing lessons” or “voice coach” into YouTube, and you’ll have a wealth of videos to choose from.  Listen to the way they handle their breath, volume, articulation, control, vocal habits, and resonance. If you’re particularly fond of their style, see if you can replicate it.   Replicating someone’s style is a great way of learning to sing, because it forces you to try things you might not normally try when singing.  Pay attention to how they breathe and support the notes with their breath. Note their posture and body language. Watch the way they use their lips to shape the sounds and words that they are singing.  Think about why you dislike a certain singer or speaker. What do they do differently from the ones you like? Are they doing something wrong or is it just not your style?  , It is amazing what a good sound engineer can accomplish during a recording session. If you really like an artist's recordings, try to figure out how much is real and how much is engineered before you decide that "you can never sound as good as that!"  , Ask those whose voice you like what they are doing to get that sound. Most will be flattered and pleased to share this information with you.	Learn to breathe. Use your abs. Learn the correct posture. Relax. Have an open but relaxed mouth. Lift your soft palate. Ensure your tongue is positioned correctly. Remember to swallow. Warm up. Sing scales. Practise “woo” scales. Practise smooth projection with words and phrases. Be prepared to feel silly. Cool down. Remember to breathe and stay relaxed. Drink enough water. Eat for a healthy voice. Avoid substances that can irritate your vocal folds. Get enough sleep. Relax. Avoid shouting. Get help. Be patient. Find a good, professional teacher. Listen closely to professional singers and speakers. Watch professional singers and speakers. Don’t ignore professionals you dislike. Compare the way an artist sounds in a live performance to the way he or she sounds in a recording. Go to open mics and other local music events.
Tablature is a visual guide that will teach you how to play notes of songs if you don't know how to read music. Since many people don't know how to read music, tablature is becoming increasingly popular.  As boring as they sound, scales are actually very important in the development of serious musicians. Learning scales will help you practice your fingering, improve your speed and agility, as well as help you to solo/improvise.  A solo is when a musician sets off on their own and plays a musical passage that's distinct, varied, and sometimes improvised. Soloing can be hard, but it's also rewarding.  When you get to the point of starting to be bored playing other people's music, it may be time to create your own. Composing your own music takes a lot of time, practice, and false starts, but having your own song is like nothing else in the world.  Some of these techniques include sweep picking (with fingers or with a pick, it's harder with fingers), tapping, tremolo picking (again, harder with hands than with a pick) and slapping/popping.  If you are at this point, it means that you really like what you are doing. You may be bored with always tuning and detuning your bass, so having 2 or three can save you some time.	Start learning tablature. Begin to learn scales. Try your hand at soloing. Start composing your own songs. Learn some advanced techniques when you feel you are ready. When you feel the need of having two or more basses, go for it!
Vehicles equipped with an automatic transmission are designed not to start if the transmission is not in park or neutral. Starting a car while in drive could result in the vehicle lurching forward, causing damage or injuring someone. Check your shift lever to ensure it is completely in park or neutral, then attempt to turn the key again. Be sure the indicator on the shift lever is pointing at the “P” for park. Try taking the vehicle out of park and putting it back in if you can, then turn the key again.; , If your key won’t turn when you insert it into the ignition, it may be because the key has been damaged and no longer engages the correct pins to the depth necessary to spin the cylinder. Examine the key for signs of excessive wear, rounding or broken teeth. Any of these could result in the key failing to turn in the ignition.If the key is damaged, it will have to be replaced. Some keys require programming from the dealership when replaced. Refer to your owner’s manual to check the requirements for your vehicle.  Just as worn or damaged teeth can prevent the key from turning, anything stuck to the key will also cause it to improperly engage the pins in the ignition cylinder. If you used your key to open a package recently, for instance, there may be bits of tape stuck to the teeth of the key, preventing it from working.Clean any debris or dirt off of the key, then re-insert it and try again. Do not use your keys to open packages or do anything else other than start your vehicle.  If you were applying any pressure to the steering wheel when you turned the car off, it may have locked the wheel in place with the steering pin. Check to see if your steering wheel is locked by trying to turn the wheel. If it will not move, or moves only very slightly, it is likely locked. A locked steering wheel will not allow the ignition to engage.When you move the wheel back and forth, you will feel it stop abruptly as it comes into contact with the steering wheel lock. If your wheel was turned slightly without you applying any pressure when you turned the car off, it still may engage the steering wheel lock.  In order to unlock the steering wheel, insert the key into the ignition and attempt to turn it. While applying light pressure to the key, wiggle the steering wheel back and forth until the lock disengages. This will allow the steering wheel and the key to turn.The key will be able to turn freely in the ignition once the steering wheel is unlocked. If the key still fails to turn after the wheel is unlocked, there is another issue.	Ensure the vehicle is in park. Inspect the key for damage. Ensure there is nothing stuck to the key. Check to see if the steering wheel is locked. Wiggle the wheel back and forth while turning the key.
Use a good houseplant potting medium, not garden soil. Repot it in a larger pot each spring or divide the old plant into several smaller ones and repot them in a fresh potting medium.; ,   Put your spider plant in an east, west or north windowsill any time of the year. Put the spider plant in a south window during the winter months or 12” (30.5 cm) away from a south window in late spring and summer. Provide bright fluorescent or other lighting and spider plants will do fine. Provide light shade to deep shade for spider plants that are used outside.    Use room temperature water. Use distilled or purified water, if possible. Let the pot surface feel dry to the touch before watering. Water until water drains from the bottom and empty drained water from trays promptly. ,,	Pot your spider plant correctly. Place your spider plant in the right light. Water the spider plant correctly. Fertilize spider plants once a month in the spring and summer with houseplant fertilizer mixed according to label directions.  , Keep spider plants between 40º and 85ºF (4.5º to 29.5ºC).  , Groom spider plants by trimming off dead leaf tips or leaves with scissors.
It will tell you if you have the option to pay the ticket online, or if you must appear in court.   Note the county in which you received the citation. A California Highway Patrol ticket is payable only to that county's court. Look out for correspondence from the county court by mail. Most counties will send you information about paying or contesting a traffic ticket. You will also be told if traffic school is an option.; , You must wait a few days for your citation number to be entered into the system, so wait at least 2 business days after you got the ticket, and at least 2 business days before it's due.   Be sure to pay by the due date. Most counties in California will not accept payment online if a traffic ticket is past due.  You will see a list of 58 counties. Click on the one where you were ticketed.   Each county has a different website, and a different way of handling online payments. A few counties, like Kings, for example, do not allow you to pay your traffic ticket online. However, most of these counties provide a number that you can call and pay your citation with a credit card.  In general, there will be a button that says "Pay a traffic ticket," or "Paying your traffic fine," or similar words.   Most have links to pay a ticket, request a court date and possibly request traffic school.  Enter your name, address, and driver's license number. Enter your citation number as listed on your ticket.  Most payments must be made by either credit card or electronic funds transfer.   If you choose to pay with a credit card, enter your credit card number, expiry date, security code, name and billing address, as required. If you choose to pay with an electronic funds transfer you will need to enter your bank routing number and account number as well as your name, address and bank. The routing number and account number are listed on the bottom left of most personal checks.  Check the box to plead guilty or no contest to the citation. You may also have an option to choose traffic school. Finalize the process using whatever button means "Submit," and look for a confirmation that your citation has been paid.   A no contest plea means that you will not admit to guilt but you will receive the same punishment as if you plead guilty. A no contest plea is often used to avoid admitting guilt in the case of future lawsuits.	Read the citation carefully. Schedule time. Go to the California Pay Traffic Fines page. Click the Pay... button. Fill out the online form. Choose the payment method. 'Fess up.
In the USA, pet food labeling is regulated on a federal (FDA) and state-by-state basis, with guidance from the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO). However, AAFCO provides only minimum requirements. The reality is that pet food producers often use terms that are undefined by the regulations, in order to communicate more effectively with consumers and improve their product's image in the market.  The AAFCO warns on their website that "it is not rare at all that labeling and marketing information is designed to appeal to the latest trend in marketing human products." In other words, the focus tends to be more on appealing to our preferences than on whether or not the food is suitable for your pet. For this reason, learn to look behind the marketing hype and to find the real substance of the nutrition status within the pet food.        It is important to always check the ingredient list because a named food is not always necessarily the primary ingredient.; , See the example under "Tips" below. Note that the percentages given for protein, fat, and fiber are measurements of the food in its current state. However, because different pet foods have different levels of moisture, you can only logically compare pet foods on a dry matter basis. Moisture levels in pet foods can range from approximately 6 percent to as much as 80 percent.  Canned food obviously contains more moisture than dry kibble. But it may not necessarily contain as much protein, for example. You can't tell which food contains the most protein, fat or fiber until you have converted both labels to a dry matter basis.       Determine the amount of dry matter first, by subtracting the percentage given for moisture from 100 percent. Using the example below, the moisture accounts for 10 percent of the pet food. Therefore, the dry matter content is (100% - 10% = ) 90% of the pet food. Convert the protein, fat and fiber percentages to a dry matter basis by dividing the percentages given on the label by the amount of dry matter (from the previous step). In our example, the 26 percent protein on the label converts to 28 percent on a dry matter basis by dividing 26% by 90%. (Notice that in this example the dry matter calculation is only slightly different than the labeled percentage. This is because the moisture level was only 10 percent per the label. If the moisture level had been, say, 40 percent, then the dry matter content would have only been 60 percent and protein on a dry matter basis would have been calculated as (26% divided by 60% =) 43%.) Compare the new protein level of 28 percent on a dry matter basis to other pet foods (once you've converted the other pet food labels in the same way). Do similar comparisons for fat and fiber after converting to a dry matter basis calculation.  You may have 28 percent protein on a dry matter basis, but what is the source of that protein? You can get protein from chicken beaks and feet that are not good sources of nutrition for your pet! This means that you'll need to look next at the list of ingredients. Pet foods must list ingredients in order of weight.  Generally, the first five ingredients will make up the majority of the pet food product. Ideally, look for meat as one of the first ingredients on a pet food label. Grains, such as corn, cornmeal, whole wheat, barley, rice are used to provide essential energy for the pet and appealing texture to the kibble.       Even the AAFCO website admits that "Economics plays a part in any ingredient selection" and "protein is not simply protein. Ingredients providing protein have specific amino acids which may or may not match the amino acid profile required by a cat or a dog." Manufacturers routinely combine multiple protein sources to provide for all the amino acids required for a healthy life.  For example, by breaking an ingredient down into components and then listing them individually so that you don't notice an easily recognized undesirable ingredient too near the top of the list, this information can be effectively changed enough to cause you to read the label differently.  However, some animal by-products like liver and other internal organs are excellent sources of the amino acids and other nutrients that dogs and cats need. In addition, dry pet foods need preservatives to prevent spoilage and degradation of essential nutrients.   Contact the manufacturer direct to find out what the "by-products" listed in their product actually consist of. Be aware that this may change without warning. Sometimes your pet's reaction will be enough to make this obvious!  , The density of dry products can be changed through puffing up the food, while different wet foods can be labeled with pounds or ounces (or other measurements), making weight comparison harder. Check the price comparison to get the real value.  This is one of the most important aspects of a pet food label because it can impact a pet's health if claims are made about being nutritionally complete when the product is not able to meet all nutrient requirements for your pet. To be reassured on this count, look for:   The words: "(Name of product) is formulated to meet the nutritional levels established by the AAFCO (Dog/Cat) Food Nutrient Profiles." Or look for the words: "Animal feeding tests using AAFCO procedures substantiate that (name of product) provides complete and balanced nutrition." Be sure to choose the right life cycle stage for your pet - this should be on the label too (for example, kitten/puppy). Pet food needed for pets that are growing, reproducing or working hard should be chosen with care that it can meet all the nutrient requirements for that pet. Size, breed or senior labeling claims must meet the criteria for adequate adult pet nutritional needs; in reality, the more precise claims are harder to ascertain.  Even if you think you know how to feed your pet the particular product, changes do happen or you might have transposed feeding instructions from one product to a new one. Always read these with care to ensure that you are feeding your pet adequately. However, even though manufacturers try to cover all contingencies, you still need to monitor your own pet's needs, preferences and environmental conditions. Talk to your vet if you're unsure, especially with respect to growing and reproducing pets.And don't forget to visit the vet every month or so to be sure..   As part of feeding, also read the calories provided by the product. The amount of calories provided can vary considerably between products and between dry and wet foods. If your pet is growing, overweight or underweight, or has an illness, calories are of especial interest. Calorie statements are made on a "kilocalories per kilogram" basis. Kilocalories are the same as the "Calories", while a "kilogram" is a unit of metric measurement equal to 2.2 pounds. It may also be stated as "per cup" or "per can", alongside the required kilocalories per kilogram statement.  These are marketing words without official definitions to back them up. While it is surely to be hoped that all pet food is "natural", this usually refers to a lack of artificial additives, colors or flavors. The words "premium" and "gourmet" and the like are marketing speak and don't mean anything more than what the overall packaging suggests to the consumer. Organic pet food should be free of synthetic additives but guidelines are still under development for the official meanings.	Learn to look beyond the marketing claims accompanying pet food. Locate the "Guaranteed Analysis" on the pet food label. Be aware that percentages alone don't tell the whole story. Be mindful that pet food manufacturers can manipulate this information. Some pet owners search for pet foods that use human grade ingredients with no animal by-products and avoid pet foods that use artificial colors, flavors, sugars and chemical preservatives (notably BHA and BHT). Do a cost per weight analysis to determine the weight value of the pet food product. Check the label for "nutritional adequacy". Read the feeding instructions. Be savvy about marketing claims such as natural, organic, premium, etc.
Direction of prevailing winds and/or seasonal cross-winds.       Drainage of area. Slight sloping (2% maximum grade) is okay.       Cost of construction.       Access to buildings and or roads.       Local, State and National guidelines governing private airstrips. Crosswind strip if crosswinds are common in your area.       Safe, barrier free approaches, even if strip will never be used at night.;	Consider the following factors:   Flatness and/or the amount of work required to level the area.
However, instead of 'braiding' the elastic together now, place another one on top of the elastic, so that you have two loose elastics on top of the base one (at the stage of the the X formation).  Flick it on top of the two other elastics and do the same thing to the other side. ,	Start the process as outlined in method one. Grabbing one side of the base elastic, pull it away from the fork. Complete normally as for method one.  , Finished.
Be sure that the surface is not tilted, or the system will not work properly.  If the container you have is designed for a multi flow system, it should automatically turn the power on and off as the water levels in the container change. Thus, this is a safer and more efficient flood/drain system than those used in ebb and flows (see next section)  , Ensure that everything is working properly.	Place your six pots on a stable surface. Connect them with the PVC fittings and tubes. Put the plants in the small plant trays.
This is an especially useful method for removing small-to-medium-sized dents, and you may have more of these then you think. Examine your car carefully to find them all.; , Dents can typically be removed using this method if they are located on the metal panels of the trunk, hood, doors, roof, or fenders, and are not right along the edges on broad flat surfaces.To achieve the best results, use this method on shallow dents that do not contain major creases or paint damage, and that cover a surface area with a diameter of at least 3 inches (7.62 cm).  You will need a hair dryer, heavy-duty or thick rubber gloves for safe handling of the dry ice or compressed air in its liquid format, aluminum foil, and either a package of dry ice or a can of compressed air. You will need some of the following:   Heavy-duty insulated rubber-coated gloves. A full (or nearly full) can of compressed air. A package of dry ice. A hair dryer with adjustable temperature settings, such as "Low," "Medium," and "High," or "Cool," "Warm," and "Hot." Aluminum foil.  Turn on the hair dryer and use it to blow hot air over the dent and the surrounding area for one to two consecutive minutes.   The hair dryer should be set to medium and should be held between 5 and 7 inches (12.7 and 17.78 cm) away from the car's surface. Do not overheat the area in order to prevent the paint from becoming damaged due to overheating., Place a sheet of aluminum foil over the top of the dented area. This step should only be performed if you are using dry ice instead of compressed air. The purpose of this step is to keep the area warm while also protecting the paint from the dry ice, which can potentially damage the topcoat.  The gloves will protect you from frostbite and other injuries that can occur when your skin comes into contact with dry ice or liquified compressed air.  The rapid change in temperature from warm to cold will cause the surface of your vehicle to first expand (when heated) and then contract (when cooled).If you are using dry ice, grab a block of the ice with one hand, then gently rub it over the aluminum foil resting on top of the dented area. If you are using a can of compressed air, turn the can upside down, and spray the surface of the dented area to cover the area with a layer of liquid ice. There are some basic principles of science at work here: the pressure, volume, and temperature of a gas are all interconnected. While normally the can loses temperature as the gas is released, if you spray the can upside down the gas itself is cooled.Either method will only require a brief application. The surface panels of most modern vehicles are made of relatively thin and lightweight material and they will cool very quickly. You will likely not see any change after the first 30-50 seconds of application, if not sooner still.  A few moments after you have applied the dry ice or compressed air, you may hear a popping sound that will indicate the dent has been removed. The rapid temperature shift will usually make the material reform its original shape.   If you used dry ice, remove and dispose of the aluminum foil after the dent has been removed. If you applied liquid ice by means of compressed air, wait for the white foam to dissipate from the surface of the car, then wipe residue away with a gentle cloth.  For certain dents a single application may not be enough. If you see improvement but a dent is still noticeable, you can begin the process of heating and cooling again. However, do no overuse this process (especially in a single day). While the rapid temperature changes can reshape your car exterior, the extreme cold is potentially hazardous to the paint.	Find your car's dents. Evaluate the dents. Obtain the materials needed to remove the dent. Apply heat to the dented panel. Insulate the dented area of the panel (if applicable). Put on the heavy-duty gloves. Apply the dry ice or liquified compressed air. Wait for a little while. Repeat the process as needed.
If you are only expecting 20 or 30 people for an audition, even your garage may do. If you need a larger space, try renting out hotels or venues function rooms. These often are quite cheap to rent during the day, which is the most likely time to hold your auditions.; ,   If you're auditioning people to become members of a band, you may need to supply amps, leads, microphones etc. If you need a drummer for a band, you will most certainly need to have a drum kit available. Not many drummers will cart their expensive kits to an audition. Other instruments won't be necessary as most people will only play their own instruments If you're auditioning an actor or singer for a musical, you may need microphones also, and a stereo or PA to play music through. But more importantly you may need someone to play out parts with them. This should not be too difficult to organise if you are in charge of hiring people!  ,   Open Auditions are where you have a start time for auditions and anyone can turn up. This is done on a first come first serve basis. Set Auditions are where you do not list the time or location of your auditions on your advertisements. You just put a contact number up, and when people ring you, you give them more information and a specific time and date for their audition. Though this sounds more complicated, this is often easier and seems better organised. Also, you know how many people are going to show up before they arrive. Posters should follow this guide: AUDITIONS What type(s) of performer is required Age and sex requirements Time and Date (optional) Length of audition Contact number, website and email    , If you're not artistic/confident enough to make your own get them professionally done. Posters put up in venues, music shops, colleges and schools, drama clubs etc. are often the most effective. But there's no harm in placing advertisements in local papers. Another way to guarantee auditions is to ring Talent Agencies and Agents which can be found in your Yellow Pages. Only good performers are picked up by these businesses. Make sure to be safe about where you decide to put up your advertisements. ,, Also ask them to bring passport style, photos so when you're debating which to accept afterwards you will remember every person. This form should have:     Name Phone Number Address Email Address Age    , Often the most talented are the busiest! So try to accommodate them in a separate/private audition.  The panel should always consist of at least two people, at least one man and one woman, unless you are running an all male or all female band. This looks more professional and one on one auditions can be disconcerting. ,, Don't give away your decision either and tell every person auditioning that you'll get back to them.	Find a place large enough to hold the audition. Get the equipment you require. Decide whether you are going to hold 'open' or 'set' auditions. Make your advertisements. Set an exact time limit on a person's performance and make sure they know this before they come.  , If they are auditioning for a part in a film or play, provide them with a script as soon as they decide that they would like to audition.  , Create forms for when people arrive. Try to accept every person that rings for an audition, even if they can't make in on your assigned day. Get together a panel of interviewers, and a few people to organise queues etc, if holding a large audition. Get the organisers to make a few refreshments for the people auditioning, this shows you care!  ,Make sure the place where the people are auditioning is separate from the people waiting to interview, this helps calm nerves and will make it more fair  , Always give constructive criticism if you have any but don't be mean. Once the auditions are over, make your decisions and inform the person you've accepted first, then ring/email each person saying that you're sorry but that you'll keep their form in case another opening becomes available.
Dress like you would if you were the right age to see the movie. (Girls, don't overdo it.) Don't wear high school logos on clothes (college and university logos are great, though - if you look like a college student, people automatically assume you're at least 17 or older). Guys - if you can grow a little facial hair, don't shave two days before the movie so you look older. Also, try to lower your voice to an older-sounding tone.  Figure out what you're doing ahead of time. Practice your lines at home so you're comfortable saying them. For example, if you look over 17, pick a fake birthday ahead of time. The easiest way to catch someone lying about their age is by asking them about their birthday. If you stutter trying to think of a valid birthday, they won't let you in. If you look like you're 18, say your birthday was today and you left your ID at home.  If you can, go with friends that are over 17. It makes it less obvious that you're under 17. Going with a friend might make it a bit less nerve racking if it is your first time sneaking in, and if you do get caught you're not alone.  If you get caught sneaking in, don't panic! Make an excuse such as, "Oh, my parents are in there, I just had to go to the bathroom". Sound realistic when you do. If you get caught doing the movie switching method, a good excuse is "Oh, sorry! I guess I got the wrong entrance." You might want to look around while saying it to make it more realistic. Never run away if you get caught. That will not only anger whoever it is that chases you down, but also draws even more attention...possibly an ill-mannered manager. While making an excuse can save you from being caught, running immediately makes you look guilty and will have you kicked out of the theater.	Look the part. Practice and prepare yourself. Go with others. Figure out your escape plan.
Stains tend to pick up and accentuate flaws in the surface, just like wood stain does with wood knots. Keep in mind that staining is not the same as covering.   You may consider laying new concrete, if the surface is cracked and deteriorating. Hire professionals to pour the concrete.; , Cement stain is semi-transparent and color is added and mixed just as it is with traditional house paint.   You can also buy acid stain; however, it can be more difficult to apply yourself than other concrete stains. It will also take longer to apply because you must neutralize the stain after it sets. You can choose 2 different colors of concrete stain to create a marble effect. Use a lighter color as your base coat, and a darker color on the second coat.  You should always test the color before applying to an entire section of concrete.   Clean the section of concrete with an industrial washing product, like TSP. Apply the stain according to package directions, usually by wetting the concrete and applying with a roller. , One gallon of paint will cover 200 to 400 square feet. Buy enough to do 2 coats, if you want darker, more even coverage.  Work in 4 x 4 foot sections.  These will show through the concrete stain.  Move on to the next section, working across the section of concrete you need to clean.  You need to be careful not to track on any dirt, or the stain will not be even.   Consider setting up tape or barricades during the cleaning and staining process, if you are near a public area, such as a sidewalk.  Tape it down with painter's tape, if possible.  You can also apply with a roller, but the paint sprayer will apply even coverage.  Days without wind are also best for using paint sprayers.  It should be a mist of water, light enough so that water does not gather and run, leading to an uneven application.  Spray sections of 4 feet (1.2 m) by 4 feet (1.2 m) and then move on to the next section.   If you are using 2 different colors to create a marble effect, do not wait to apply the second coat. You can apply it immediately after the first coat.  This is usually 24 hours.  If so, wet the top of the stain with water and apply a second coat just as you did the first.  Check the surface for any sections that were not fully covered. Spray them by hand. , Choose a time when the concrete patch is shaded.  Use a roller with a very long handle for floor application.  Move in 1 direction. It will be white when it rolls on, but it will dry clear. ,, Your surface is ready to use.  Apply new coats of sealer every 3 to 4 years.	Assess the current state of your concrete. Go to any hardware store that has a large paint section. Bring home a sample of the color you would like to test out. Measure the square footage of your concrete section.  , Buy enough concrete stain and sealant to cover your concrete. Wash the surface of your concrete with water and a heavy duty cleaner. If you have grease or oil stains, find a product that is specially formulated to remove them before you wash. Spray the area with a high pressure spray nozzle until there are no more soap bubbles. Put on clean, dry shoes once you wash the concrete. Throw plastic drop cloths over decks, stairs, flowers, grass and other pathways. Rent a paint sprayer, if you do not own 1. Wait to apply the stain when there is partial or full shade. Spray the concrete with water, using your garden hose and spray nozzle. Spray the cement with the stain using the paint sprayer. Allow your first coat of stain to dry according to package directions. Decide if you want to do another coat to achieve a more vibrant color. Pour some stain into a plastic spray bottle. Dab the sprayed stain with a wet paper towel to incorporate the hand-sprayed section.  , Wait 24 hours after your last coat before sealing it. Apply the sealer with a 3/8-inch-nap paint roller. Roll a coat of sealer onto the surface. Wait 2 hours.  , Apply a second coat of sealer perpendicular to the first.  , Allow it to dry. Wash the surface of the cement every year with a heavy duty cleaner.
Your car comes with a jack so you can change one tire at a time, but you'll need to have the entire car off the ground to rotate your tires. The easiest and cheapest way to do this is to get a set of jack stands, which run somewhere around $30. DO NOT try to do this with multiple jacks.          If you don't want to buy jack stands, you can use large wood blocks. Do not use cinder blocks because they can break, risking injury to you and damage to your vehicle.; , Reduce the risk of the vehicle tipping when in the air by working on a flat surface. Engage the parking brake before you start the job, and block the wheels you haven't jacked to keep the car from rolling forward or back while you work.          If your driveway is on an incline, or if you don't have a driveway, this won't take much time and you can to complete this project in the empty corner of a big box-store parking lot.  While your car is still on the ground, use a flathead screwdriver and remove the hubcaps so the lug nuts are exposed. Then, with the lug wrench, loosen the lug nuts holding the tire to the axle. DO NOT remove the nuts, just loosen them slightly to make removing them easier when the car is in the air.          Upturn one of the hubcaps to use as a bowl. Place all of your lug nuts in this bowl so you don't lose or misplace any.  Use your jack to raise each corner of the car and then install the jack stand. Consult your owner's manual to determine the proper placement of the jack.          Using four jack stands would be the easiest and quickest way to complete the job, but some people get rightly nervous having the entire weight of the car in the air.If you only have two jack stands, you'll have to raise and lower the car a few times with your jack, since the procedure calls for you to switch the front tires with the back tires. Either way, planning the pattern of the rotation is a smart idea before starting to remove any tires.  Directional tires have tread that goes one way, usually with grooves designed to channel water and road-grit outward to improve handling. For this reason, you can't switch driver's-side directional tires to the passenger's side, and vice versa. Non-directional tires all look the same and can be safely switched between the passenger and driver side.          For directional tires, rotating the tires means you'll need to switch the front driver's side tire with the rear driver's side, and the front passenger's side tire with the rear passenger's side tire. For non-directional tires, the usual rotation pattern is to rotate the front driver's side tire to the rear passenger's side. The front passenger's side gets the rear driver's side tire, and both rear tires move straight up the car. This pattern ensures that you'll get a complete rotation of the tires after two rotations, ensuring the longest possible tire life.  Roll the tire to the new location. Keep track of the lug nuts by keeping them close to the axle from which they were removed. The threads should be uniform, but generally you'll keep them with their location on the car, not the tire.  If you've got the entire car off the ground, just move the tires to their new locations, place them on the studs, and hand-tighten the lug nuts.          If you've only got two jack stands, and you've got them both occupied with the back of the car, say, then you'll start by removing both rear tires. Then, you'll need to move the rear driver's side tire to the front driver's side location. Jack that spot up with your jack, remove the tire, install the new tire, hand-tighten the lug nuts, and lower the jack. Then move that front tire to the rear passenger's side, etc. Continue moving around the car, rotating the tires in the proper pattern.  With your jack, raise each location up off the jack stand until you can safely remove it, then lower the car. Make sure you've tightened each tire on hand-tight before you do this. You should be able to wobble the tire back and forth.  Most cars have 4 or 5 lug nuts. When the car is lowered completely, tighten the lug nuts with your lug wrench by tightening one nut, plus a quarter-turn, then the nut directly across from it, then back to the nut next to the first, etc.          If you have one, you can now use a torque wrench to finalize tightening lug nuts to spec. For most cars it is somewhere between 80–100 feet (24.4–30.5 m)lbs. For trucks, 90–140 feet (27.4–42.7 m)lbs.  Check the air pressure in your tires and add some air if necessary.	Get some jack stands. Find a level work surface. Remove the hubcaps and loosen the lug nuts. Raise the car in the air. Check the rotation pattern of your tires.Tires are either directional or non-directional. Remove the lug nuts from the first tire you've raised and remove it. Rotate the tires in the correct pattern. Lower the car. Tighten lug nuts using the star pattern. Place hubcaps back on the wheels by replacing the lug nuts.
Your engine bay gets extremely hot while the engine is running, so poking around the engine bay before it has a chance to cool can result in serious burns. Allow the engine to cool for a few hours before opening the hood and looking for evidence of a coolant leak.If the hood still feels warm, the engine inside is likely very hot. If your vehicle has been overheating, it will take even longer for it to cool enough to be safe to touch.  Before starting any automotive project, you should put on the appropriate safety gear. Because you’ll be dealing with coolant that may be leaking, eye protection should be considered mandatory for this project. Gloves are optional, but may protect your hands from scratches or bumps as you work.Always wear eye protection when dealing with coolant leaks, as they may drip or spray under pressure. Glasses or goggles are both acceptable forms of eye protection for this project.  Another common point of failure in coolant systems is the radiator cap. When functioning properly, the radiator cap can release excess pressure that builds up in your coolant system, but over time it can become worn out or stuck. If the radiator cap looks rusty, is corroded or caked in grime, it may be the cause of your coolant issues. Replace your radiator cap simply by unscrewing it and screwing in a replacement.Radiator caps are inexpensive and can usually be purchased at your local auto parts store. Never remove the radiator cap from an engine that is still warm. It could spray hot coolant and burn you.  The water pump in your vehicle pumps the water and coolant mixture through the engine and into the radiator where air flow helps to dissipate the heat. Look for signs that your water pump is leaking or has failed if it is visible in your engine bay. The water pump is belt driven, so inspect the belt for damage that indicates that the water pump pulley has stopped moving and has been rubbing against the belt.Without a properly functioning water pump, your engine will not be able to dissipate the heat it produces as it runs, causing the vehicle to overheat. If the belt powering the water pump is damaged, it will have to be replaced after you put in a new water pump. If you are unsure of where to locate the water pump in your vehicle, refer to its service manual or the website for the auto maker.  Look at the hoses traveling from the radiator and to the engine, then follow them along for as far as you can. If any of the hoses are kinked, that will cause the coolant system to fail to function properly. Cracks may also indicate a leak, but even if it isn’t leaking yet, a cracked coolant hose should be replaced before it begins to leak. Keep an eye out for damage to the hoses or signs of rubbing from the serpentine or accessory belts.If one of the belts has been rubbing on a coolant line, they will both likely need to be replaced. Make sure to install the new ones with enough clearance to avoid rubbing the belt on the hose. Leaks in your coolant can result in puddles beneath your vehicle and overheating.  Replace radiator hoses that are leaking or are otherwise damaged.	Allow the engine to cool. Put on the appropriate safety gear. Check the radiator cap for damage. Visually inspect the water pump if you can. Assess damage to your coolant hoses.
Use all-purpose fertilizer like 10-10-10 in the amount listed on the label. For the best results, switch to a fertilizer high in phosphorous (such as 10-16-10) just before the plant blooms.To apply fertilizer: granular fertilizer can be sprinkled on the soil with or without a spreader. Water-soluble fertilizer should be applied using a sprayer or watering can. For either method, always measure your application based on the fertilizer's instruction label.  Daisies don’t require a set watering schedule; in fact, they prefer the soil to dry out somewhat between waterings. Check the top 4-5 in (10.2-12.7 cm) of soil – if it’s dry, water the daisies deeply from underneath so that their leaves don’t get wet. The best time to do this is in the morning.Daisies don’t need watering in the winter unless the weather is unseasonably dry. If that is the case, water them 1-2 in (2.5-5.1 cm) every other month.  Weeds can attract parasites and starve daisies of nutrients. Make sure to wear gardening gloves and remove weeds by hand or with a short-handled weeding tool regularly. This is especially important when your daisies are still young.For less necessary maintenance of weeds, apply 2-3 in (5.1-7.6 cm) of mulch in mid-to-late spring when the ground warms and dries from winter. Keep a 2-3 in (5.1-7.6 cm) circumference around the plant base free from mulch., Throughout the growing season, prune away any dead leaves and snip the flower heads off whenever their appearance begins to fade. This encourages regrowth.Stop deadheading the daisies near the end of the growing season if you plan to collect the seeds. The end of the growing season will vary based on your location., Trim down your daisies where the stem meets the foliage, approximately 3 in (7.6 cm) above soil level.Wait until the last killing frost. You can find the date range of freezes by looking up your gardening zone online. After trimming down, protect the perennials’ root balls with a layer of mulch. You can use straw, hay or leaves., Dig deeply into the ground about 6-8 in (15.2-20.3 cm) away from the plants’ centers. Loosen the roots by rocking the shovel, and lift the plants gently out of the ground by the root balls. Carefully pull the clump apart and discard the woody centers. Replant wherever desired, each group of daisies 12 in (30.5 cm) away from other plants.Autumn is the preferable time to divide your daisies, however you can divide them in springtime if necessary. When dividing your daisies, place them gently in a temporary container to move them, and replant them right away.  Use a single application of fertilizer just before the new spring growth appears, or as soon as it pushes up through the ground.Side dress with compost or apply no more than 1 pound (0.45 kg) of nitrogen per 1,000 square feet (305 square meters).	Fertilize two weeks after planting and once a month thereafter. Water daisies as needed. Mulch around the daisies and/or hand weed as needed. Deadhead and prune the daisies as needed. Cut down your daisies at the end of the growing season. Divide your daisies when they lack space. Maintain your existing perennials.
Detergent jugs, and milk jugs are all great choices. Large water jugs and juice jugs may also work, as long as they have a handle. Most importantly, make sure that the lid screws on. A cap that you pop on and off will not work for this due to the water pressure., This is especially important if you are recycling a detergent bottle. The easiest way to clean the bottle is to fill it partway with water, close the cap tightly, shake it, then pour the water out. When you are done, remove the label and any glue residue left behind., Keep the cap on the bottle. Use a nail to punch holes into the lid. You can also use a needle or thumbtack instead. Punch as many holes as you want.  If the cap is too hard to piece, heat the nail over a flame first. Hold the nail with a pair of pliers so that you don't scorch your fingers.If your bottle had a thick lid (ie: detergent bottle), use a drill and a ⅛-inch (0.32-centimeter) drill bit instead., Do this with a drill and a ½-inch (1.27-centimeter) drill bit. This will help make the water flow smoother and help release pressure., Unscrew the cap, then fill the bottle with water from the sink or hose. Close the cap when you are done. How much you fill it depends on how much weight you are able to carry; the more you fill it, the heavier it will become.  If you used a drill bit, you will need to rinse the bottle out first to get rid of any plastic dust.  Make sure that the cap is on tightly. Use the handle to carry the jug over to your plant. Use your other hand to hold the jug by the bottom and tilt the cap downward.	Choose a large bottle with a handle and a screw-on lid. Clean out the bottle and remove any labels. Punch holes into the cap with a nail. Consider adding a hole above the handle. Fill the bottle with water. Use the watering can.
The way you hold the neck of the guitar effects how long you can barre chords before your hand cramps and hurts. Anchor your thumb close the center-back of the neck and not over-the-top as if it was peeking from the fretboard. Placing your thumb in the center-back of the guitar's neck should help you with the proper form. The proper form will increase your hand’s stamina.Look at the angle of your arm and wrists. You will notice that the more acute the angle of your wrist, the less strength you have in that hand. Keep all your joints from your wrist to your fingers at natural rounded angles. There isn’t a golden rule with hand placement. Jimi Hendrix held his guitar in a way that his thumb wrapped around the guitar. Do whatever makes you comfortable. In this example, you’d hold the guitar like a tennis racket.  The proper finger placement helps your sound and your hand's stamina. Place your fingers close to the fret that is closest to the bridge, instead of placing your finger dead-center between the frets. This helps decrease the force needed to barre chords.   You should also get into the habit of arching each finger when playing notes or chords. This way your fingers don't touch other strings and hinder the sound., It is common to feel stressed and strained while playing the guitar. This is especially true for beginner guitarist. It is normal to feel pain when trying out a new guitar shape. When reaching for these tougher hand shapes, it’s important to take note of how the rest of your body is reacting. Make sure you have the proper fingering, then take a deep breath and let your shoulders rest.   Stiffness will only hinder a musician. Keep a relaxed posture to work the instrument into a natural position and feeling., When you are practicing the guitar for longer periods of time, make sure you take breaks. A good guitarist will take productive breaks to ensure the practicing mentality isn’t lost. Take a five minute break to drink water or go on a walk. Avoid sitting on the couch and watching TV on your break.   Maintain your desire to improve as a guitarist. Keep a musical biography around to keep you inspired.	Hold the guitar properly. Have the proper finger placement. Relax your posture. Take productive breaks.
You need to remove all of them, no matter what is said about string tension. Do it by any means but don't destroy your guitar.; , Once all the strings are off, get a microfiber towel (preferably) or a non-lint rag, regular, plain ol' tap water, fine steel wool, sandpaper, a set of screwdrivers, pliers, and tape (only use painter's tape or automotive tape).  It doesn't matter, but in this tutorial we will start with the neck.  Use the screwdrivers and the pliers to snug up all screws and the nut and washers on the peg.  Wipe the neck down, scrubbing inside the frets. You don't need to water a dead tree, get off all excess water, and do not ever use oils or other guitar "care" products.  Tighten all screws and watch you don't mess with your set up. Do not use any guitar "care" products.  They will become dirty and have a terrible sound to them.  This part is time consuming, so you may skip it if you like. Tape off the frets, and use the steel wool to clean each and every fret. Remember that the steel wool will scratch your fretboard, so tape off right at the fret.	Start by taking off the strings. Gather your tools. Start with the neck or body. Make sure all tuning pegs are snug but not tight. Dip a small portion of the towel into the water. Wipe down the body, limiting the water used. Spray contact cleaner in your switches and pots. Clean the frets, if you want. Once your guitar is clean, restring it and play.
A small project can involve making a mini-hothouse using a plastic tub about 2 by 3 feet (61 by 91 cm) in size.   Clean the tub thoroughly and line the bottom of the tub with pebbles to keep water away from the potted plants you will place on top of the pebbles. Fill pots with potting soil and add a few seeds. Sprinkle a little potting soil over the seeds and water lightly. Place plastic wrap over the tub and put it into a sunny spot. Water periodically when the soil becomes dry, but take care not to over-water; just be sure the soil is kept moist. Remove the wrap when the plants are 2 inches (5 cm) in height. Allow the plants to grow uncovered until the weather and conditions are right to transplant them into your regular garden.; ,   Choose a spot that receives 6 to 8 hours of direct sunlight daily. Be sure you have easy access to water. Find a site protected against prevailing north winds. Purchase a greenhouse or hothouse kit or build one yourself using a frame, glass, Plexiglas or plastic film. You can find plans online or in how-to magazines or books. Determine the floor you want. It could be concrete, dirt or gravel, for example. Concrete or brick will help hold the heat, but could cause mold and bacteria to grow because they also retain moisture. Gravel will allow for good drainage, but will not be as warm.    If you are depending upon solar heat, provide a way to vent air should it become too hot. Louvered windows or flaps you can raise or lower will provide ventilation. Consider using a shade cloth to keep temperatures down during very hot days. You may choose to install a heating system to keep temperatures constant. Your hothouse may need to have access to electricity. Attaching your hothouse to your home will let you heat it using your home heating system. Keep the temperature at about 80 degrees F (27 degrees C). Anything hotter or colder will not allow optimum growth. Keep air fresh by allowing for ventilation. Don't make your hothouse airtight. Keep humidity levels up by using a misting system or by using tubs of water in the hothouse to add moisture to the air.    Tomatoes and cucumbers will need feeding each time you water. Other plants may need less. Check with a local professional gardener or online to learn about recommended watering and feeding levels for the types of plants you are growing.    Plan your year's vegetable crops before placing your order so your hothouse garden will be well thought-out. If you choose to transplant seedlings outdoors, do so according to your climate zone.    Check on the progress of your vegetables, make adjustments to the amount of heat, ventilation, and light. Take care of daily routines such as watering and fertilizing. You can stop small problems from becoming crop failures by catching plant illness, infestations, and other problems early, before they've done irreparable damage to your plants.	Make a mini-hothouse to get a head start on your garden. Decide on the materials and location for your larger hothouse. Decide how your hothouse will be heated. Water and fertilize as needed according to the types of plants you are growing and what they require to thrive. Order or purchase seeds from a reputable garden center. Walk through your greenhouse or hothouse daily.
Feed a length of all-purpose thread through the eye of a sewing needle. Double up the thread, then knot the end using a standard overhand knot.   The length of the thread will vary based on individual preference. Keep in mind that the finished length of your bead chain on the hair clip will be half the total length of the stand itself. Double up the thread, keeping it bent over the eye of the needle, and knot both ends together at the opposite end. Trim away any excess thread beyond the knot.  Thread seed beads onto the strand by sliding them over the needle and down the length of the thread.   You'll need to choose seed beads that have a wide enough opening to fit over the sewing needle. The opening must be too small to fit over the knot at the end of your thread, however. Use any color or mix of colors you'd like for this project. You can create patterns or thread the beads randomly. Continue threading beads until nearly the entire length of thread has been covered. Make sure that you leave enough thread at the top of the strand to knot off, though.  Tie a standard overhand knot above the top bead of your strand. Position the knot as close to the top bead as possible, and make sure this knot is large enough to block the beads from falling off.   Trim away any excess thread beyond this top knot. Note that both ends should be knotted at the completion of this step.  Open the clip and slide the beaded strand inside. The center of the bead chain should should be aligned with the fold of the open hair clip.   Snap clips work best for this project since you can fit the strand of beads directly around the bottom snap prong of the clip. Make sure that the ends of the strand extend outward through the front opening of the clip. If desired, you can knot or glue the stand of beads together at the base of the hair clip. Doing so shouldn't be necessary in most cases, however, and the beads should remain firmly in place even without the use of adhesive.  The hair clip should be done and ready to wear. Fit it into your hair so that the ends of the beaded strand hang down.	Double thread the needle. Feed the seed beads onto the needle and thread. Knot the opposite end. Slip the strand into the hair clip. Wear the clip.
Remember, cashew plants grown into trees, so buy your pot keeping this in mind. Place pebbles near the hole with a small net.; , You can buy potting soil or you can make it by mixing garden soil, compost, coir or coconut fiber, limestone, sand and fertilizers.  Make sure the roots are free and firmly placed on the soil. Cover the roots with more soil till the pot is full. Press down with your hands.  Remember this is a plant of the tropics. Never keep it inside air-conditioned rooms. Water often and keep the soil moist, especially in the first few weeks. Fertilize about twice a year (especially during flowering and nut development) with nitrogen,  phosphorus and zinc.  when the fruit turns red, it indicates that the nut is ready. Remove the entire thing or pick it from the ground if it has fallen. Remove the nutshell from the fruit. Send the nut for processing or remove the shell yourself with precautions. The juices from the shell are known to cause irritation in a lot of people. See video below.	Buy a large flower pot. Fill 3/4th of the pot with potting soil. Create a hollow in the potting soil and place your cashew plant on it. keep your pot in a sunny spot. A cashew nut grows in a shell attached beneath a fruit or apple. Enjoy your cashew plant.
Scare him by pretending to go shopping for expensive gifts you want him to buy for you. This is especially effective if your relationship is still new. When you plan dates with your boyfriend, tell him to take you to a fancy restaurant. Act like you aren’t being spoiled but it’s your right to demand expensive dinners., Make him your personal chauffeur for a few hours or a day. Get him to wait for you in the car and not do anything else but be at your beck and call. Just when you know he's about to reach his limit, text or call him and let him know that it was a joke. Don't go overboard and make him resent you.  After a long day of getting him to run around for you, don’t give him a chance to get romantic or close to you. Tell him to take you home so that you can sleep. Once you see that he's annoyed, show him that you are considerate of him.  Cancel plans with your boyfriend and tell him that it's because you have to go out with your friends. Make sure that you don't cancel anything important and that you don't go too far and make him feel alienated.  Pretend to get irritated for the smallest reasons and be bitchy. If he thinks it's PMS affecting you, pretend to pick a fight about how he doesn't understand you and knows nothing about women.   Don't go over the top and make him question your character. Make it clear that you are exaggerating.  Nothing can ever be enough for you. He buys you roses, you want chocolate. He hugs you twice a day, you want him to hug you 3 times a day. He talks to you for 1 hour, you want him for 3. Sarcasm and tone are effective to convey feign displeasure.	Tell him that you’re a princess and deserved to be treated that way. Get him to drive you around. End your time with him abruptly. Go out with your friends. Make a fuss about everything. Always want more.
Dividing plants prevents overcrowding and promotes the maximum amount of blooms. Diving also cleans and rejuvenates old clumps. Dividing mums should be done in the spring when new growth first appears., Lift the plant from the hole once you have cleared it of the dirt. Shake any excess dirt from its roots. Remove any diseased or dead parts of the plant.  Some plants will be able to separated with your fingers, others may need a knife--it depends on the size of your plant. Try not to damage the roots any more than necessary.Using a sharp garden knife will cause the least amount of damage to the roots, as it will be easier to cut them and there will be less hacking involved. Divide the plant in half again if you desire smaller plants.  They should be planted in well-drained, nutrient-rich, loose organic soil.	Divide your plants every three to five years. Dig your plant up, making certain that you are not harming the roots. Divide the clump of roots and plant in half. Replant the newly divided mums as soon as possible.

You can buy an inexpensive firm pillow from your local department or home goods store. If you don’t want to purchase a new pillow, you can just use an old one you already own.A firm pillow will work best, since it’ll hold its shape better than a plush one.; , Grab an old dress tie and use it to tie off the pillow to create indentations for the CPAP mask. Tie the pillow tightly two-thirds from one end.A dress tie is more durable and will feel better to lie on than string, twine, or rope. If you don't have a dress tie, try using a soft ribbon or narrow strip of fabric.  You’d normally place a pillow on the bed horizontally, or so the longer sides face the head and foot of the bed. Instead, place the pillow vertically, so the shorter sides face the bed’s head and foot. The end of the pillow with the tie one-third down from its edge should face the foot of the bed.Try lying down on your side on the one-third section of the pillow. The tie should create spaces that comfortably fit your CPAP mask. If necessary, adjust the tie’s location to find the most comfortable position.	Purchase a firm pillow. Tie it two-thirds down from one end. Place it on the bed vertically instead of horizontally.
Use a Mohs hardness pick to determine the degree of mineral hardness. Determining whether the concrete is soft, medium, or hard will allow you to fine-tune the polishing process.   Use the tools supplied in the kit to test the hardness of the concrete against the hardness of other minerals. The softest mineral that is capable of scraping the concrete is harder than the concrete, placing the concrete's level of hardness directly below that mineral.; , Prepare a solution of warm water and household detergent, then scrub the concrete thoroughly using that solution and a bristle brush. Rinse away any suds and let the area dry.For especially stubborn stains or mold, you might need to use a stronger cleanser. Hydrogen peroxide, ammonia, and TSP are common options, but do not mix these chemicals together. Choose and use only one chemical. Wear protective gloves and eye goggles before handling any chemicals. Keep the area well-ventilated, too.  If there are any cracks in your concrete surface, you should repair them before you polish it.Purchase specialized concrete crack filler. Follow the instructions on the package to mix the filler, then squeeze it directly into the crack. Allow the filler to set completely before moving onto the next step.  You'll need to use a specialized tool to grind concrete; a standard sander will not be enough. You can usually rent concrete grinders from most hardware stores.   Before agreeing to rent the grinder, make sure that it feels comfortable enough for you to use. Note that renting a grinder can cost as much as $1000 per week, so this project may not be especially cost-effective if you're only working with a small concrete surface.  Before handling the grinder, you should prepare yourself by wearing a dust mask, gloves, safety goggles, and ear plugs.While not strictly necessary, you may also want to wear a helmet to protect your head in the event of an accident. This is especially important if you are working in an area currently undergoing other construction. Wear work shoes with a good grip, too. Even if you feel fairly confident about your home improvement skills, accidents happen, and no-slip shoes can help prevent accidents caused by sliding, slipping, or falling over.  If you need to remove sealer, stain, or other contaminants that wouldn't wash off, start with a 40-grit grinding disc. If you do not need to remove anything, though, skip directly to an 80-grit disc.   Note that these discs must be metal-bonded diamond discs. Non-diamond discs will not be hard enough to grind down the concrete. Keep in mind that lower grit values indicate coarser discs. In other words, 40-grit discs are coarser than 80-grit discs. Follow the instructions that come with your grinder to determine the proper way to attach discs and power the machine. Pass over the entire concrete surface, gradually working from one corner to the diagonally opposite corner.  You will need to use at least two or three more grinding discs. Choose discs that are progressively higher (less coarse) in grit-size.The exact grit sizes may vary depending on the hardness of your concrete. As a general guideline, however, follow the 40-grit disc with an 80-grit disc. Move onto 150-grit after that, followed by 200-grit, and possibly 400-grit. Pass over the entire surface with each new disc. For each new disc level, the idea is to buff away any scratches made from the previous grinding disc. Accomplish this task by crossing over scratch lines in a perpendicular direction.  Spray liquid chemical hardener over the surface to help solidify the concrete.The best time to densify the concrete will vary depending on the original degree of hardness. Return to the results of the Mohs hardness test. For soft to medium concrete, apply the densifier after using the 80-grit disc. For medium to hard concrete, apply the densifier after using the 200-grit disc. Follow the manufacturer's instructions when determining how to apply the densifier. Typically, you'll need to pour the product into a small sprayer. Use the nozzle of the sprayer to coat the entire concrete surface, then let it dry before continuing.  After your primary grinding and densifying, attach a 3000-grit disc to the grinder. Work over the entire concrete surface with this disc, moving from one corner to the diagonally opposite one.   This grit on this disc is so fine that it will actually begin polishing the surface. You can skip this step if absolutely necessary, but following it will give the finished concrete a high-gloss appearance.  Grinding the concrete produces plenty of dust and debris. After you finish all of the grinding, you should vacuum as much debris as possible using a shop vac.   Note that some concrete grinders come with their own vacuum. In these instances, use that vacuum instead of a separate shop vac. You can also vacuum the surface in between disc switches, but doing so is not typically necessary. One thorough vacuuming before you buff the concrete should suffice.  Remove the grinding disc from your concrete grinder and attach a burnishing pad. Pass over the entire concrete surface using this pad.Working the concrete with the burnishing pad should buff the concrete and make it notably smooth. If you do not have a burnishing pad for your concrete grinder, or if the machine does not have an appropriate setting for use with a burnishing pad, use a low-speed brush-style buffer instead.  Choose a water-based or solvent-based concrete sealer and follow the manufacturer's instructions when applying. Some sealers need to be rolled, while others should be sprayed onto the surface.Sealers protect the concrete against grease, dirt, and other stains. Moreover, using a glossy sealer should give the polished concrete more of a sheen. No matter which type you use, the standard coverage rate is 250 to 300 square feet (23.2 to 27.9 square meters) of concrete per 1 gallon (4 L) of sealer. Apply two thin coats instead of one heavy coat. Wait for two to four hours for the first coat to dry before applying a second, then apply the second coat in a direction lying perpendicular to the first coat. After applying the second coat, wait another two or four hours before moving onto the next step.  Pass over the sealed surface once more with the burnishing pad or buffer. Work slowly and thoroughly, covering the entire surface at an even pace.   Move in the direction lying opposite/perpendicular to the direction in which your applied your last layer of sealer. When you finish this final pass, the concrete should look as smooth and glossy as finished stone.  Allow the final coat of sealer to completely dry before you actively use the concrete surface.   The exact amount of time will vary depending on the manufacturer, but it will usually be between 24 and 72 hours. After you wait the appropriate amount of time, the polished concrete should be finished and ready for active use.	Evaluate the concrete. Clean the surface. Repair any cracks. Acquire a concrete grinder. Wear protective gear. Grind the concrete with the coarsest disc. Progress through several grit sizes. Apply densifier in the middle of the process. Pass over the concrete with 3000-grit. Vacuum any debris. Switch to a burnishing pad. Apply one or two thin coats of concrete sealer. Burnish the surface once more. Wait at least 24 hours before use.
Draw a thin bead of tacky glue down the center of the barrette base.   Alternatively, you can lay a dot a glue directly beneath the estimated position of each stud. You'll need to line up the studs beside the base of the barrette to determine how many you'll use and how far apart to space the glue dots.; , Arrange a line of pyramid-style studs over the barrette, lining them up so that the flat edges face one another. Press the back of each stud firmly into the applied adhesive, making sure it sticks, and use as many studs as needed to cover the full length of the barrette.Check the studs before lining them up. Ideally, the studs should be just a little wider than the width of the barrette. Before arranging the studs, fold out the prongs of each stud so that they lie completely flat. Wipe away any excess glue with a damp paper towel. Allow the glue to dry completely before continuing to the next step.  After the glue dries, use pliers to bend the prongs of each stud around the barrette back.   Make sure that the prongs only bend around the backing and not around the clip portion of the barrette. If the pressure you apply causes the glue to weaken and the stud to break away, reapply the glue as needed. Wipe away any excess glue and let it dry completely before continuing.  Apply one or two coats of white spray primer to the front, back, and sides of the barrette. The studs must be completely coated, as well.   For best results, use a spray primer labeled for use with metal. You'll usually need to wait at least 30 minutes in between coats, but each primer can be a little different, so you should check and follow the label instructions to be sure.  Apply two to three coats of spray paint to the barrette. Choose any color you want and make sure that it covers the entire barrette, including the attached studs.   As with primer, you should use a spray paint approved for use with metal and follow the label instructions carefully. You will usually need to wait 30 minutes or so in between coats. Allow the paint to dry completely before wearing or otherwise handling the barrette. The final wait time can be as much as double the wait time given in between coats.  Once the paint is dry, the barrette is complete and ready to wear.	Apply glue to the barrette base. Line up the studs. Bend the prongs around the barrette. Coat the entire barrette with primer. Spray paint the barrette. Wear the barrette.
Make sure you have friends that love metal. The biggest reason to surround yourself with fellow metalheads is to share your thoughts on metal and learn from them but don’t exclude any of your friends who don’t appreciate or like metal. If they are your friends, you should be able to get along regardless of music preference.  Be sure to not be a jerk. Metal is aggressive, but this doesn't mean you have to act aggressively. Metal music is an expression of human emotions. Metal became so popular because it is an outlet for fans and musicians to channel the darker emotions of life.   All good art channels universal human emotions in a way that reacts with you. Metal certainly can have a moving effect on you, but don’t let that alter the way you treat others., Claiming to be a metalhead does not make you one.You should also realize that metal has almost nothing to do with fashion. It is okay to wear a t-shirt of your favorite band or a leather jacket, but you certainly don’t have to.   Metal is completely about being yourself; there is no model to follow. Be a metalhead out of your love for this music, not for the fame or the attention. Remember: being a metalhead does not mean making all of your conversations based around music., While style doesn’t dictate a metalhead, you can still look good while rocking out. Check online to see if your favorite band has merchandise that you like. The classic metalhead will have a handful of metal band t-shirts. It is similar to the punk aesthetic in this sense.   Wear guitar pick necklaces, or other instrument related things, if you can play the instrument.  There are several aspiring metalheads who get wrapped up in trending dress styles. Stores like Hot Topic can have plenty of gear, but a lot of their merchandise is for fading trends. If you find a t-shirt from a band you like that you think is cool, go ahead and buy it. Avoid spending all your money at a store like this.   Being a metalhead is all about authenticity. You cannot buy your way into a lifestyle. At the end of the day, being a metalhead is about the music and your devotion as a fan.	Be around fellow metalheads. Practice kindness. Respect the metalhead title. Wear metal clothing. Avoid poser trends.
There are various options for creating a sequin egg, and what you choose will depend on what you've got in mind for theme and/or the materials available. Some ideas include:   Color: The easiest way to approach color is to keep it all the same color. Or, you could use two matching colors. A little more complicated but amazing to look at is to make a rainbow colored egg. Pattern: Various pattern approaches include using small and large sequins, stripes, a motif such as a bunny or a letter or a cross.; , Use pencil or marker. If you're adding sequins randomly, simply proceed without adding any design.  Press the sequin against the blown-out egg (or plastic egg) and hold in place briefly to set.  Cover the entire egg.  This simple craft doesn't take a lot of effort before it's ready for display.	Decide how you want the egg to look. If you're using a specific design, draw this onto the egg as a guide. Place a little blob of glue onto the sequin. Continue with the remaining sequins. Done.
Coreopsis flowers can be sown directly in the plant bed during early to mid spring, after the frost has cleared but before the weather gets hot.; , Coreopsis flowers are native to areas with prairies and dry plains, and as a result, the plant thrives in warm, sunny locations. A south-facing spot that receives full sun often works best, but an east- or west-facing spot that receives at least partial sun will work, as well.  Use a garden fork or tiller to dig up and loosen the soil in your plant bed. The soil in the plant bed should be turned about 12 to 15 inches (31 to 38 cm) deep.  The compost enriches the quality of the soil, making it nutritional enough for new flowers to grow in.  These plants do not do well if the roots are water-logged, and good draining soil is essential. If your soil is dense and heavy, you may want to mix in 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 cm) of garden sand or peat moss, or vermiculite along with the compost.  Do so sparingly, preventing the flowers from growing too closely together to avoid crowding them out.  The soil you use to cover the seeds should be sandy, or otherwise loose. The seeds should not be planted too deep, but a covering of soil is necessary to protect them against the elements and against birds and other predators.  Water the area with a watering can or garden hose every day, except for rainy days, until the seeds germinate and seedlings start to form. This should only take one or two weeks. Do not allow the soil to dry out during this time.  By early summer, the plants should have several sets of leaves. At this point, it is best to space them apart by at least 12 inches (31 cm) to prevent the roots from tangling and competing for resources. You can thin the plants out by either snipping the stem off at soil level or by gently yanking weaker plants out of the ground.   To yank out a weaker seedling, insert a garden trowel about 5 to 6 inches (13 to 15 cm) into the ground, at a distance of about 2 to 3 inches (5 to 8 cm) away from the visible stem. Gradually ease the trowel toward the plant until the tip is about even with the center of the stem. Then, slowly and carefully lift the plant out roots out. This method works best when you can guarantee that you will not harm the roots of nearby plants or if you plan to transplant the removed flowers to another location.	Sow the seeds once the ground begins to thaw. Pick a sunny spot in your garden. Turn the soil. Amend the soil with compost.Mix 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 cm) of compost into the garden soil using a trowel or shovel. Improve the soil's ability to drain. Sprinkle the seeds over the soil. Cover the seeds with a light coating of soil. Keep the soil moist. Space the plants about 12 inches (31 cm) apart.
They should be 12 inches long and serve as your secondary color.   Use a ruler for an exact measurement. Fold each strip in half lengthwise. Try to be diligent in folding; the opposite side of the duct tape is a different color and will be seen. Repeat this 23 times. That's right, 23. Use a different color on occasion if you see fit.  Put weights on them (books, stacks of paper, boxes) to flatten them out.  Measure out 25 inches (63.5 cm) of your main color.   Fold each strip in half, just like you did with the horizontal strips. Do this 12 times. Cover all straps with weights for around an hour to flatten completely. They'll be easier to work with.  Rip off a piece of duct tape from your main color that's about 14 inches (36 cm) long.   Fold it in half sticky side out and make a crease. Line all 12 of the vertical strips along the crease. Get them up close and personal to each other. Reverse the seam and fold along the crease, adhering the ends together. Do this for both sides.  Make sure each strip is snug in its place.   For weaving, go under, over, under, over for the first strip and then over, under, over under for the second. Repeat. Throw in a different color here and there to mix it up.  This should go on the back of your purse. It acts as a liner.   Be as straight as possible--the strips will create lines. Don't skip this part; the liner makes your bag much sturdier. Continue weaving and constructing the lining as you go until you meet the far seam.  Leave half of the strip hanging, exposed.   Flip the entire piece over and fold the hanging edge over, taping it to the opposite side of the bag. Repeat for both sides.  These will serve as the sides. They should be at least 4 inches (10 cm) wide and 8 inches (20 cm) tall.   Fold your strip in half sticky side out. Lay on another strip sticky side up touching the upper, sticky edge of your first piece. Unfold the bottom piece so that the two pieces are totally stuck together. Fold the top sticky part over the middle, so that there is only sticky on the bottom edge. Flip it over and repeat.  If you're lost, we understand. Basically, halfway overlap the pieces of tape, flip it, halfway overlap them again and repeat until it is the size you want.   With the last one, fold it down so you have a sheet with no sticky band at the top or bottom.  You want your sides to be a bit bigger at the bottom than at the top.   Like a triangle...but not quite. The two sides should come to a point if the piece were to go on.  Count 8 strips in for centering.   This will not be centered; one side is supposed to be longer than the other.  This will adhere the sides together.   Fold it in half sticky side out. Connect the sides together. Repeat this three more times.  This hides any pieces that wound up not completely straight.   One side should be longer than the other. It's a flap-top purse; the longer side serves as the cover.  Attach velcro to keep the purse from opening needlessly.  Cut three strips a bit longer than half the length you want the strap to be.   Lay one down, sticky side up. Cover half of it with another strip, sticky side down. Fold one half over the other. Flip the piece and cover the now-exposed sticky edge halfway with the third sticky piece. Flip over again and fold the edge down so there are no exposed edges. Tape the two pieces together and tape them to the inside of the bag.	Make the horizontal strips. Make the vertical strips. Construct the seam. Start weaving. Cover what you've done with your horizontal strips. Add a strip along the longest edge. Make two strips the height of your bag. Trim down the edges. Tape the sides to the inside of your piece. Place a strip along the bottom of the side to the top edge of the purse. Cover all the edges with a strip of your primary color. Make the handle.
Some great fabrics to use would be satin, velvet, nylon, cotton, vinyl, or grosgrain. You can choose whichever material you like best.   Consider how stiff you want your bow to be when picking out the ribbon. If you want your bow to pop-up, use a firmer material like grosgrain or vinyl.; , There are many types of hair clips, ties and headbands available, and ribbon can be attached to almost all of them. All you will need to attach your ribbon to your hair accessory is a hot glue gun or fabric glue.  There are endless styles of bows to pick from, all ranging in level of difficulty. Decide if you want to make a bow that requires glue or stitching before you begin.          While bow making may seem challenging at first, with practice, it will become easier, and you can keep moving on to more challenging bows.	Select the fabric you would like to use for your bow. Decide how you want to fasten the ribbon in your hair. Choose the type of bow you want to make.
Generally speaking, one bottle of DyeMore can dye up to two pounds of fabric.Dyeing very light clothing or very dark clothing will require at least one additional bottle, so be prepared if this is the case for you. Polyester may require a second bottle of DyeMore, because of its synthetic makeup. The darker color you want at the end, the more dye you will need.; , This helps to remove finishes that might inhibit the absorption of the dye. Use warm, soapy water to wash.Use a sink or small tub for smaller items, such as scarves and short-sleeved shirts. Use a larger bucket or tub for bulkier items, such as long-sleeved shirts, jackets, and pants.  You can create different patterns, such as rosettes, sunbursts, swirls, and so forth. Here are some ideas to get you started:  For a simple, crumpled look, crumple your garment into a ball and secure it with a few, large rubber bands. For a banded effect, twist your garment into a rope, then tie some rubber bands around the rope. Keep the rubber bands several inches apart. To create a sunburst or swirl: pinch the center of your garment (such as shirt or handkerchief) and twist it. Keep twisting and turning the fabric until you get a shape like a cinnamon roll. Secure the garment by wrapping a few rubber bands around it.  Because of the challenge in dyeing polyester, using a stovetop method is recommended because the dye process needs hotter temperatures in order to work.Once the large pot is filled with 3 gallons (11.36 liters) of water, cover the pot and turn the burner to high. Heat the water to almost boiling. Using a cooking thermometer will be helpful, as the dye process requires a steady temperature of about 180°F (82.3°C). The thermometer will ensure that you keep the water at that temperature.  Shake the bottle of DyeMore before adding it to the pot to make sure that the dye is incorporated. In addition to the bottle of DyeMore, add 1 teaspoon of dish washing liquid and use a large spoon to stir the mixture well.If your fabric is white, and you want to dye it a lighter, pastel color, start with half a bottle of DyeMore. It is easier to add more dye later. If you plan on dyeing your fabric more than one color, pour in your lightest color first. You will need to do a separate dye bath for the other color(s).  This helps you to see if the dye is the shade you would like.If it is too light, then add some more dye to the mixture. You may need to add up to one more bottle. Test the color with a new scrap of white cotton fabric. If the color is too dark, then add more water. Then, test the color again with a new scrap of white cotton fabric. If you decide to add more dye, remember to shake the second bottle before pouring it in.  In order for the color to take fully in the clothing, polyester requires at least this amount of time in the dye bath. Use tongs to lift and move the clothing around in the pot. Wear rubber gloves to do this so that you do not dye your skin.   If you plan on dyeing all of your fabric, dip it all the way into the dye bath. It should be completely submerged. If you plan on dyeing only part of the fabric, then dip it in only part way. Consider draping the rest of the fabric over the edge of the container. Keep the garment in the dye bath even if it has reached your desired color in less than 30 minutes. The color can rinse from the fabric if it is not given enough time to set in the fabric, which will make it lighter than you desired.  Squeeze out excess dye over the pot full of the dye bath. Be sure to keep the rubber gloves on during this time, as the dye will still stain your skin. Remember that as the clothing dries, the shade of the color will lighten.If you wrapped rubber bands around your garment to tie dye it, carefully cut those rubber bands off with a pair of scissors., While you rinse, gradually make the water cooler. Continue to rinse the article of clothing until the water runs clear.If you want to add more colors to your garment, then you can dip it into another dye bath after you rinse it. Be sure to rinse your garment after each dye bath.  This will remove any last remnants of excess dye.  Spread an old towel out on the floor, and align the bottom of your garment with the bottom of the towel. Roll the garment and towel together into a tube. Press down on the towel tube gently and squeeze. Try to get out as much moisture as you can.  If you have a very large, bulky item, you may need to do this step a few more times with a fresh towel. Bulky items soak up more water than lightweight items.  Place the hanger in a place where there is a lot of airflow, such as on a balcony. If this is not possible for you, hang it in the bathroom and turn the fan on. Be sure to place some newspaper or old towels beneath the garment to catch any drips. There is a small change that the garment still have some dye in it.  Use a regular hanger to hang shirts and jackets. Use a pants hanger, or a hanger with clips, to hang pants, shirts, scarves, and handkerchiefs. Avoid draping the fabric over anything while it dries.	Weigh the garment to determine how much dye to use. Wash the garment prior to dyeing. Consider tying the garment up if you want to tie dye. Bring 3 gallons (11.36 liters) of water to boil in a large pot on your stovetop. Pour one bottle of DyeMore into the pot of water once it is simmering. Test the color on a scrap of white cotton fabric. Dip the garment into the dye bath.Stir the garment slowly and continuously in the dye bath for at least 30 minutes. Remove the garment from the dye bath when it reaches your desired color. Rinse the garment under warm water. Wash the garment again in warm, soapy water.Rinse the garment when you are done washing it. Wrap the garment in an old towel to remove excess moisture. Hang the garment to dry.
You want to make sure you behave in accordance to the law when you're pulled over for speeding. This way, your character will look good during trial and you're more likely to successfully avoid a speeding ticket.   Pull over as soon as you see the officer's lights and there is a safe spot to do so. You do not want to pull over in an intersection or anywhere else you might obstruct traffic. However, try not to wait more than 30 seconds to find a safe spot. Immediately put on your hazard lights to show you are respectful of the safety of other drivers on the road.Keep you hands visible as the officer approaches your car, placing both hands on the steering wheel. You do not want the officer to think you are being hostile or reaching for a weapon. When the officer asks for your license and registration, politely explain where these documents are and ask permission to reach for them.Show respect in your actions and words. No matter what happens, you must be polite and submissive. Do what the officer asks of you without arguing or getting defensive.; , If you're being pulled over for speeding, the first thing the officer will ask you is if you know how fast you were going. Be prepared to answer this question in a way that does not further your legal trouble.   When the officer asks you, "Do you know why I stopped you?", answer, "No, I don't." Answering that you were speeding can be taken as an admission of guilt and sabotage your chances of successfully fighting the ticket. If he asks how fast you were going, you do not have to answer the question. You have the right to remain silent. However, if you want to give some answer do not admit guilt here. Do not say, "I was going 62 in a 55 zone," for example. Instead, give a noncommittal answer like, "I'm not really sure." Now is not the time to fight your case. Do not say something like, "I wasn't speeding. I checked my speedometer." If you anger or otherwise frustrate the officer, he will probably remember you and be more likely to have specific memories and notations that can help the prosecution during trial. If the officer asks to search the vehicle, you have the right to refuse. A search warrant is required without probable cause. If the officer says he will get a search warrant, politely tell him to do so and continue to refuse a search.  While the officer is writing your citation, take advantage of this time to survey the scene.   Write down the make, model, license plate and unit number of the officer's car. Take note of your precise location and try to get an approximate sense of where the alleged violation took place. Take note of any weather conditions, such as rainfall or clouds, that could obscure the officer's judgment. Also, pay attention to the traffic conditions and look especially for extenuating circumstances that could have caused inadvertent speeding. If you have any passenger's, take note of their names and make sure they stay silent during the exchange. Write down anything the officer says. Note as many small details as possible. This will help you look like a credible witness in court. Pay attention to your shirt color, any small dents or cracks in your car, and any noticeable physical characteristics of the officer.  Once the officer returns to the car, he will hand you a citation to sign.   Remember, this is not an admission of guilt. It is merely an acknowledgment that you received the citation and understand you're receiving a speeding ticket. Politely ask the officer if he can move the court appearance to the county seat. If he refuses, ask him to note the request. Having the appearance moved closer will make fighting the ticket easier for you. Do not refuse to sign the citation. Once again, it's not an admission of guilt and refusing to sign it will not make you look favorable in the officer's eyes.  Wait for the officer to pull out before you leave the scene and do so in a calm, collected manner. You do not want to appear angry or otherwise confrontational while leaving the scene as anything that makes you more memorable to the officer can result poorly for you during trial.  When it comes to contesting a speeding ticket, you have a variety of options in terms of the route you take.   When you contest a ticket, you must enter a plea. Pleading guilty means you're accepting the ticket and paying the resulting fines, which will raise your insurance premiums. Pleading "No Contest" means you're not contending the charges but not pleading guilty either. This will, however, result in the same consequences as pleading guilty. Pleading "Guilty with explanation" means you admit to speeding but want to the court to take certain circumstances into consideration, which may result in your insurance premiums staying the same. However, the best way to avoid losing money over a speeding ticket is to simply plead "not guilty" and fight the ticket in court. You should only plead "guilty with explanation" if you were speeding due to an emergency.If you plead "not guilty," focus your defense on either challenging the officer's means of measuring your speed or his identification of your automobile. If there were many other cars similar to yours on the road that day, the officer may have pulled you over by mistake.Always check with your insurance before fighting a ticket. You want to see how much a conviction would affect your insurance premiums and whether the raise would be more or less than it would be if you simply accepted responsibility and paid the fine. Remember, only 50% of people who fight traffic tickets get their tickets dismissed.  Once you've entered a plea, it's time to set your court date so you know how long you have to prepare your case.   There are three ways to set your court date. You can appear before a judge and enter a Not Guilty plea as well as a request for a court date. You could go to the County Clerk's office and request a trial date. You could mail a copy of the citation to the courthouse, along with a request for a trial date. You usually have to post bail in the amount of the fine, so check with the court to make sure you have the proper amount and proper payment method. Posting bail means you've already paid your fine, so if you lose your case there will be no additional fees. Your trial will occur within 45 days of the day you enter you plea. As soon as you've entered your plea, begin preparing for trial. You probably do not need a lawyer for a speeding ticket. Lawyers are usually only brought into traffic court to fight violations that could result in jail time like DUI's and driving on a suspended license.  The first step to prepping for your defense is to make a trip to the Department of Motor Vehicles. You can get certain records at the DMV that can help you with your case.   You can verify the status of your driving record at the DMV. If you do not have previous traffic violations and have a clean driving record, bringing this kind of evidence to court can help your case. Someone at the DMV should be able to help you print your driving record for a small fee.  You should know your rights as a defendant while going into court. Rights are often glossed over in traffic court to try and speed through the process and get you to pay the ticket. Review your rights before the trial begins.   You have the right to a court trial with a judge. A jury will usually not be called in for traffic court. You do have a right to an attorney but, as previously discussed, this is probably not necessary when fighting a speeding ticket. You have the right to subpoena witnesses or documents. This is an important right to be aware of. If there's anyone who can verify you were not speeding, call them in to testify. Do not call the officer who pulled you over to testify, however, as he will want to see you pay the fine to keep his reputation intact. You have the right to cross-examine anyone who testifies against you, which usually means the officer who wrote the citation. You have the right to remain silent. In other words, you do not have to testify against yourself. You should probably avoid testifying against yourself while fighting a speeding ticket as it is unnecessary and could make you look bad.  While you wait for your trial, you should begin gathering evidence to support your case.   Go back to the scene of the citation. You should sketch a diagram of the scene that includes all roads, making the width of lanes, traffic controls like lights and signs, the location of your vehicle and the officer's vehicle when you were pulled over, any buildings, power lines, foliage, fences, or other notable features of the area. Submit a request for certain public records. You should review the actual vehicle code in the area where you were allegedly speeding to make sure the officer pulled you over for the correct violation. You can submit a discovery subpoena to the court to get certain documents that may help your case. You should get documents on the radar device used to determine your speed to check for any malfunctions or recent repairs. You should get a record on the police officer to look for any previous cases he's won or lost in traffic court. You should also get some information on the patrol car regarding any recent repairs or damages to the car.  If you have time, visit the court and watch the judge oversee a few cases. You want to see how the judge interacts with defendants to get a feel for his personality. You also want to see what his relationship is with the prosecutor and the testifying officer. This should give you a sense of how intense your trial will be.  Reviewing all the information you've gathered, pick a line of defense you feel will be most likely to help you win your case.   A lack of prosecution witness is an easy way to get a ticket dismissed. If the officer does not show, which happens sometimes, you will be found not guilty. Be prepared to use this as your defense if the officer is not present on your court date. If the prosecution fails to prove the case against you, you will be found not guilty. Knowing the code well, and having good witnesses and diagrams of the crime scene, can help you win your case this way. Technicalities can also help you get your ticket dismissed. If the officer was in the wrong jurisdiction or enforcing the wrong code for the area, for example, the judge would likely rule in your favor. You can also get the ticket dismissed by proving a factual error. For example, you could prove you were driving the proper speed or the radar reading was inaccurate.  When you enter the courtroom, you need to make a good impression on the judge. Choose an appropriate and professional looking outfit. Dress as if you were interviewing for a job. This will make you appear reliable and responsible.  Make sure you know the members of the courtroom on your trial day.   The defendant is you, as you're the person fighting charges. The prosecutor/ADA is the individual or team working on behalf of the state to prove your guilt. The judge is the person overseeing the case, who has final authority on the rulings. He will have a court clerk, who is his assistant. A bailiff will help conduct the ceremony of a trial. The police officer, if he shows up, will be the main witness of the prosecution.  The trial will begin with you stating your case. This is where you present the evidence you've gathered to show the judge why you believe your ticket should be dismissed. This can be a stressful procedure, so be sure to practice your opening statement several times before the trial date.  Once you've presented your defense, the prosecution will make their case against you.   The prosecution will strive to prove you're guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. To do so, the prosecutor will usually call up the officer who issued your citation and ask him a series of questions in an attempt to establish his reliability. Take notes during the prosecution so you can prepare your cross-examination. On one side of a sheet of paper, note what was said. On the other side, note your possible comments and questions to raise during cross-examination.  During the cross-examination, you have a chance to ask the witnesses brought by the prosecution a variety of questions. The goal is to undermine their authority and bring about reasonable doubts that you committed the violation.   Ask specifics. Making it appear that the witness does not remember facts correctly casts doubt in the judge's eyes. The details you wrote down earlier in terms of the incident you were pulled over will come in handy here. If the officer, for example, does not remember it was raining and a Tuesday he might not look like a less reliable witness. Ask questions you think might help your case. If, for example, you're trying to prove the officer pulled over the wrong car ask if he remembers that there were two other blue Honda Civics on the highway that morning. If you're trying to prove his radar system was faulty, ask if he was aware at the time of the citation his radar device was 3 weeks overdue for basic maintenance. Remember, you're not making any arguments during cross-examination. You're only asking questions.  Once the judge has heard both sides, he will make a ruling. He will either decide to dismiss the ticket or ask you to pay the fine.   If the judge rules against you, you can appeal the case to a higher court. However, an appeal is not a new trial with new witnesses. An appellate court will only look to see if any legal errors were made and whether these errors affected the final decision in the case.	Follow standard procedures when you're first pulled over. Answer the officer's questions appropriately. Gather information at the scene. Sign the citation. Leave the scene calmly. Learn your options for fighting the ticket. Set your court date. Visit the Department of Motor Vehicles. Review your rights. Gather evidence. Visit the court. Choose your defense. Choose appropriate attire. Familiarize yourself with the different members of court. Present your defense. Listen during the prosecution's case. Cross-examine the prosecution. Understand the judge's ruling.
You will need two different colors, one of the outside of the hat and one for the inside. Consider using cotton for one side and canvas or denim for the other.; , You will need to cut one circle out of each fabric. This will be the top of the hat.You will be using ½-inch (1.27-centimeter) seam allowances. If you have a very small head, you might want to cut a smaller circle. If you have a bigger head, you'll need to cut a bigger circle.  You will need two 12 by 3-inch (30.48 by 7.62-centimeter) rectangles for each fabric. You should have four rectangles total.If you want a taller hat, make the rectangles 4 inches (10.16 centimeters) wide instead. If you cut a bigger/smaller circle, then cut each rectangle so that it measures half of the circumference.  You will need four identical pieces total, two from each fabric. The pieces need to be 3½ inches (8.89 centimeters) wide. They need to be 12 inches (30.48 centimeters) long along the inner curve and 18 inches (45.72 centimeters) long around the outer curve.If you want a wider brim, cut the arches 4½ inches (11.43 centimeters) wide instead. If you cut a bigger/smaller circle, match the inner curve of the brim to the length of your adjusted rectangle.  If your fabric is thin, you might want to add interfacing. Cut the interfacing ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) smaller than your pieces, then iron them to the wrong side of the fabric. You only need to do this for the inner or the outer fabric pieces, not both. , Pin the two outer rectangles together, right sides touching. Sew up both of the narrow ends using a ½-inch (1.27-centimeter) seam allowance.Repeat this step for the two inner fabric pieces.  Pin the two outer brim pieces together, right sides facing in. Sew along just the narrow, straight ends. Use a ½-inch (1.27-centimeter) seam allowance.Repeat this step for the two inner fabric pieces.  Place one of the body pieces on the ironing board with the seam facing you. Use your iron to spread apart the seam. Press the seam open and flat. Repeat this step for all of the seams on all of the body and brim pieces.  Pin the top edge of the outer body piece to the outer edge of the matching circle. Make sure that the wrong sides are facing out. Sew around the edge using a ½-inch (1.27-centimeter) seam allowance.Repeat this step for the two inner fabric pieces.  Pin the inner edge of the matching brim all around the bottom edge of the body piece. Make sue that the wrong sides are facing out, then sew using a ½-inch (1.27-centimeter) seam allowance.Repeat this step for the two inner fabric pieces.  Turn one hat right side out; leave the other one as it is. Tuck the first hat into the second one so that the right sides are pressed together and the wrong sides are facing out., Sew using a ½-inch (1.27-centimeter) seam allowance. Leave a 4-inch (10.16-centimeter) wide gap for turning.Remove the pins as you sew.  Cut a notch every ¾ inch (1.91 centimeter) to the seam around the top of the hat. Cut a notch every inch (2.54 centimeters) to the seam around the outer edge of the brim. The notches need to be just under ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) so that they don't cut into the stitching.You don't need to cut notches into the seam between the body and brim pieces.  Shape the hat so that one piece is tucked into the other. If you need to, use a skewer or knitting needle to help push out the seams along the brim.  Tuck the edges of the gap in by ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) so that they match up with the rest of the brim. Press the brim flat with an iron when you are done., Sew ¼ to ½ inch (0.64 to 1.27 centimeters) away from the outer edge of the brim., You don't have to do this, but it will make your hat look more professional. Simply topstitching around the brim for 4 to 5 more rows. Leave a ¼ to ½ inch (0.64 to 1.27 centimeters) gap between each row., Again, if you don't have to do this, but it'll give you hair a nice touch. Topstitch around the top edge of the body part, ¼ inch (0.64 centimeter) away from the seam. Next, topstitch around the bottom edge of the body part, also ¼ inch (0.64 centimeter) away from the seam.	Choose your fabric. Cut two 8-inch (20.32-centimeter) circles. Cut the body pieces. Cut the brim pieces. Consider cutting some fusible interfacing. Pin and sew the rectangles together. Pin and sew the brim pieces together. Press the seams open on the body and brim pieces. Pin and sew the body pieces to the circles. Pin and sew the brim to the body. Tuck one hat into the other. Pin and sew around the outer edge of the brim. Cut notches into the seams to reduce bulk. Turn the hat inside out through the gap. Tuck and press the gap shut. Topstitch around the outer edge of the brim. Add more rows of topstitching to the brim. Topstitch the top and body of the hat, if desired.
There are several companies that compile and sell vehicle history reports. A vehicle history report is a comprehensive history that includes data on a vehicle’s manufacture, sales, and sometimes repair information. Try websites like:   Carfax Autocheck, After submitting your VIN, the third-party website may prompt you to pay a fee for a complete vehicle history report. While you may not want to pay, it is standard for companies to charge for this service.   Feel free to shop around. Different websites or companies may offer different prices. In addition, some companies may run promos on vehicle history reports at different times. Fees normally range from between $20 to $40 dollars to receive a full vehicle history report. Some websites may provide cheaper rates per report if you want several vehicle history reports. For example, you may be able to get 5 reports for $59.99., Once you get your report back, you’ll need to take a good look at it so you can get a good idea of the car’s history, options, and other information. When reading the report:   Verify the report matches the VIN you submitted. Read about the car's production and the vehicle's repair and registration history in the report. Look to see if the vehicle has been repaired or if the report shows any evidence of aftermarket upgrades.	Submit your VIN to a third-party website. Pay a fee. Examine the report.
If you cannot see out the back of the vehicle, you will need to use your side mirrors to see as you back up. Before you begin, adjust your side mirrors to ensure you can see the side of the vehicle, the ground, and anything coming up from behind you.In many cars you can adjust both mirrors from the driver’s seat, but in some you may need to adjust them manually by hand on each side.  Using mirrors will only show you what is behind your vehicle on either side, so it’s important to check both sides often. This will prevent you from accidentally hitting something, or from not noticing as someone approaches from one side or the other.You likely will need to drive even slower in reverse when using mirrors to be sure you don’t miss anything. It may help to pay closer attention to the mirror on a side with an obstacle, so you can keep your eyes on it.  If you are backing up using only your mirrors in a difficult area, you may choose to ask a friend to guide you. Using your mirrors to keep an eye on a friend that is checking your clearances from the back may be your best option when driving a box truck or something else with severely limited visibility.Have your friend stand behind the vehicle on one side to ensure you can see them as they guide you. Make sure to open your windows and turn off the radio to hear your friend’s instructions as you back up.	Check your mirrors before you begin. Check each mirror frequently. Enlist the help of a friend.
Driving a forklift is nothing like driving a car. Forklifts are steered by their rear wheels, have unwieldy weight distribution, and often have counter-intuitive controls. Depending on where you operate, you may need a license or specialized training.; , Look around the vehicle for any damage or malfunction that might prevent the forklift from operating as it is intended. Pay special attention to hydraulic mechanisms and tire conditions. This is very important!  , This can be done by reading the operator’s manual. ,,,, Move it through basic operations. There will be knobs and levers that move the forks up and down, steer the vehicle and control the speed.  Try lifting empty pallets or bags of sand to get used to the controls. Once you are comfortable, you can begin your intended chore.	Practice. Complete the pre-operations checklist. Familiarize yourself with all controls and meter readings. Note the size and shape of what you are lifting.  , Make sure the fork you are using is set to the proper width.  , Lift an object only to the height needed to move it, so as to balance the weight.  , Observe your working environment, make sure it’s clean and clear of obstacles.  , Start the forklift using the key and start button. Practice driving the forklift in an open area.
This plant grows well in zones 3 through 10. It is a reliable grower and has colorful blooms that usually last into fall. These plants are also great for attracting butterflies. Best of all, this plant is often the first to emerge in spring.   Varieties of this flower that bloom in the fall are perfect for attracting monarch butterflies and other migrating species of butterfly., This plant does well in zones 3 through 8. Although it does not bloom, its leaves offer silver and purple tones that look enchanting in the shade. This plant is a great way of filling out your garden and adding ground cover to it.Although a fern, this plant isn’t very aggressive or invasive. It’s just the thing if you want a tidy and orderly garden., This perennial is drought-resistant, making it a great choice if you have a busy schedule or have difficulty maintaining a regular watering schedule. It grows well in zones 5 through 11. The blooms are relatively tall, making this an excellent plant to use behind plants that grow lower to the ground.   The flowers of this plant will be an open invitation to hummingbirds and butterflies for the duration of the summer. At the end of its growing season, agastache develops seeds at the head of the plant. These often attract birds. Agastache comes in many different colors. You can buy varieties that come in orange, pink, red, purple, and blue., Although it has “weed” in its name, the brightly colored blooms of this plant, usually yellow or orange, will look right at home with other flowering perennials. It grows well in zones 3 to 9, and is ideal for a sunny spot in your garden.The first year butterfly weed is planted, it’s often stunted. This is completely normal. The following year, expect a much fuller plant. This plant is also resistant to drought. If your watering schedule is irregular or you leave home frequently for business, you won’t have to worry about this plant. As you might have suspected from its name, many species of butterflies love to visit this plant., This plant comes in annual and perennial versions. Two common perennial strains are referred to colloquially as “Moonbeam” and “Zagreb.” It flourishes in zones 3 through 9, does well in direct sunlight, and can survive dry conditions.   Traditionally, this plant offers blooms in shades of yellow. More recently, growers have come up with more colorful options. Look for this plant in orange, pink, and red in addition to yellow.	Enjoy early blooms with sedum. Add colorful leaves with a Japanese painted fern. Withstand dry conditions with agastache. Invite butterflies to your garden with butterfly weed. Minimize gardening responsibilities with coreopsis.
Those first ten or so minutes after it starts to rain can be the most dangerous. This is because when rain first begins to fall, it stirs up oil and other substances that have dried on the road. The mixture or oil and water forms a film on the road that makes it extra slippery.   During those first few minutes, drive more slowly and be on high alert for other drivers skidding. Heavy downpour over an extended period of time will eventually wash the roads clean, so conditions might be a little less dangerous at that point.; , The faster you’re going, the harder it is for your car to maintain traction in wet conditions. If your tires connect with a puddle of standing water, instead of maintaining contact with the road, they'll be more likely to skid. That's why it's important to slow down in wet conditions, even if visibility is fine.   It’s fine to go under the speed limit if the roads are wet. Don't go slower than the flow of traffic, but don't feel you have to go 70 mph (110 km/h) on the highway during a downpour. It’s especially important to go slowly if you see standing water.  These are the spots where you’ll be most likely to hydroplane, since your tires will have difficulty maintaining traction. They aren't always easy to see, so be extra cautious (and drive a little slower) when enough rain has fallen to start collecting in puddles.   Puddles are most likely to form along the sides of the road, so try to stay in the center of the lane.Try to drive in the tire tracks left by the cars in front of you. This decreases the chance that water will build up in front of your tires and cause you to lose control of your car. Make sure your windshield wipers are working properly. Poor visibility during rainfall leads to more accidents in part because it's difficult to see puddles through a wet windshield.  If you're driving on the highway and using cruise control, turn it off when it starts to rain. You’ll be more in tune with the conditions around you when it’s off. You may need to reduce your speed quickly, and that's easier to do when your foot is already on the brake and you're paying careful attention to the road conditions and your speed.  This enables you to maintain traction more easily and will prevent you from going too fast.While it's not necessarily possible to do if you're on a highway, if you're on a road with a lower speed limit driving in a lower gear can help you safely take treacherous turns or drive down hills without hydroplaning.  If you have to brake, do so in gentle pumps; if your car has anti-lock brakes, then you can brake normally. Make sure that you don't lock the wheels, which will throw your car into a skid.   Avoid sudden acceleration and braking. Don't make sudden turns, as these could throw your car off-course. Be extra cautious on curvy roads, taking care to steer smoothly and to drive slowly.  When you hydroplane, so much water has built up in your tires that they lose contact with the road. Your car will behave differently depending on how you've been driving and which tires are hydroplaning.   If your vehicle has been driving straight, it will most likely feel loose and begin veering in either direction. If the drive wheels hydroplane, there might be an increase in your speedometer and engine RPM (revolutions per minute) as your tires begin to spin. If the front wheels hydroplane, the car will start to slip towards the outside of the bend. If the back wheels hydroplane, the car's rear end will begin to veer sideways into a skid. If all four wheels hydroplane, the car will slide forward in a straight line, as though it were a large sled.  When you first start to skid, it can be panic-inducing. The car feels out of control and your impulse might be to do something rash. Try not to panic or lose your concentration. You just have to wait for the skid to stop, and stay alert so you can regain control of the car. No matter how your car reacts to hydroplaning, you can take the same steps to regain control.   Bear in mind that most hydroplane-related skids last for just a split second before your car regains traction. Waiting it out is the best way to handle the situation. Don’t slam on the brakes or yank the steering wheel, since these actions will cause you to further lose control of the vehicle.  Accelerating into a skid can cause you to lose control of the car and make matters worse. Don’t try to accelerate out of the skid; instead, slowly ease up, and wait a moment or to until you regain control before you accelerate again.   If you were braking when you entered the skid, ease up on the brake until it's over. If you’re driving a manual transmission car, disengage the clutch as well., Maintain a firm grip and carefully point the car in the right direction. This technique is known as "steering into the skid," and it's the best way to get your car back on track after skidding. You may need to correct the car’s course a few times with light counter-steering as you’re regaining traction.   Don’t turn too sharply or you’ll overcorrect. Jerking the wheel back and forth could cause the car to spin out of control. Keep a steady hand on the wheel and steer with small movements to correct your course.  Never slam on your brakes when you're hydroplaning, since it will make your car do unpredictable things. If you can wait until the skid is over to brake, that's ideal. If you need to break during the skid, pump your brakes gently until you regain contact with the road.   If you have anti-lock brakes, brake normally, since your car’s automated brakes will do the pumping for you.  Tires that are bald or have inadequate tread are unable to maintain good traction with the road, especially in slippery conditions.Having balding tires makes you much more prone to hydroplaning (as well as other tire-related problems like skidding on ice and getting flats). No matter where you live, you're sure to experience wet conditions every once in a while, so be prepared by making sure your tires are in good condition.   Worn tires are more prone to hydroplaning because they have shallow tread depth. A tire with treads that are worn halfway will hydroplane 3–4 mph (4.8–6.4 km/h) slower than fresh tires.A new tire has a tread depth of around 10/32", and over time this gets worn down. When it reaches 2/32", the tires are considered unsafe to drive on. You can determine whether your tires have enough tread by checking the wear bars. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards require tire manufacturers to make tires with wear bars to indicate how much tread is left. When the tread of the tire is even with the wear bars, it's time for new tires. Try the penny trick to see if you have enough tread.If you can't find the wear bars, stick a penny into the tire's tread with Lincoln's head pointing down. If you can see the top of his head, it's time for new tires. If part of his head is buried in the tread, you can wait to get new tires.  Tire rotation is an important way to save the treads on your tires. The type of car you have as well as your driving style can cause some tires to get worn out faster than others. Switching the tires to different wheels periodically prevents tires from wearing down too much on one side. Take your car to a mechanic or tire center and have the tires checked to see if they need to be rotated.   It's customary to rotate tires every 3,000 miles (4,800 km) or so. If you're not sure if your tires have ever been rotated, there's no harm in getting it done just in case. Front wheel drive vehicles need more frequent tire rotation, since this causes the front tires to wear out differently from the back tires., Underinflated tires can make you more likely to hydroplane, since they have more difficulty maintaining good traction with the road. They can also deflect inwards, which makes the tire center higher and traps water easier. Changes in temperature can cause the pressure in your tires to rise and fall, so it's important to check your tires regularly. Every few months, check the air pressure in your tires to make sure they're properly inflated.   Each car is a little different, so consult the owner's manual to find out exactly how your tires should be inflated. If necessary, inflate your tires according to the manufacturer's instructions.	Be careful during the first few minutes of rainfall. Slow down in wet conditions. Avoid driving through puddles and standing water. Turn off cruise control. Consider driving in a lower gear. Drive slowly and carefully to avoid skids, and maintain a mild pressure on your brake and gas. Understand what's happening when you skid. Stay calm and wait for the skid to stop. Ease your foot off the gas. Steer in the direction you want the car to go. Brake carefully. Make sure your tires have good tread. Rotate tires when necessary. Make sure your tires are inflated properly.
You may want to check out professional or amateur productions on video, but be careful not to get locked into preconceived notions of what a character should or shouldn't look or sound like.; , Be sure you have the talent sufficient to play all the most crucial roles. Don't even think about producing "Fiddler on the Roof" unless you have some men who could carry the load of Tevye. You might get lucky when someone appears from nowhere singing "If I Were a Rich Man" in a beautiful baritone, but don't count on it.  Intelligence is one of the actor's most important qualities. When in doubt, it's better to pick a smart person.  Do not base your casting on how well an auditioner can read aloud. Sometimes poor readers can act circles around good readers. Ask those who have difficulty reading to recite something from memory, even the alphabet, to get a sense of their emotive ability.  From the moment someone walks in, you can tell if they are a contender. Notice their manner of speaking, their body language, their attitude.  For example, you probably don't want to cast someone who is 5'4" to play Romeo to a Juliet who is 6'2". Then again, don't assume that things might not work!  , Quality of roles is better than quantity. It doesn't take much in some places to get an ensemble part, but large/leading roles show that the actor has ability.  Once you put someone in a role, he or she may become very attached to it. Better to delay the process with callbacks than to realize after a week of rehearsal that you've made a mistake.  You may want to select a cast and begin read-throughs before assigning specific roles. That way you can do script analysis and build cast camaraderie in the first few days while determining who fits which part best.  You need to know when he or she is available to rehearse. Also, make sure the actor will be in town during the run of the show!  , It should state what is expected of each cast member and include a tentative rehearsal schedule.	Know the script as well as possible before auditions. Identify a talent pool before even selecting a show. Look for smart people. Acting is not reading. Notice everything about the auditioner. Note physical qualities when casting characters, especially those who work in pairs, or when casting a child role. Look at credits, especially ones with bigger roles!, Take your time casting the show. Delay casting if necessary. Get a schedule from each prospective actor. Have actors sign a contract.

Its lines will serve as the walls of the house. These should be approximately even, but don't worry if they're not quite perfect.  Don’t make them taller than the walls, though, or your finished product will look somewhat unrealistic.  If you don’t see a house starting to emerge in your drawing, refer to the image here and make it look more like that.  Remember, we’re drawing in perspective--so for the door and window(s), add in smaller squares and rectangles inside the initial shapes for better detail.  There shouldn’t be too many, but whatever remains should be easy to get rid of.  Your house can follow whatever color scheme you'd like; if you're in need of inspiration, step outside for a few minutes and look at houses in your neighborhood.	Draw a cube. Draw two overlapping triangles on either side of the cube. Connect the sides of each triangle in order to form your roof. Add a large rectangle for the door, and a couple of squares or rectangles for windows. Outline the image and erase overlapping lines. Color it in and you’re done!
Being a perfectionist in your health goals may end up impeding your progress. If you try to be perfect in your new diet and eating habits, you may end up being so hard on yourself that you give up on the diet entirely. Instead, aim for moderate or small improvements in your diet and try to stick to them.; , You may want to re-evaluate your new diet if it is stopping you from living the kind of life you want to lead. If your new diet is stopping you from attending social events with friends and family, perhaps you should modify your dietary goals so that you can still have a social life., Cancelling a lot of social events with friends and family to get to the gym may be a sign of unhealthy exercise goals. The strength of social connections with friends and family is an important factor in your health. Make sure you aren’t sacrificing a healthy social life to get to the gym, since you need both social ties and an active lifestyle to be healthy., You should not aim to exercise so you can eat more brownies, chips or other junk food. An exercise plan built around compensating for poor eating habits will not make you healthier. Instead, you should focus on a well-rounded, healthy diet and a regular exercise routine., Ask your family doctor for advice on specific health goals that would be healthy for you.In conversation with your doctor, set specific and measurable health goals that are meaningful to you.   Ask your doctor: “I see a lot of people doing the vegetarian diet. Do you think this would work for me?” Inquire: “How much should I exercise each week if I want to lose weight by the summer?” For instance, if you want to be able to swim a certain distance by the summer, use this as a starting point for setting your goals. The goals you set should be specific and you should be able to measure your progress over time.	Aim for moderation rather than perfection. Consider whether your diet is negatively impacting your social life. Check whether you are routinely cancelling social events to exercise. Reflect on whether you view exercise as a form of compensation for poor eating. Get medical help if you are unsure about your health goals.
This is, obviously, the most important part of the outfit. As Rey lives on the harsh desert planet of Jakku, she does not own fancy clothing - it is basic and hardy. Rey's typical everyday outfit - the one we see her wear the most in the movie - consists of:  A grey/tan shirt that reaches to her upper thighs, a little way past her hips. It appears to be a cloth/rough cotton shirt with a v-shaped collar slit and no sleeves, so a long tank top. A pair of grey/tan cropped cargo trousers that cinch around her knees. Some grey/tan bandages or cloth strips that are wrapped around her arms or pulled over her arms. These protect Rey from the harsh heat and any danger she may encounter while scavenging. They are tight and stop right at the end of her wrists, stopping at the top a little under her armpits. A long flowing piece of white fabric that crosses over her shoulders and chest. The fabric is held in place by two brown leather belts that appear to be melded together at the hip. On one side of the bottom belt is a small brown pouch. A leather wrist cuff, and a pair of boots. The boots are actually a pair of Po Zu Piper V Dark Brown Boots, and are available on the Po Zu website. They are quite expensive, however, so any pair of sturdy ankle boots will do fine. Rey's other outfits are her scavenger gear, which makes a short appearance at the start of the movie. This outfit consists of all of the above items, except Rey wears a brown shawl/wrap of resilient fabric over her head and shoulders, along with a little pair of goggles. She also has her Resistance Base outfit, seen at the end of the movie, which is her shirt, arm guards, and pants, with a grey cloth waistcoat.; , Rey has short straight dark brown hair, styled in an interesting unique hairstyle of three small buns in a row down the back of her head. Her fringe is pulled back off her face and there are small wisps of hair floating down her face. If you are going to style your hair this way, there are many video tutorials on YouTube - just make sure to muss it up a little to keep it realistic. The makeup artists apparently tied the buns with brown wool to give them a rustic feel. You may have to tighten them from time to time, so it would be a good idea to utilize that pouch with bobby pins/hair grips and hair ties to tie the wool over., Camera flashes and con lights are very unforgiving and will highlight everything, from no matter how far away, so even simple base makeup is integral. In an Allure interview with the makeup artists for the movie, they stated that Daisy wore:  Tom Ford Traceless Foundation, By Terry Brightening CC Lumi-Serum in Sunny Flash, and M.A.C and Skin Illustrator pigments on her face. A dark brown eyeliner pencil from Bobbi Brown that was 'smudged and smudged', along with Kanebo Sensai 38C mascara, a mascara that is specially designed to last in extreme temperatures and can only be removed with 100F water. Daisy also had sunscreen on and the makeup artists sterilized sand in hot water before smearing it onto her face. Since Rey is obviously quite grimy and tanned, you may want to invest in some tanning lotion and also a makeup tutorial on how to create fake dirt on yourself.  Rey's eyes are a green-brown color, and normal contacts will do just fine., Rey is often seen with a serious-looking bo staff (you can choose a stick instead, or buy a staff online) or a blaster, given to her by Han Solo. The blaster is an easier choice for practicality, but the staff is much more iconic. You can always buy both, of course. She also wields Luke's/Anakin's lightsaber in the last part of the movie. The lightsaber was blue and is available online for cheap prices., For the movie, Daisy had an intense fitness regime and packed on a lot of muscle. This is a completely optional step and is up to you - just remember to whip into shape a while before the con if you're making a costume from scratch. This means that when you measure yourself up you'll be the correct body shape and won't have to worry about gaining/losing weight in between., If anyone wants photos with you, they'll be expecting Rey. Common poses are wielding the lightsaber/staff, firing the blaster, crossing your arms, or even just standing to the side while holding the staff. Look up stills of Rey online to get a good feel for everything, and make sure to do a run-through to check you can move okay in the costume. Your pose can also depend on the character you're posing with!	Get the costume. Style your hair (or wig!). Set your makeup. Buy contacts if you have to. Pick your weapons!, If you really want to take an extra step, work out. Figure out some poses.
If the toilet fails to empty completely, returns some contents to the bowl, or tends to clog after repeated heavy use, it's probably not flushing long enough.  The flush should continue for a second or so after the toilet contents disappear, to carry them over the bends and down, down and away., If it has been adjusted to not allow the tank to fill completely (to within an inch or so of the top of the overflow tube), adjust it up a bit.,  (The former are often added to save water, but not using enough water can require multiple flushes, cleaning, and general disgust and inefficiency - which you don't want to lead to the latter.),  A toilet flapper with a foam float halfway down is a simple, inexpensive, fairly effective way to make a low-flush toilet: the foam float on the chain, instead of a little cup under the flapper itself, holds the flapper up and open only long enough for the bottom half or so of the tank contents to flush it, with the weight of the top half on it to increase speed and power.  But, if the float is too high on the chain, the flush will cut off too soon to do its job.  Gently nudge the foam float down the chain a half-inch or so at a time until the flush lasts long enough.	Look for signs the flush is too short. Check the fill valve and float. Remove any objects, such as bricks, bottles, and booze, reducing the volume of the toilet tank. Check the float flapper.
One of the telltale signs of laryngitis is hoarseness, which refers to the raspy, strained quality your voice gets when you’ve used it too much.To make your voice sound raspy and gravelly, practice vibrating your vocal chords like you're croaking like a frog.Also practice making bah noises like you're a sheep, because this will also vibrate your vocal chords. After practicing making sounds, start incorporating that same raspy quality into your speaking voice.; , Another common thing that happens when you have laryngitis is that you'll experience unintentional changes in the volume and pitch of your voice as you speak.When you're speaking, try to make your voice crack as you say certain words, and then make your voice fade out briefly so it’s quieter than usual. Alternate between doing this and speaking in your regular (but hoarse) voice.  In addition to the voice cracking and fading, you should also whisper more when you speak if you want to fake losing your voice. When you have laryngitis, your vocal chords will often have trouble producing sound, and you can replicate this by dropping your voice to a strained whisper intermittently as you speak.   Make sure you continue alternating between your voice cracking, fading, whispering, and speaking hoarsely at a normal volume. When you transition between these different voice effects, try to make the transition as natural as possible so people don’t know you're forcing it.  Laryngitis often causes a rawness in the throat and a dry throat, so it’s common for people who’ve lost their voice to cough sometimes when they speak.Don’t cough too much, but throw in a few dry coughs if you’ve been talking for a while. A cough is created when your body forcefully expels air from the lungs, which is different from vibrating your vocal chords to create speech, meaning you can still cough if you’ve lost your voice., On top of performing different vocal effects to give the impression that you’ve lost your voice, there are also other things you can do to support your act. If you want to lay a foundation for your voice loss, complain of a sore or tickled throat and a cough one or two days prior to losing your voice.  Regardless of what causes laryngitis, the best remedy is always resting your voice.This means that if you really had lost your voice, you'd be trying to rest it so that you could recover quicker.   Try using your body language more, such as nodding or shaking your head, instead of talking when you're communicating with someone.  Laryngitis is often accompanied by a sore throat and coughing, and both these things can make it difficult and painful to speak. In conjunction with talking less and using your body language more, try writing things down to communicate instead of talking.   You can alternate between speaking with voice effects and writing (to rest your voice) to support the impression that you’ve got laryngitis.  Another effective remedy for laryngitis is drinking lots of fluids, particularly water.To support your act, drink lots of water. Especially if you have to talk for an extended period, take small and frequent sips of water.  Soothing lozenges and cough drops are common when people have lost their voice, so you can do the same to support the idea of your laryngitis.	Sound hoarse. Make your voice crack and fade. Throw in some strained whispering when you speak. Cough when you talk. Complain about symptoms in the days leading up to your voice loss. Talk less than you normally would. Write things down to communicate. Drink a lot of water. Suck on throat lozenges.

Begin by visiting http://www.aaa.com. The AAA is actually made up of many organizations, serving different areas. However, you can reach any of these regional organizations by visiting this website.    Note: start with this step even if you plan to apply for membership in person, not online.; , The AAA website may automatically detect the general area you are located in, and send you to the correct web page for your area. If it does not, it will likely display a popup box and prompt you to enter your zip code.   If you do not know your zip code, you may look it up by entering your address at the US Postal Service website.  Some local AAA organizations display their regional address prominently on the front page of their website, which you were just directed to. If you do not see one, or if the address is not nearby, look for a "Find another office" link, or "Find a local branch," or similar. Click this link to be taken to a map or a list of all AAA offices in your region, including their phone numbers and hours of operation.   Try using your browser's Find command and enter "Office" or "Branch." This is typically available with the Ctrl+F key combination in a Windows operating system, or command+F on a Mac.  Optionally, call the listed phone number and ask for information on membership plans. Your local office may or may not be able to register you as a member over the phone. Almost any AAA office should be able to register you in person, as long as you bring your driver's license and a method of payment.   To save time before you show up, know what type of vehicles you operate, and whether other members of your household wish to apply as well.  There are dozens of regional websites, organized in many different layouts. Somewhere on the homepage, however, there should be a button or text link labeled Join Now or Join AAA.  When you click Join, you will likely be taken to a chart comparing the benefits of different membership plans. The details of these vary between regional organizations, but the benefits are typically laid out clearly in a chart.   Usually, the organization offers Classic (or Basic), Plus, and Premier membership. The Plus and Premier memberships cost more, but come with additional perks as described, such as additional free towing, or free travel insurance under certain conditions. If you do not understand a particular perk, the name of the perk may be a link that describes it in more detail. Other AAA websites have a question mark to click next to it, or a "View details" link at the bottom of the chart.  The "Primary Member" price indicates how much you would pay each year for that membership. There is typically an additional "Enrollment" fee or "New Member" fee, which is an additional charge applied once, when you join. Finally, if you wish another member of your household to receive the same benefits, that may cost you an additional "Associate Member" fee each year, per additional member.  The Classic or Basic plan typically only covers ordinary cars, not RVs, trailers, or motorcycles. Your regional organization may display detailed information on this in a Vehicle Types chart at the bottom of the page, or include it somewhere in the perk list.  After selecting "Join" for a particular plan, you should be taken to a form. Enter your full name, personal information, and contact information, as directed. When you're done, hit next.  You may be prompted for additional information, such as associate member information. Look for a "Convenience Billing" option. Select "No" if you do not want your credit card to be automatically billed at the end of each year. Keep it selected "Yes" if you want to automatically renew your membership each year.   If you disable convenience billing, you will need to manually pay your membership dues each year to retain membership benefits.  Enter your credit card information, or your personal checking account information. After confirming the order via email, your membership card should arrive in the mail within a few days.   Do not enter your credit card information over an unsecured internet network, especially a public one used by many people.	Visit the American Automobile Association website.

The cucumbers can be spaced 1 foot apart from one another, in rows that are spaced directly beneath the bottom netting bars.  You may need to wind them around a few times before they stay in place.  In doing so, you train your cucumbers to grow upward and naturally climb onto the trellis. After your vines have grow a foot or so in length, they will likely begin the climb the trellis without additional training, but you should monitor their progress throughout the growing season nonetheless.	Plant your cucumbers below the trellis. Once vines form, wrap the tendrils around the bottom of the clothesline. Continue winding the vines around the clothesline as they grow.
If you live near a beach, take a walk and collect some pretty small shells. If you don't have a beach close by, look in craft stores or online for small shell collections. You'll also need a matchbox or two.; ,, The color can match the shells or be in contrast with them.   Don't glue the paper or cloth over the matchbox drawer. You need to be able to access this still. Instead, cut out small pieces of paper or cloth the exact size of the drawer ends and glue at each end separately.  You can add shells to just one surface, or to the top and sides, or all over. You can create a pattern, or simply add the shells randomly.  Glue each shell to the top (and any other part of the box). Leave to dry before gluing shells to additional sides or the base of the box.  These could be beads, costume gems, glitter, lace, ribbon, bows, etc. Decide whether these will form part of the pattern or will be additional decorative elements on top.  It's useful for keeping pins and needles in a sewing basket, paperclips on a desk, earrings/rings, etc. on a dressing table and tacks in the kitchen, etc.	Search for lovely tiny seashells. Peel the striking edges off the sides of the matchbox.  , Cover the matchbox with plain paper or cloth. Design a pattern for adding the shells to the box. Use a glue brush to paint glue over the paper or fabric. If adding other decorative elements, add now. Use the box.
There are a few different options for steel-bound strings. You’ll need to determine which gauge string you use and what type of finish you prefer. The standard size for strings is .11 or .12, but you could go higher for lighter strings or lowers for heavier strings. Decide what type of finish from the following types:          Bronze strings have a clear, ringing, and bright tone, but age quicker. Phosphor bronze strings are warmer and darker than bronze strings. The sound is crisp and lasts a long time due to the phosphor finish. Brass strings have a bright, jangly, and metallic texture. Polymer-coated strings have less sustain and brightness, but are warm sounding and resistant to corrosion. Silk and steel strings are popular among folk guitarist and finger picking players due to their softer touch and delicate tone.; , Lay your guitar on a flat surface, for example on a table, and put yourself in front of your guitar. You could also lay it across your lap or even hold the neck while the body stands upright on the ground.  Begin by removing the deep E or the 6th string which is the thickest string on the guitar. Start unwinding your string by turning the tuning peg to loosen the string. You can figure out which direction to turn the peg by plucking the string and turn it one direction. If it gives off a higher note that means you are tightening the string.          Keep turning the peg until the string falls off the guitar. If the strings are very old then consider just cutting them off with a wire cutter. Remove each string moving from the thickest to thinnest.  Now the string should be hanging from the bridge of the guitar. The bridge is underneath the sound hole where the guitar strings are attached. Depending on what type of bridge your guitar has, you may need to remove the bridge pin. If your guitar doesn’t have bride pins, you should be able to wedge the strings out of their socket.          Pull the pin to remove it. If you can’t wedge it out, use pliers. Bridge pin pullers are available for about $5.00 and are a nice accessory. Pull the string out of the hole., Open the package and uncoil the first string (the thinnest high E string). Look for the string labeled 6th string and uncoil it. Each brand of strings use different legends to help users identify which string is which.  Isolate the lightest string from your new pack. Place it through the bridge's hole that is farthest to the right of the guitar. Begin pulling the string with slight pressure. Thread the new string until the end of the string falls into place. Now place it in the groove on the bridge of the guitar.         If your guitar has bridge pins, you'll need to remove them before inserting the new string. The best way to remove the pins is by using a bridge pin puller. Lodge the tool into the pin and rock it from side to side until the pin becomes loose. Wait until you've fully thread your new string into place before reinserting the pin.  To attach it to the head, begin by lightly pulling the string up the neck. Bring the string an inch above the tuning peg. Wrap the string around the peg twice and insert the string into the hole between the two loops you created.          Begin tightening the string, but don’t tighten the string too much. While tightening the string, use your other hand to stretch the loose string so it holds tune quicker., Take time to do this process to each thicker string. Never fully tighten a string until every string is attached to the guitar. Use a tuner once every string is attached and tune to the following tuning: EADGBE.          Wait a few days to cut the excess string.	Buy a set of strings. Position your guitar. Remove the current strings. Remove the strings from the bridge. Prepare your new strings. Begin stringing. Attach the string to the tuning peg. Repeat for the rest of the strings.
Mark your calendar, or just check the fluids frequently. ,, The oil should be checked after the car cools down for an hour or so, so that oil in the return galleries, cylinder head valleys, etc. is drained down so you don't get a false reading. Locate the oil dipstick (use the owner's manual). Hook a finger through the loop and pull the dipstick all the way out, releasing any clips that might be holding it in place. Use a paper towel or rag to wipe the dipstick clean so that you will have a clear reading. Insert the dipstick into its opening and push it firmly all the way back, as far in as it will go. Pull it out all the way, this time reading the oil level. When you are done, replace the dipstick in its opening.  The dipstick has markings on it indicating a range for acceptable oil level (usually notched, dimpled, or scribed). Double check the markings you see against the owner's manual. If the oil level is too low, appropriate motor oil must be added before the car can be driven. With a new car, take it to the dealer's service or parts department; have them show you how to add oil, and buy the oil and funnel their mechanics use. With an older car, take it to an auto parts store; they will walk to your car, show you where to add oil, and recommend what to buy. Since some engines consume more oil than others, adding oil can also become a frequent task.      Look at the color of your oil, too. Clean engine oil is a clear, golden color. Dirty engine oil is black or brown. If yours is dark, have a look at your car's records to see when the oil was last changed. Darker engine oil can still run a car just fine, so go by the schedule more than by the color. You should also change engine oil according to both mileage and time. Consult your owner's manual for the proper intervals. Even if you don't drive the recommended number of miles, plan to change your oil about once every six months. Just sitting in the driveway, your car's oil can break down and become less effective. Change your oil more frequently than the recommended schedule if your car gets severe use. Repeated, pronounced loss of engine oil can indicate a leak in a gasket or that your car is consuming oil. Keep a watchful eye on your driveway where you park. Also look for signs of oil leaks on the outsides of the engine, and if you see any oil or consistently consume oil, take your car to a mechanic and explain what you have seen. If the oil looks milky or foamy, it may be contaminated with coolant, and should be checked by a mechanic. This condition could indicate a blown head gasket or other serious problems.  This is usually done with the engine running and fully warmed up, either in neutral or park, depending on the make and model. It will be the second of two dipsticks. As with the oil, locate it, pull it out (releasing any clips), wipe it off, push it all the way back in to the bottom of its travel, then pull it out and read the level. Again, look for a level between the two marks on the dipstick.  This transmission fluid is reddish. Transmission fluid does not need to be changed as frequently as oil, but it does occasionally need to be changed. The interval may be as much as 100,000 miles (160,000 km) in newer cars; consult your manual to be sure. If yours looks brown, black, or burnt, or its appearance suggests that it didn't come out of a bottle lately, consider replacing it. Transmission fluid lubricates the transmission, your car's gear system.  Consult your manual for the location, or look around for a plastic reservoir such as this one labeled brake fluid. If your reservoir looks like this one, you can read the level of fluid right through the plastic. Wipe dirt off the outside, if you need to. It might help also to jostle the car gently on its suspension with your hip, hands, or knee, so that the fluid level jiggles a bit. If you still can't see it, take the cap off and look in.  Cars should not consume brake fluid. Low brake fluid can indicate either a leak in the brake line or worn brake surfaces. If your brake fluid is low, have the car checked to find out why. A car with low brake fluid or leaking brake fluid could fail to stop.  This will generally also be a plastic reservoir. Read it through the walls, as you did with the brake fluid, by opening the lid and pouring in more of an appropriate power steering fluid. There may be two pairs of lines, one for a hot engine and one for a cold engine. Read the one that is appropriate to the current condition of your car.  Some cars are now equipped with electronic power steering and will not have a reservoir.  Be sure the engine has cooled down, otherwise scalding water could spray out as you open the reservoir! The coolant will most likely be in a reservoir up front, near the radiator.  Cars are designed to operate with antifreeze as coolant, not water. Antifreeze is a mixture that has a lower freezing point and generally, a higher boiling point than water. If you must replenish your coolant, go buy a bottle of the correct stuff. Read the label on antifreeze. Some formulations are intended to be mixed half and half with water; others should be poured in at full strength. The antifreeze label will tell you which type you have. Sometimes there can be coolant in the reservoir but no coolant in the radiator. If the car is running hot and there is coolant in the reservoir, then you need to remove the radiator hose to check for fluid in the radiator.   Wiper fluid won't affect the performance of your car, but this is what comes out when you use the sprayers to clean your windshield while driving. Washer fluid that's formulated to clean off bugs and other road grime is inexpensive, so it's worth getting the real thing, though topping off with a little water will do in a pinch. There is generally no harm in having low washer fluid. You will naturally use this up as you drive your car and clean the windshield. Simply refill it before it gets completely empty. If you are expecting very cold weather, be sure to use washer fluid that won't freeze in low temperature. Wiper fluid with a low freezing point is specially marked as such.  It's not one of the fluids under the hood, but it is essential to the efficiency and safety of your car. You should check your tires even more often than your engine fluids. While you're there, check the tread on your tires.	Your owner's manual tells you when fluids must be checked, but this is just the minimum to keep your warranty in effect. Park the car on a flat, level surface and set the parking brake. , Open the hood. , Check the motor oil. Check the transmission fluid. Check the brake fluid. Check the power steering fluid. Check the coolant. Check the windshield washer fluid. Check your tire pressure.
Combine 1 ½ cups (355.5 g)  of citric acid, 1 ½ cups (355.5 g) of washing soda, ½ cup (209 g) of baking soda, and ½ cup (130 g) of sea salt in a large bowl or pot. Stir the mixture so all of the ingredients are well combined.If you don’t have sea salt, you can substitute kosher salt.  When the detergent ingredients are fully mixed, carefully transfer it to a jar or other container. Make sure to choose a container with an airtight lid because the borax-free detergent is especially prone to clumping when exposed to high humidity.If you live in an area with high humidity, place 2 tablespoons (30 g) of powdered bentonite clay inside a piece of cheesecloth or pantyhose. Secure the fabric so the clay won’t spill out, and throw the packaged clay into your container of detergent. The clay will absorb the excess moisture so the detergent doesn’t clump.  When you need to wash a load of dishes, place 1 tablespoon (15 g) of the detergent mixture in the dishwasher’s detergent cup. Set the dishwasher as you normally would, and allow the cycle to run.	Mix the citric acid, washing soda, baking soda, and sea salt. Place the mixture in a jar. Use the detergent mixture as you would premade detergent.
Stitch a 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) seam.  If there are problems, these could be the reasons why:   The seam is too short: allow a bit more fabric to show past the foot as you work it through the machine The seam is too large: if you aren't feeding the fabric into the machine carefully enough, it can be helpful to make a guide marker 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) from the needle. You can do this using a dab of liquid paper or a bit of masking tape. The guide on the machine might be causing the seam allowance to come down too much as you sew; if so, use your own sense of guidance instead.	Check the accuracy of the foot:   Cut two 6 inch (15.2 cm) squares using a rotary cutter. Check this seam against a ruler or tape measure.
You can also paint some white cardstock using red, brown, or orange paint. This will give you a streaked, fur-like texture.   If you can't find cardstock, you can also use construction paper. Cardstock will simply give you more support. If you already have a mask at home that fits you, you can trace it onto the cardstock, cut it out, then skip to the next section.; , Place the paper widthwise across your face, from temple to temple. Gently feel where your eyes are through the paper. Lightly mark the spots on the paper with a pen or pencil, then lift the paper away.  Set the paper down on a flat surface. Draw two almond shapes where your made the eye marks. Next, draw a basic mask shape around the eyes. The mask will cover the forehead, eyes, and part of the nose bridge. It should look a little like a peanut or jellybean.   You can look up a template online, use an existing mask, or freehand it.  Start with the outside shape first. Next, poke a hole in each eye, then cut the eyes out. If you want the mask to be more symmetrical, fold the paper in half first, then cut along one of the lines that you drew. When you unfold the mask, it will be symmetrical ., Cut a piece of thin elastic. Tie a knot in each end. Staple each end of the elastic to each side of the mask. Make sure that the knot is inside the mask so that it holds. If you can't find thin elastic, do the following:   Punch a hole and each side of the mask. Cut two long pieces of ribbon. Tie a ribbon to each hole. Use the ribbons to tie the mask on the back of your head.  Use the same type of paper as you did for the mask body. You will be cutting both ears out at the same time.   If you decide to use painted paper, make sure that you paint both sides.  Rotate the paper so that the folded edge is on the side. Cut out a large triangle that is almost the same height and width as the paper. This will give you some extra-large ears.   You can cut smaller ears if you prefer.  Hold the ears together and cut them at the same time. Separate the ears when you are done. Your ears will have two flaps at the bottom., Take your first ear. Pull the left flap over the right flap until the ear curves. Secure the flaps with a glue stick.Repeat this step for the other ear.  Take your first ear. Coat the overlapped flaps with glue. Slide the ear behind the top corner of the mask. Run your finger across the mask to seal the mask against the flaps.The ear will sort of flop forward.   Repeat this step with the other ear.  Take a look at you mask. If the flaps are covering part of the eye hole, trim them away with a pair of scissors., Hold the paper widthwise, then roll it into a narrow cone. You want the tip to be about ½ to 1 inch (1.27 to 2.54 centimeters) wide. You want the base to be a few inches/centimeters across. Secure the cone with tape or glue.   The paper needs to be the same type that you used for your ears and mask body.  Flatten the cone so that it has two folded edges. Open the cone up and flatten it the other way. When you open the cone up again, the openings at the base and tip should be shaped like squares., Cut a 2 to 3-inch (5.08 to 7.63-centimeter) slit into each folded edge. Only do this on the wider end of the cone, not the narrower one. You will be turning these into flaps so that you can attach the muzzle., Fold all flaps down towards the outside of the cone. Use the slits you cut as a guide. Choose a side to be the underside of the muzzle, then cut that flap off.  Position the muzzle so that bridge of the nose is just below the eyes. Once you are happy with the position, secure the flaps with glue. Part of the muzzle will be hanging below the mask body.  If there are any flaps covering the eyes, be sure to cut those away too.  This is not absolutely necessary, but it can give your mask a nice touch. Tear short strips of red, brown, or orange paper. They need to be about ¼ to ½ inch (064 to 1.27 centimeters) wide and about 1 inch long. Curl them around a pen or pencil, then glue them around the edges of the mask.You can use just one row, or add more rows until you reach the eyes.  Cut two circles out of tissue paper. Fold them in half, and cut a short fringe into the curved edge. Glue each folded circle to the bottom of each ear. Use a dab of glue to keep the circles flat.If you don't have white tissue paper, a plain tissue or coffee filter will also work. Alternatively, you can paint the inside of the ears white instead. Consider adding some black to the tips of the ears. You can do this by lightly shading them in with crayon, pencil, or paint.  There are a few ways you can do this. The simplest way would be to paint the area around the eyes using white paint. You can also tear more short, thin trips out of white paper, then glue them around the eyes for a feathery look.You can use regular white paper or tissue paper for this. Consider outlining the eye holes with black marker to make them more expressive.  Use white acrylic paint and a paintbrush to apply some paint to the sides and underside of the muzzle. Extend the paint up the angled side flaps.  Run some hot glue around the inside edge of the narrow opening at the top of your cone. Quickly press a small, black pompom into the opening.   Match the pompom to the opening size. If the opening is around ½ inch (1.27 centimeters), then use a ½ inch (1.27 centimeter) pompom. Alternatively, you can cover the opening with two strips of masking tape, then color the tape black with a permanent marker or acrylic paint.,	Get a sheet of red, brown, or orange cardstock. Figure out where your eyes will go. Refine the mask shape. Cut the mask out. Attach some elastic so that you can wear the mask. Fold a sheet of red, orange, or paper in half widthwise. Cut a large triangle out. Cut a 2-inch (5.08-cenitmeter) slit in the bottom-center of each ear. Overlap the flaps to curve the ears, then secure them with glue. Glue the ears to the back of the mask. Trim away the excess flap, if necessary. Roll a sheet of red, brown, or orange paper into a narrow cone. Shape the cone into a pyramid. Cut four slits into the bottom edge of the cone. Fold three of the flaps and cut the forth one off. Secure the muzzle to the bottom of the mask. Trim off the excess flaps hanging over the edges of the mask. Give the mask a furred texture with torn strips of paper. Add some ear tufts using white tissue paper. Add some white around the eyes. Paint the sides and bottom of the muzzle white. Hot glue a small, black pompom into the nose opening. Finished.
The goal of a song is to express an idea. This could be very simplistic or complicated, but it has to come from somewhere, and mean something to you. Some of the best places people seek inspiration are at coffee shops, where lovers and/or friends meet up, talk, kiss, and interact. Other songwriters like going out into the woods where they can hear the birds chirping, and experience the awesome solemnity of nature.Look for a place which suits your needs. If you need interaction, go to a crowded place. If you need silence, take a drive or sit by the lake. Spend some time using all of your sensory abilities. Look to see the colors around you, listen to the sounds you hear, feel the table in front of you, and smell the multitude of aromas. The ideas you come up with don't necessarily have to be serious or intricate. Especially when it comes to pop songs, short, sweet, and upbeat thoughts are especially welcome.; , Grab a sheet of paper and a pencil/pen when you go to seek your inspiration. Every time you hear, touch, smell, or see something interesting, write a word or two down which represents it. For example, I hear a bird calling in the woods so I write down "feather, echo, call, hear me." Compile a large list of these as you travel to different locations and seek inspiration from elsewhere.Carry a small 2X4 inch journal in your pocket when you travel. This way you will have a way to keep your ideas contained together, and always have something to write an idea down on. Put stars around, or underline words which weigh on you heavily. These might be words you want to focus on when you later write your song.  You do not want to write a song about love, death, depression, working, dreams, and learning who you are. One of those works just fine, and will help to focus the minds of your listeners later on. Take your random word lists, and begin to cross certain words off. Begin a permanent list on another piece of paper.Each of these important words should center on one topic. For example, "gravel, breeze, going home, rough road, time, open space" would center around the concept of "taking your own path in life." Begin to connect and number the words in the order you want them in your song. Using the previous example, "1. open space, 2. breeze, 3. rough road, 4. going home." You need some open space so you go on a car ride. During the car ride you experience the breeze of the outside air. However, you begin to feel how rough the road is, so you decide to make your way back home. It is important that the topic you choose is relatable to everyone. Since this will be a pop song, it is going to be popular to a wide range of audiences. For example, topics like sadness or longing might be more relatable to a general audience than depression.  Every topic has already been sung about, whether it be love, sadness, happiness, longing, hope, trustworthiness, etc. The key is to either say something new about it, or say it in a different way. This is where the use of metaphor really comes in handy. The descriptions you pick up on can be transformed into a highly engaging topic about an old conversation.For example, you might notice the way a bird's feathers flutter in the wind. You can then use this detail as a metaphor for the way your life is going, i.e. up and down. Rather than just explicitly saying "up and down" you use a metaphor that explains your thinking. Paint a picture with these metaphors. Do not string a whole bunch of them together randomly. For instance, if you are using the bird metaphor, stick with the bird. Talk about the way it dives, eats, sleeps, breathes, etc. That vivid imagery will capture the imaginations of your song listeners.  Don't worry about rhyming yet, as much as writing your lyrics in complete sentences. Take your important words and build around them with active verbs, adjectives, etc. Write your lyrics as if you were writing a movie script. Tell a story using "you" more than you use "I."The basic structure of a pop song goes: verse, pre-chorus, chorus, verse, chorus, interlude, chorus. There are two sets of verses where you can really get into telling your story. The first verse will introduce your listener to the story. The second verse can either repeat the same sentiment of the first verse, or change the direction of your story. The chorus has to be the same every time you sing it in order for the listener to latch on to the song. This part of the song should clearly represent the main idea you are driving at. If your song is about going home, tell the listener you are going home, either manifestly (I'm going home) or latently (I'm going back to the place where it began). Remember, some part of the chorus will likely become the title of your song.  Before you begin tweaking/altering your lyrics, you will want to figure out the general beat of your song. The rhythm will tell your listeners, even without words, the mood of your song. For songs about sadness, or longing, the rhythm is usually slower, while happy songs are generally more upbeat.Above each word, write full, half, or quarter notes. This will let you know how long you want to sing each word. Sad songs have a lot more full notes, while happy songs are generally full of quarter, and sometimes even eighth notes. The chorus, of either a sad or happy pop song, will have a consistent rhythm throughout the song. When it comes to verses, sad songs have a more freewheeling style. They can go slower or faster, and change up in between. Happy songs should have both consistent chorus lines and verses respectively throughout.  This is probably the most important part of a pop song. Pop songs are played on a radio, and therefore, there is a short time to "hook" the audience. The hook of your song draws them in and keeps them interested. Sit down at a piano, or pull out your guitar. Begin practicing different riffs. Alternate the riff to suit your particular song.One of the best examples of a riff is "Satisfaction" by the Rolling Stones. The entry to this song immediately gets the audience hooked. Note that the riff does not necessarily have to be the same as the melody or rhythm. The hook can be used solely at the beginning to draw the audience in, or it can be used throughout and remain in the background. A song like "Satisfaction" uses the riff throughout, while a song like "Train, Train" by Blackfoot only uses a harmonica riff at the very beginning.  There is no perfect formula for this as there is a different melody for every song ever made. However, pop songs generally hand a mixture of repetition and variation that make the song easy to remember. Read the words of your song out loud, over and over again, until your mind begins to attach some notes to the words.One way to find inspiration for a melody is to listen to other pop songs. You might find a melody someone else used, and create a variation on it. After you have figured out a melody for the first line of a verse, apply it to the second as well. Change the melody for the third line, and then come back to the original melody for the fourth. This is a common pattern in pop songs which creates a level of repetition that a general audience likes (1, 1, 2, 1). Remember that melodies will change when you transition from verses to chorus lines. Pop songs have strong chorus melodies which allow the singer to belt out and become emotional (either happy or sad). Have the peak notes of your song fall within the chorus, such as extreme high notes and/or long notes.  Pop songs generally use 3 or 4 note chord progressions. Type into Google the name of any song followed by the word "chord" and it will tell you what chords were used. For example, the song "Firework" by Katy Perry has the following chord progression: | G | Am | Em | C | Chord progressions for pop songs, like in "Firework" are repeated for the verse, pre-chorus, and chorus.You can use chord progressions from other songs, just not lyrics or melodies. However, feel free to add or change one of the notes to suit your song best. If you repeat a chord progression, change the scale you play it in. This creates some level of variation between the verse, pre-chorus, and chorus. For example, "Firework" has a steady low chord progression for the first verse. The pre-chorus ranges from low to high, and the chorus is a steady high chorus progression. Once you have figured out what chords you would like, you can go back and attach it to the rhythm and melody. You may want to add/delete words in your lyrics as join together the rhythm, melody, and chords.  This usually comes after you sing the chorus a second time, and before the third time. It could be a guitar solo or a piano solo. The singer might want to belt out long notes with various modulations in their voice. This interlude should flow naturally from the song, rather than being an interjection.For example, you can build on notes in chorus lines. The first time you sing the chorus, sing notes relatively short. The second time, sing them longer, stretching them out. You can then go straight into a bridge which allows you to sing the same notes for as long as you want. Mix it up. A lot of pop songs might start an interlude with long, belted notes and then transition into a piano or guitar solo. The options are nearly endless. Reel the interlude back in so that you can end the song. Remember, you want distinguished lines between the different sections.  A common way to end a pop song is to simply repeat the chorus line over and over again as the song fades away. Many Aerosmith songs such as "Love in an Elevator" use this fading action a lot. It is best used for loud, rhythmic, hard edged chorus lines. Other, more sad songs might end better coming back to your original starting point. If you started off slow and soft, bring it back there, to effectively "close" your story.You can also end your song on an instrumental, however, this is usually an artistic license allotted to bands which already have names for themselves. For example, the ending to Lynyrd Skynyrd's "Freebird" is over five minutes worth of instrumentals. However, you can play your basic riff a couple of times at the end of your song, just begging your audience to repeat and play again.  After you have finished adding the music to your lyrics, you will want to go back and add your rhymes in. In modern day pop songs, there is more "free-styling" when it comes to lyrics but there is still a basic rhyme format. The trick of the pop song is to make it easy to remember, and rhymes facilitate that.Type a word into Google and add "rhymes with" next to it. A list of words will pop up and help you decide on which word best fits. Depending on the particular word choices you may have to go back and change some of the melody/rhythm. This is a back and forth, give and take process.  Use the strengths of the people around you to help make your song better. Find out whether a person you know plays an instrument. For example, if you are doing a very upbeat pop song, you might want someone who knows how to play a trumpet, or someone who is a good DJ.Other friends or family might be able to lend their voices to your effort, and harmonize with your melody. You might also want to ask around for anybody that has an "in" into the music business. Someone who has already recorded an album, or who has worked with a record company, might be able to get your song some radio air time.  Record it on your computer or stereo. Listen back and see if you can follow it. The words should sound crisp and clear as they will be memorized by millions of pop song listeners. There should be clear, distinguished lines between the verses, pre-chorus line, and chorus lines. Your interlude should flow naturally with the rest of the song, rather than intrude on its progression.Pop songs, like other songs, are never perfect the first go around. Rerecord the song until it is exactly right. Note how you feel during the song. The essence of a good pop song is if you can feel the emotions you are trying to convey.  This can literally be anything you want it to be, but it should have something to do with your topic. Often times pop songs have titles which use lines from the chorus. This makes it easier for a general audience to look up your song later on. However, if your song is very metaphorical, you may want to give your song a more obvious title.For example, if your song is about depression, but you never explicitly say it in the song, your title should reflect it.	Seek inspiration or influence. Brainstorm different ideas. Focus your ideas on a singular topic. Say something old in a new way. Construct an outline for your lyrics. Attach a rhythm groove to your outlined lyrics. Begin your song with a hook. Decide on a melody for your song. Create a chord progression. Add a bridge or interlude. End your song.

To attract an agent or other clients, make a website and build a social media presence. You need to be easily located and well represented online.Make a professional-looking website that showcases your work. Your website should include examples of your work, your artist CV, and a list of events (gallery shows, performances, etc) that you have participated in.   If you are a performer, include headshots. If you are a visual artist, you should have online portfolios of your work. Consider getting a Twitter, Instagram, Tumblr, Facebook page, or other form of social media. Post examples of your work and updates on your progress. This can be a great way to connect with other artists, as well as with talent agents.; , Whether you are a musician, a writer, an actor, or a painter, you can benefit from the help of a professional who represents talent. Read your contract carefully, however, especially if you are a musician. You should retain the rights to your own work.   . Look up agents who represent other artists you admire and ask for an interview. If you get an interview, ask how many clients they represent-avoid agents who are overbooked. Get a gallery to represent you. Visit galleries and talk to the curators. If you like the art they show, they might like your art. Galleries will show your work in exchange for a cut of the profits. . Send a demo to record labels you like. Consider getting a manager to facilitate this process.  If you are a visual artist, exhibit your work at art fairs. In some cases you may already need gallery representation to do this, but in others you can show and sell your work for an entry fee. If you are a performer, put on amateur shows and invite friends and other artists to watch.   If you are a writer, connect with local reading series and ask to be included in a lineup. If you are a musician, send demos to local music venues and ask them to book you for a show.  Collaboration is a great way to become known in your community, which can open up doors for you over time. Consider forming or joining an artist's collective, making collaborative work with other artists, putting on a show with a group of artists you admire, or otherwise working to promote (and become known to) your peers.	Represent yourself online. Seek representation. Exhibit your work yourself. Work with other artists.
Not only will this information help you get rid of the frogs, since different species respond to different methods, but it will also ensure that you're not doing something illegal, as some species of frogs are protected by law. There are some species of frogs that are considered invasive and are legal to kill. These include the following:   Bullfrogs outside of their native environment in eastern North America. They compete with native frogs, eat native frogs, and spread chytridiomycosis, an infectious disease that has led to the extinction of 100 frog species. Cane toads outside of their native environment in Central and South America. While not a frog, many people reading this article will be dealing with these amphibians. They are especially rampant in Australia.       Cuban tree frogs outside of their native habitat in Cuba. These are a big nuisance in Florida, where they even cause power outages.Coqui frogs outside of their native environment in Puerto Rico.      ; , In many parts of the world, it's illegal to kill non-invasive species, but people are encouraged to manage invasive species. Some species are so invasive that it's illegal to release them back into the wild once you've caught them.   If you're not sure whether a frog is native or not, take its picture and submit it to the local Fish and Wildlife authorities for identification. Before you take matters into your own hands, you might want to talk to local Fish and Wildlife authorities to discuss the best way to get rid of them in your area.  If you find out that the frogs in your area are native species, you'd do best to leave them alone. Frogs that are native to a certain ecosystem should not be killed, even if they're poisonous. Frogs are vital members of their ecosystems, and in fact their presence is an indication that an ecosystem is healthy. They keep insect populations down and contribute to wetlands in other ways.  If you dislike the presence of native frogs, there are still ways to discourage them from coming onto your property. You can keep foliage cut back, for example, so they won't have an enticing place to live. You can also discourage them from coming into the house by keeping it well sealed and screening your windows and doors.  Frogs are attracted to moisture, so removing sources of water from your yard will cause most frogs to lose interest and find another place to lay their eggs and shelter at night. You can rent a pump to get rid of most water sources.   Birdbaths, swampy areas, bowls of water, and artificial ponds are just a few examples of water sources that attract frogs.       Removing sources of stagnant water will also drive away mosquitoes and other insects that frogs feed on, making the area even less appealing. If the water source in your yard is something you want to keep, like a natural pond, try adding a filter or running fountain to your pond. This will cause the water to circulate, thereby eliminating most mosquitoes and other insects. The frogs will still be attracted to the water, but with a decrease in food supply, many may still end up moving on.  Tall grass, shrubs, or other bushy plants make the perfect hiding place for frogs. Clearing these elements away forces the frogs to be exposed, which is a condition they generally try to avoid. Having tall plants around a water source is especially troublesome. If you want to maintain tall or bushy plants somewhere in your yard, position them as far away from any water source as possible.  Like tall grass, clutter in your yard serves as an excellent hiding place for frogs. Removing it will chase many frogs away. Remove empty pots, old lumber, piles of wood chips, or any other structure that may create a damp, dark place for frogs to hide.  Turning off your outdoor lights at night will reduce both insect and frog populations.   Shut off garden lights and porch lights. Close the drapes and curtains in your house to reduce the amount of light filtering out from inside.  While somewhat uncommon, frogs do occasionally steal dog food or cat food. Feed your pets inside or keep the dish inside when the dog or cat is not eating.  Since flies, mosquitoes, and other insects are the primary food source for frogs, killing the bugs will deter frogs from coming to your yard. Here are a few ways to control them;   Use a bug zapper. Place the bug zapper on your porch to attract and kill all manner of flying insects.       Spray organic insecticides. Many chemical insecticides will also kill the frogs, but most organic insecticides do not have that effect.  Surround your property or pond with mesh netting or plastic fencing. Do not use chicken wire or chain-link fencing, since frogs can easily slip through these types of fences.   Make sure that the fencing starts at ground level and stands tall. Frogs can leap a considerable height, so a standard-size fence will work better than a purposefully low one. Take precautions to keep the fence stable. Bury the support posts 1 foot (30.5 cm) underground, at minimum, and bury a portion of the fencing material beneath the ground, too.  Snakes and cats both love to eat some types of frogs, so if you introduce some to your property, you'll be able to keep the population down, and your yard will be a lot less attractive to frogs. Before you do this, conduct some research to make sure the type of frog you're dealing with will make a tasty meal for a cat or snake.  Remember that many types of frogs are poisonous. Don't try to introduce a predator that would be sensitive to the frogs' poison. Research the predators of the specific frog you're dealing with. Cats and snakes are easiest to introduce, but you might also want to make your yard more hospitable to other predator animals, such as hawks or other birds.  There are a few natural substances that effectively kill frogs or repel them from the area. Try using one of these substances before resorting to a chemical spray, since chemical sprays tend to kill the frogs slowly. Organic sprays tend to do the job more quickly and are more humane.  Spray the frogs with citric acid. Mix 1.3 lb (600 g) dry citric acid with 1 gallon (4 liters) of water in a large spray bottle.Spray the solution directly on the frogs. It should kill them almost immediately. Spread salt. If you do not have any plants near your pond, spread a little salt around the perimeter. Salt will burn the toes of the frogs, deterring them from the area. Note that salt will destroy plants, however. Spritz the frogs with caffeine. Concentrated caffeine will kill frogs by causing them to have heart attacks, but you can spread coffee grounds around the areas where frogs gather to deter them without killing them off. It will cause the frogs discomfort, but will not likely kill them.  While there are chemical pest control measures you can take to get rid of the frogs in your yard, these options often torment or kill the frogs slowly and should be avoided unless no other option has proven effective. When possible, use repelling measures rather than lethal ones.   Try snake repellent.Spraying snake repellent around the perimeter of your yard is often an effective repellent against frogs. In fact, snake repellent is usually about as effective at getting rid of frogs as it is at getting rid of snakes.       Use herbicide. Studies suggest that certain weed killers chemically alter male frogs, stripping away their ability to reproduce. As a result, spraying these herbicides in areas where frogs gather can greatly reduce future frog populations.  Use a butterfly net or another type of long-handled, thinly-meshed net to capture the frogs one by one. If you have an abundance of frogs, you may need to enlist the help of others to accomplish this task. Once you catch the frogs, you have two choices:   Relocate the frogs. After catching the frogs, consider relocating them to a nearby pond or stream. When relocating frogs, however, it is important to introduce the frogs to an area that the breed or species can be naturally found in. Otherwise, you can upset the ecological balance of that habitat. Freeze the frogs to death.If it is impossible to relocate the frogs, you can kill them humanely by freezing them. Place the frogs in a sealable container with air holes punched through the lid. Store this container in the refrigerator overnight. The frogs will ease into a coma-like state. The following day, move the container to the freezer and store the frogs there for 48 to 72 hours. Temperatures this cold should kill them.  Use a standard aquarium fishnet to scoop up any tadpoles in your pond or other water source. Lay the tadpoles out in the sun for a day or so. The dry heat should kill them.   You can lay the captured tadpoles out on the cement or lawn, but the drier to surface, the quicker the extermination should be. Alternatively, you could also bury the captured tadpoles underground. This, too, should kill them.  If the frogs have found their way indoors, set up standard mouse traps to kill them. Place these traps around any opening that leads from the outside to the inside, such as garage doors, basement windows and vents.  If you are uncertain about how to remove the frogs or are unsuccessful in your efforts, hire a professional.	Identify the frog species you're dealing with. Check the laws in your area. Leave native frogs alone. Drain any standing water. Trim your weeds. Clear away debris. Turn off outside lighting.Light attracts insects, and insects attract frogs. Keep pet food inside the house. Kill the insects on your property. Set up fencing. Introduce natural predators. Try natural repellants. Use chemicals only as a last resort. Catch the frogs with a net. Gather and destroy the tadpoles. Set traps indoors. Hire an exterminator.
If you are not in your own vehicle and your choices are running on foot or using a vehicle, opt for the vehicle. It's still extremely dangerous, but will give you better odds of surviving than being on foot.If you do not have your own vehicle but find an abandoned vehicle as you flee from the fire, enter the vehicle and hotwire the car. If you need to break a window to enter the vehicle, break a rear window so that the front windows can remain closed. This is important, as it will help keep smoke out of the vehicle. Do not break into and hot wire a car that someone is likely to come looking for. You should never take someone else's means of escaping the fire. This method is only really applicable if you find a car that someone clearly left behind to flee on foot.  Once you're in a car, you'll need to ensure that the car is safely sealed from the smoke surrounding you. This is crucial, since you will otherwise risk passing out from carbon monoxide.   Roll up the windows and close the air vents., If the vehicle runs and you're capable of driving it, then do so. But it's important to drive safely, so that you can see your surroundings and so that anyone else on the road can see you.   Drive slowly and keep your headlights on.Keep an eye out for other vehicles and pedestrians. Stop to let any pedestrians you encounter ride along with you.Do not drive through heavy smoke. If the smoke is too thick to see where you're steering, it may be safer to park and wait it out.If you must stop the vehicle, park as far away from trees and heavy brush as possible., If the smoke is too thick to see the road, or if you cannot drive the car for any reason, you should remain in the vehicle. You will be more likely to be injured or killed by leaving the vehicle than you would be if you remained inside.Don't worry about the gas tank. Vehicles with metal gas tanks rarely ever explode. You are much safer staying inside the car than you would be on foot.Keep the windows up and the air vents closed.Lie down on the floor of the vehicle and cover yourself with a blanket or coat, if possible., Whether you are able to drive or you are forced to hunker down inside a vehicle, it's important to know what to expect so that you do not panic. Just remember that no matter what happens, if the fire surrounds the car you should not leave the vehicle.The temperature inside the vehicle will increase considerably. Don't worry - it's still safer inside the vehicle than outside.Air currents low to the ground may rock the car. Some smoke and even sparks may enter the vehicle. Don't be alarmed. Just stay low on the floor of the vehicle and keep breathing through a wet cloth to protect your airways.	Find a vehicle. Ensure that you can breathe. Drive if you can. Remain in the vehicle. Know what to expect.
Certain people are at higher risk of blood clots or DVT than others. If you fall into one of the following categories, you may want to talk to your doctor about taking special precautions when traveling. Risk factors include:Being older than 40 Being overweight Not taking anticoagulant medication as prescribed A genetic blood clotting condition Having cancer or receiving cancer treatment Being pregnant or a recent delivery or c-section Taking hormone therapy or birth control pills Smoking A recent major surgery A broken bone in a lower body extremity (ankle, foot, leg, etc.); , Consider an injection of anticoagulant medication if you have cancer, had a recent surgery or have thrombophilia. Depending on your medical history and condition, one of the steps that could help is to take an anticoagulant medication such as heparin. An injection of heparin can thin your blood and make it less likely to clot during the long flight. Ask your doctor whether this is a good option for you., Doctor-recommended compression stockings are a good lifestyle change if you are at risk of blood clots or have an upcoming flight.You should ask your doctor or pharmacist about the appropriate type of stocking, which may be a graduated compression stocking. They should go all the way up to your knee and can help improve circulation when used alongside regular exercise., An aisle seat will allow you to move your legs a little bit more during the flight, which will help improve circulation and reduce the risk of blood clots. Book your flight early so you can be sure to get an aisle seat.You may also be able to pay a little more for a row with extra leg room. If you can afford it, this may be another option to give yourself more space to stretch out.  People who travel on flights longer than four hours are at an increased risk of blood clots. If you can take a vacation or attend an event a little bit closer to home, you will reduce your risk. See if you can meet friends, family or colleagues somewhere a little closer, perhaps less than a four-hour flight away.If a long trip is absolutely necessary, consider breaking it up with stops in between and give yourself time to rest, relax and walk about for a day or two between the legs of your trip. If it is not possible, you should at least give yourself a few hours of rest between flights. In this time, you should walk around and stretch.	Know your risk. Ask your doctor about anticoagulant medication. Get compression stockings. Book an aisle seat. Avoid long, uninterrupted flights.
Before you so much as peek in the window, get down on one knee and check the ground for underneath the car for spots, drips or puddles. If they are there, try to figure out their age - are they old oil streaks or fresh spots? Perhaps there's even a puddle that has an active drip filling it from above?   Take a look, and decide whether this car just accidentally parked over an old spill, or if it is losing precious fluids right before your eyes. Although this is not always a deal breaker, any kind of drip, ooze, leak or seep can be indicative of much larger problems.       Dealers and owners will tell you that a little oil seepage is normal and this is partly true - some makes and models are notorious for leaking oil, but that doesn't mean that the car is in trouble. It's just up to you whether you think it's worth it to occasionally have to add oil.      ; , Puddles can also be made from brake lines, cooling systems, transmissions, power steering or even washer fluid. If you find a wet spot, you might want to poke it with your finger.   Reddish fluid is probably transmission fluid. Black fluid is generally just old oil. Caramel is the color of fresh oil, or old power steering or brake fluid. Green or orange fluid is probably coolant. Be mindful of clear puddles, which might be just water, meaning it rained, the engine was washed or the A/C has been running recently. Once you have some on your finger tip you should be able to tell if it is oil or water-based. If it seems like both, look out, and pay more attention in the following steps.  Sellers will often take a hose to a car they want to sell, and some will even try to clean up the engine compartment, but just as a rule, the underbelly of the car will be overlooked. Puddles or no, look to see how clean things are. You can probably ignore plain old dirt, and even expect to see a certain amount of road grime and greasy spots (It's a car, after all) but you'll want to watch out for drips or beads of fluids that have formed but not yet dropped.   Keep an eye out for wet spots, dark spots, and clumps of filthy oily sludge, paying close attention to the oil pan, and any seams or gaskets you can spot. It is not uncommon for there to be a little grime leftover from past issues that have since been fixed. However, fresh, wet grime or oil can mean problems, so take note of what you see. Don't hesitate to poke at things (maybe use a paper towel) to see how drippy, wet, slimy, or caked on they might be.  If you do see drips or runs of wet sludge, try to sort out where they are coming from. Leakiness might be enough to get you to move on to the next car in the lot, but it will be up to you to decide if leaks alone are enough of a problem to prevent you from buying the car.   Some folks will happily add oil to make up for a drippy oil pan, and can go for years without any serious repercussions beyond the expense and inconvenience of it. Some leaks are minor, and can take months to add up to significant losses, while some get progressively worse and can lead to real problems. If nothing is obviously leaking, dripping, or caked over with sludge, you can start feeling confident. A great number of potential engine problems can be ruled-out just by there being no visible loss of fluids.  Before you ever even start the engine, have your seller pop the hood for you, just so you can have a look at the engine and take note of any smells.   A pristine, shiny new engine should smell of rubber and plastic with a hint of gas or oil. In the best of all possible conditions, you will smell fumes that naturally come off belts, hoses, and the various plastic parts. This is called outgassing, and is completely normal. The smell of an engine compartment should not be too different from the smell of new tires. In a used car, you will almost certainly smell oil. This is normal, and so long as it isn't overwhelming, it's not something you need to be afraid of. You may also smell gas. A whiff of it is perfectly normal, and in older cars with carburetors, even a good solid waft of gas-imbued fumes is not an uncommon thing. However, if you are smelling a lot, that might mean a leak in the fuel system and could be a cause for concern. You may also smell turpentine, which is essentially the smell of bad, old gas. That smell might mean the car has just been sitting for a while. You should be able to ask your seller if there is fresh gas in the tank, and how long the car has been sitting for. This is not usually a huge deal, but stagnant gas can cause problems, up to and including rust in the gas tank. Another possibility is the sickly sweet smell of antifreeze. This could just be from spills, but you'll still need to check for leaks in the cooling system. On a cold motor, these can be spotted by a white-to greenish film; a sign that coolant has evaporated. An acrid, tart smell may also be present, which will indicate a need to take a closer look at the battery at some point.  Take a look at the engine. Do you see paint? Bare metal? Gunk? Dirt? Keep in mind that it may be preferable to see dirt or even cobwebs. Dealers and sellers will often clean up an engine compartment both to be courteous, and to make it look nice This does make the engine look better, but it can remove evidence of leaks, and even steer your eye away from obvious flaws.   A dirt covered engine, on the other hand, will show you where every drop of oil or gas has been, will show you which parts have been tinkered with or replaced (clean spots), and also indicates that the car has been driven, which means it has at least recently been working. Cobwebs tell you that it's been sitting a while, which may mean nothing, or may mean extra steps later on. A sludge-caked, grimy engine is a good and a bad thing. It an indicate a leak, but at least you can locate the source of the leak by following the path of the sludge. If it's just a heap of sludge and blackened goo, it may be time for new gaskets, or even a rebuild. However, this does not mean that the engine itself has gone bad, nor even that you won't be able to drive it for years before having real problems. A fuel leak will often actually create a clean spot on an otherwise dirty engine, but usually fuel leaks are fairly subtle, and you'll need to use your nose to know if they actually exist.  By now you will have stumbled across your oil dipstick. Pull it, clean it off, put it back, pull it again. Is there oil? Good. At this point, the oil can even be low, so long as there is some in there. Most cars will not show correct oil levels unless they are warm.   If you have an automatic transmission, there is another dipstick in there, so you should check this too, using the same remove/clean/replace/remove method. Again, you just want to be sure that there is some transmission fluid in there.       If you have power steering, there will be a pump in there somewhere. Usually this pump just has a lid with a small dipstick. Check to make sure that there is at least some fluid in there. Also check your brake fluids, while you are at it. Usually your brake fluid reservoir is translucent, and you can see without opening anything where the level is.       Finally, you should also check the coolant levels and the washer fluid levels. Take note of anything with low levels, and remember if you end up buying this vehicle to top everything off to its appropriate levels.  Ask your seller when the car's belts and hoses were last replaced. Cracks in the rubber most likely means that these parts will need to be replaced soon. A clever clean-up, and even old ratty belts and hoses can look fine on the surface, so don't be shy about reaching around in the engine compartment, squeezing hoses and plucking at belts.   If the belts are a little shoddy, just keep in mind that these will need to be replaced. Most dealers will have made an assessment of such problems, but you aren't necessarily working with a dealer, and these things sometimes get overlooked. Mainly, you just need to make sure that there are belts in there. Some cars won't start without them, but some have second belts that charge things or let your A/C and power steering work, so do be sure that every pulley you see has either a belt attached or a good reason not to have one. Check for soft, mushy cooling hoses, which is a clearer sign of age than their outward appearance. Check the areas where the hoses attach to things, and look for the telltale film of hot leaks. These leaky spots sometimes only develop when engines are hot, so there won't be any dripping, and a good dose of engine cleaner can make them vanish, so you do need to really look to see if there is even a trace of residue, not unlike the hard water scaling you sometimes have to clean from your teakettle.  It's not uncommon at all for used cars to drain their batteries as they sit, so don't be discouraged if the car needs a jump start at some point.  For now, take a look at the battery itself to be sure it isn't cracked or leaking. Look for exposed cable, which is not terrible as long as it has not turned green, or become caked in white residue.       Look for white (or green, or green/white) residue caked on the terminals as well. Usually this is just a sign of an aging battery that has been sitting a while, and can be cleaned up with a toothbrush and some soda water, and a toothbrush. Again, the best possibility is a layer of regular old dusty dirt, on otherwise clean metal and plastic. This doesn't mean it's a good battery or that the terminals aren't corroded in a way you can't see, but it does mean that no such potential problems have been hidden by an auto detailer's hard work.  If you are buying a car from a dealer, the air filter should be clean and new. If you're buying from a person, it could be old and dirty and need replacing.   If the air filter needs replacing, it is likely that more (if not all) of the filters (such as the oil, gas, cabin air, transmission filters) are due to be replaced as well. Ask your seller if you aren't sure or if you don't want to dig into the air filter to see for yourself.  If the car has a turbo charger, that's likely something you won't be able to diagnose until the car is running. However, at the very least you can check for leaks and make sure it is connected and not rusted through.  Step back and take a wide view of the engine compartment and its various goings-on. Every make and model has a different setup - there might be a lot going on, or it might be a fairly common and simple situation.   Look for loose wires and hoses. Look for little things that you might not understand, but look off to you, like uncovered holes or potential missing parts. Newer cars are harder to sort out, what with electronics (look for scorches, burns, obvious damage) and complicated vacuum systems. Older cars are simpler, and are more forgiving of after-market tampering. Discuss any changes or modifications your seller has made.  Stop and take a closer look at the underside of your used car's hood. There are clues there, if not always clear indicators. What you want to see is a clean, (again, regular dirt is not a problem) and intact liner, which is there to muffle engine noise and also to act as a fire retardant.   A sludgy, leaky, oil-burning car might have blackened the liner. If the underside of your hood is just darkened, it's likely not a problem, but if any part of it is scorched, burned, or has been torn away or removed, that's a sign of a past engine fire.       If you find evidence of fire, ask when and how it happened, and you may find that the engine has been rebuilt, in which case you just want to be concerned about any current leaks of fuel or oil. A past engine fire should at the very least make you wary, but even such a sordid history does not by itself mean the car is simply no good.  Exhaust leaks are one of the things that can cause engine fires. You might not have a good view of the exhaust manifold in the engine compartment, but it's easy enough to check the tailpipe. The exhaust tip should be ashy grey on the inside.   If it is black on the inside, this means that the car has been running rich (too much gas in the air/fuel mix), which is bad but not terrible, and usually just means poor fuel economy. White tips mean the car is running lean (too much air in the air/fuel mix), which makes for increased wear and tear, and a hot running engine.       In older cars this is a problem of timing and valve adjustment. In newer cars it indicates something wrong in the electronics; usually an O2 sensor, or perhaps an airflow sensor, sending inaccurate information to the computer, which then makes errors in regulating the mix. Either way, problems with the exhaust pipe will require a tune up.  So you've looked and sniffed and poked and grabbed, and nothing has scared you away thus far, so nothing to do but fire the car up and see if it goes. Three things could happen.   It starts and runs, first try. It takes a minute to get it going. It doesn't start.  You turned the key and nothing happened? Not so much as a dash light? Check the battery, and connections. Pay particular attention to the terminals, and make sure the cables are connected good and tight, and not corroded. Again, a little soda will help get these clean enough to keep a good contact.   Dash lights come on, you turn the key and then you hear a click, followed by nothing? Still probably just a dead battery, or even just a bad connection. Check it and charge it. Pull it out if you have to, or use jumper cables. The best practice is to remove the battery, connect an AC powered charger, and give it some time.       The engine turns over, but does not start? Give the gas pedal a good stomp, wait a few seconds, and try again. Pump the gas pedal as you turn it over. If this doesn't work, continue to try a couple more times. If the car has been sitting, it may just take some time for good fuel to be pumped from the tank to the engine. With any luck it will catch at some point and you'll likely not have to do that again.  If nothing is happening still, make sure the spark plug wires are snug. If you find a loose one, get it snug, and try again to start the car.   Still nothing? You will probably have to pull the spark plugs and clean them. If the car has a carburetor, you can also try dumping a few teaspoons of gas straight into the venturi (the part where the air goes in). This whole process sometimes has to be repeated, just to get the engine going after a car has been parked for a substantial amount of time. On that note, if you have a car sitting around and want to sell it, start it up once in a while so this doesn't happen.  Once you get the car running, get out and let the car idle while you look around the engine compartment again, and look for things smoking or leaking. Listen for wheezing, clicking, knocking or thumping sounds. Sniff for gas fumes (there will be a little) or burning (there might be some). Here are something you may hear, and suggestions as to what they might mean:   "TicTicTicTicTic" noise, increasing in speed as you rev the engine. Sticky lifters, flat cams, loose valves, and even a loose belt can do this. If it goes away after you add oil, or after the car gets good and warm, that's a lifter. Although it's nothing to panic about, it's something you'll want to address at some point in the future. A "NokNokNokNok" noise that increases in frequency when the engine is revved is called an engine knock. This can be bad news and might be a sign that you should walk away from this particular car (unless it's a diesel, in which case this is exactly how it's supposed to sound). Squealing, shrieking, squawking? This is usually the belt, or belts, and sometimes the pulleys that they turn on. Plan to change the belt. If the noise continues after changing the belt, you'll need to figure out which pulley. Alternators and air conditioner pumps can make these noises too, and can also just make scraping noises. Be mindful of such sounds, but unless they really start to bother you, don't worry too much A louder knock which does not match RPMs but may be present while accelerating or at low idle might indicate an engine or transmission mount that needs to be replaced. Not an emergency, but you'll want to get that fixed too, at some point.  Everything seem good? Close the hood, and if you are taking a test drive, take it straight to your local auto parts store and have them connect and check codes for other little things you might not have noticed. This only applies to cars from the 80's and later, and usually only helpful if there is a check engine light on after you start.   Your parts guy or your mechanic can help you out from there. You've done pretty much everything you need to do to be sure your engine is at least sound enough to get you to the store. As you drive take note of any issues such as a distinct lack of power, any odd shuddering, or any other sort of odd behavior. The code reader can give you some details to get you started on the process of replacing parts and electronics and getting things tuned in. Your local auto parts counterman has a device that can check your car's computer codes, and most will do it for free if they have the time. If someone tries to charge you for a checkup, drive on down to the next place. You might need a tune up, or even a rebuild. If you made it this far, though, you have a working engine. Congratulations. Your fluid levels filled, your battery charged, good gas in the tank, and you're driving. See how it feels - in the end that's what's important.	Check for spots, drips and puddles underneath the car. Identify what type of fluid any puddles are made from. Inspect the undercarriage. Decide whether leaking is a problem for you. Pop the hood and take note of any smells coming from the engine. Take a long look at your engine compartment and its contents. Check the fluid levels. Inspect the belts and hoses. Inspect the battery and terminals.Like the engine, batteries and their cables can clean up nice and still be bad. Ask about the air filters. Make sure the turbo is connected and not rusty. Step back and look at the engine compartment as a whole. Look at the underside of your car's hood. Examine the exhaust pipe. Test the car to see if it starts. Figure out why the car won't start. Take a look at your spark plug wires. Listen to the sound of the engine once you get it running. Bring the car for a test drive.
If you're into bicycling, you should already have one. If you have more than one, use the old one, at least first, in case you ruin it. A helmet with a flattish rear end, not a pointed one, will be easiest to use.; , (A lamp that straps onto the user's head, associated with mining.) It must have a hinged front light mount to direct the beam up and down, with a wide adjustment range.   Preferably the front light will pivot within a low-profile enclosure rather than swinging on an arm, and the kit will have a rear-mounted battery pack with a bright red rear flasher, a high-power white front light, a stretchy coiled wire connecting the parts, and take relatively high capacity AA batteries. LEDs are a virtual necessity for a long, bright life. An old one with a dirty or bad strap would be perfect, since you won't use that part anyway.  Heavy-duty automotive trim style double-sided tape or epoxy putty are convenient and fill gaps; liquid epoxy is stronger. Get a thick, fast curing variety to not run off of curved surfaces.   Other adhesives may work, but finding one that will bond to but not attack helmet materials such as a mix of plastic and foam can be tricky. Clean all mating surfaces and allow them to dry for a good bond.  Take the light and any other electrical parts, such as a rear light, battery holder, and associated wires, off of the strap. The strap will not be needed for this project.  The main light must be mounted where it does not tilt to one side or the other - many have a narrow beam, so accuracy is critical, must have have an unobstructed path forward, must be able to pivot to shine straight ahead (preferably with some extra downward adjustment available) rather than tilted uselessly up, and must not be at the lower edge of the helmet but instead higher up where it will not knock into your face in an accident.   Placement of the battery pack is flexible if it does not have a rear light, but the rear light, whether or not integrated into the battery holder, must shine straight back. The battery door must be openable when the holder is fixed in position. When test-positioning components and checking illumination angles, tilt the helmet to face straight forward as it would be in use, rather than tilting down as it would sit on a table. If the headlamp has separate front and rear components connected by a cable, the position of the front light forward to back along the crown may be chosen to take up excess slack in the cable. (The cable should not be kept in tension to avoid stress to it, to avoid stress to the components, to avoid stress to flexible adhesive such as tape that it may pull loose and crooked, and because tolerances help ensure successful construction.)  , Noting the constraint of placement of the rear battery pack or light, if any, affix the front light to the helmet as you had determined to be appropriate. It must face straight ahead, so check its path in a dimly lit room and tweak its direction as the adhesive hardens (or before you firmly stick down double-sided tape). Allow adhesive to cure fully before proceeding so it stays aligned.  If the helmet does not have a suitable mounting surface, a gentle curve can be built up with double sided tape, epoxy putty, or epoxy.   If it has aerodynamic-looking tail ends of spikes at the back protruding well beyond its overall thickness, you might carefully trim these in a relatively sheltered area (not the rear extremity of the overall helmet) to create a small flat mounting area while not harming the overall structure. Epoxy is very strong and headlamp components are very light: a large mounting area is not needed.  Choose power and blink settings. Blinking lights front and back are great for being seen even when you have enough light to see. , Enjoy your ride!	Choose a bike helmet to modify. Pick out a headlamp for adaptation to the helmet. Select a suitable adhesive to stick them together. Remove the headlamp strap. Test-position the components. Mount the front light. Mount the rear light. Turn on the front and rear lights. Put on the helmet.  , Adjust the front light up or down to suit your preference.
Cut out a 100mm nylon wire and unfold it, then place the iron earring hook at the center position. Fix the earring hook by stringing one blue seed beads on each tip and then pass the wire tips cross through another one.; ,  Add three blue seed beads on each tip and cross through 6mm Abacus Glass Bead, finally tighten the wire.       At each tip, string one 6mm Abacus Glass Bead and then cross through the 8mm Round Glass Bead.       Repeat the first action; just replace the blue seed beads with the silver ones.       Add on another one silver seed bead on each, then pick up the two wire tips and pull it and through the wire across to the starting Abacus Glass Bead.  When turn to the last part of the semi-finish crystal earrings, the detailed beading methods are just as same as the step2: add beads and cross through the shared beads.  So far, the above are all steps necessary in making your own earring at home!  ,	Add on the iron earring hook for your crystal earrings. Make the dangling part of crystal earrings. Complete the back part of the dangling part. By the end of the dangling crystal earrings, just tie a knot is OK!, Finished.
Use toothpicks for where the holes will be. Ensure your shapes are completely dry before applying the ART CLAY SILVER paste. TIP: Make your shapes a few days before you make your beads. To dry out the cork completely place the shapes in the warmest place you can find, e.g the dash of your car is a good place. The shapes will feel very light when dry. (See image cork forms.) , Use the hairdryer to dry paste in between each layer. (See image painting on clay paste)., This depends on how thick you are applying each layer. Bead should have a nice weighty feel to it. TIP: Make sure you keep your coats even. You don’t want thin areas as these may sink in when firing. Make sure you paint the clay right up to the toothpicks., Leave the area you want syringed uncoated. (See image Filigree heart), TIP: Don’t sand to much as you will thin the layers you have applied., This is where your imagination takes over. Using the syringe and the synthetic stones decorate your bead. To set the stones form a donut the size of your stone using the ART CLAY SILVER syringe. Place the stone onto the donut making sure it is sitting straight. Apply another donut using the syringe on top of the stone.(See image Setting Stone)., When you have completed decorating the bead use the hair dryer to completely dry your bead. TIP: To tell if your bead is dry place it on a small compact mirror. If there is condensation on the mirror then your bead is not completely dry. Continue drying until there is no condensation., Remove toothpicks from your bead before firing. If you are using a portable camp hotplate take it outside to fire as the cork gets very smoky when firing away. If firing indoors on your cook top have the range hood on hi and keep the room well ventilated. The cork will take a little longer to fire away than firing just clay. Approx. 5-10 minutes. (See image Firing)., You now have a hollow bead., (See image Brushing), This brings out the bright shine of the silver. On this heart bead I have only burnished the syringe work and left the remainder with the matte finish for contrast. (See image Heart Contrast).	Form the shapes for your beads out of the Core Cork Clay.      Using the ART CLAY SILVER Paste, apply first coat to the cork form.  Keep layering on the paste and drying in between each layer until there is approximately 8-10 layers. If making the heart bead that has a filigree corner, don’t coat the entire bead. When you have completed coating your bead and it is completely dry give it a light sand with a very fine sandpaper. Decorate your bead. Using the ART CLAY SILVER syringe continue to decorate your bead. Once your bead is completely dry you are ready to fire it. Rinse your bead under cold water and rinse all the cork ash from the middle. Brush your bead with the stainless steel brush to remove clay residue. Burnish your bead using the burnisher.
The 'budget' but classy way to do this is, to make one simple poster with white writing and a black background and get someone who works in an office to photocopy it as much as possible. Otherwise, you will have an extra cost for printing. Put the following on the poster   Headlining Band Band on before them Opening band Location Date Cost Any and all websites relating to bands, venue, tickets, you etc.  Put them up in music stores, local youth hangouts, Internet cafes, schools/colleges (if allowed) and modern clothes shops.  and tell them that the gig is on. Give them all the information you have on the poster, or even post them a copy of the poster. Write a Press Release, and send it to newspapers in your area, and the area of the gig, a few weeks before the gig. Try to get the newspaper to send a photographer if they have an 'Out& About' section or similar.  Try to set up your own account dedicated to your organising gigs if you are really serious.	Make posters. Put the posters up everywhere, but always ask permission before putting them up. Ring your local newspaper/radio-station/etc. Get all the bands to put the gig on their Myspace/Bebo/Blogger, or whatever.
If the rust only showed through the chrome in pinpricks, drying the surface with a towel after cleaning may be enough to keep up the chrome's appearance.  Apply a wax or polish to the chrome to protect it from any further damage. Use a product only for its intended purpose, such as car wax for chrome-plated vehicles.   Typically, wax is applied, buffed and left to dry, then a second layer is applied over it and buffed again.  This will keep a nice shine on the chrome, but the level of rust protection depends on the brand of paint and how well it is applied. Select a paint appropriate to the task, typically automotive paint, and apply as evenly as possible over areas pitted by rust damage. Use a fine, 1200 grit sandpaper to smooth it down after it dries, taking care to avoid sanding unpainted areas.  This is an expensive option, usually only performed on cars that were severely damaged by rust. Hire a mechanic who offers a chrome plating service if you want to re-chrome your car. If you're feeling ambitious, you can try to chrome plate objects at home, especially if they are relatively small.	Buff and dry the surface. Protect the metal using polish or wax. Apply silver paint. Get the object re-chromed.
You'll need a power drill, a dozen craft sticks, paint and brush (optional), a photograph (optional), a craft knife, glue, water, and embroidery floss.  Do this for the rest of your craft sticks. Make sure all the holes are drilled at the same spot on all the sticks.   Use caution when cutting with a power drill. Wear eye protection and do the cutting on a flat surface.  This will be the top of your fan and will spread out more than the base.  Allow them to dry thoroughly.   You may find that some colors, particularly reds, will need 2 or even 3 coats.  Make sure the sticks are touching, without any gaps in between them.  Enlarge a photograph or cut a magazine photo to the size of the sticks you measured. Make sure your image is the exact same size of the sticks when touching.  The image should completely fit over the sticks. If sticks are still visible at the sides, you should enlarge or cut a bigger image. If your photo hangs over the side of the sticks, you need to trim the image down.  Use a craft knife to score the picture lightly along the sides of each stick.  This will help keep them in order after cutting. Make sure you're numbering the back of the photo and not the picture itself.  Use a craft knife to ensure a neat, straight cut. Hold a ruler tightly against the cutting line and slide the knife along the edge of the ruler, pressing hard enough to cut through the picture.   Be extremely careful when using the craft knife.  In a small container, mix equal parts of craft glue and water.  You'll need to brush the glue mix on the back of one picture strip. Center the strip on a stick, and brush a thin coat of the mixture on all sides of the stick and picture. Repeat this for the remaining strips and sticks. Let them dry completely.  You can check to make sure your image is correct, by spreading the sticks back out to see if they're in order.  Tie a knot in embroidery floss or 1/8-inch (.32 cm) ribbon. Thread the other end through the holes that are 1/4 inch (.64 cm) from the bottom of the sticks. Tie a knot to secure the bottom of the fan.  Spread the tops of the sticks so they lie next to one another and tie a knot in the floss while the fan is open.  Add a dot of glue to the knots and let them dry completely before opening and closing your fan.	Get your supplies ready. Drill a small hole about 1/4 inch (.64 cm) from the bottom your craft sticks. Drill another hole about 1 inch (2.54 cm) from the other end on each craft stick. Paint the sticks with acrylic or tempera paint (optional). Lay your craft sticks side by side and measure the length and width. Prepare your image. Set the photo over the sticks. Gently trace lines along the photo. Flip the photo over and number the spaces. Cut the photo into strips. Prepare your adhesive. Apply the photo strips to the craft sticks. Stack the sticks in order with the holes aligned. Thread the bottom of your fan. Thread the top of your fan. Secure your knots.
On the whole, oleanders are low-maintenance plants that don’t need regular pruning. However, you should aim to do a major pruning of your oleander at least once a year during late summer or early fall. This pruning will help you shape your plant and stimulate healthy growth.Pruning at this time won’t interfere with the blooming of the plant, because it is after the plant has already bloomed for the season. Don’t prune past October. Pruning too late can make the recently cut sections of the plant vulnerable during winter.; , It’s essential to wear gloves when you are pruning oleander. Oleander is poisonous, and while for the most part it’s only dangerous when ingested, it can cause skin irritation and inflammation when handled. That is why it’s best to wear gloves when pruning or handling the plant.You may also consider wearing goggles if you have sensitive skin or eyes. Be aware that the toxin in oleander is primarily in the sap of the plant.  New shoots, also called suckers or basal shoots, are offshoots of the plant that grow up out of the base of the plant. Use sharp gardening shears to snip them as close to the base as you can. You can also dig up the dirt around the shoot and tear them out of the ground to remove them.These shoots can be harmful to the overall health of the plant because the plant will start to dedicate its energy into maintaining the shoot, rather than investing all its energy in the oleander.  If your oleander is too tall and its size is a problem, you will want to cut it down to size. Since pruning oleander actually encourages growth and branching, cut stems at half the desired height of the plant. For instance, if you’d like your oleander to be four feet tall, cut stems at two feet. Your oleander will continue to grow, and will reach four feet when the branches grow in.If your plant is more or less the size you’d like, you do not have to do any drastic cuts.  After cutting the stems to the desired heights, decide if you want to change the overall shape of the plant. When cutting branches, make your cut with sharp gardening shears just above the leaf nodes. The nodes are the sections where three leaves come out from the branch. Cutting just above the nodes encourages flowering.Your plant may have some scraggly or overhanging branches that distract from the natural shape of the plant. Cut these branches to emphasize the natural shape of the plant. You can also reshape the oleander into more of a tree-shape by cutting off branches near the bottom of the plant, leaving the area around the base clear.	Prune in late summer or early fall. Wear gloves. Snip off new shoots at the base of the plant. Cut oleander stems to about half height you’d like for the overall plant. Shape your oleander.
Make a pile of stuffed animals, a pile of dolls, a pile of board games, a pile of art supplies, and so on. Making a pile of your child's absolute favorite toys may be a good idea, too., Square or cubby shelving could work well, and clear plastic bins allow the child(ren) to see the contents of a particular container. (Make sure you measure both shelving and bins so you can be sure the bins will fit.) Label bins, too, if your child is old enough to read., You might not be able to fit all the stuffed animals, for instance, into a single container. If this is the case, divide this category further; for instance, into "Dogs and Cats" and "Other Critters.", If a child plays with a certain toy every day, they probably won't want to pull out a bin from the shelves over and over again. A toy box  could be a good solution.	Sort everything in the playroom into categories. Get containers and shelving. Split larger categories into smaller categories. Consider getting a toy box for your child's favorite toys.
Many main route establishments, especially rest stops and designated “trucker” stops, will have special parking spaces intended specifically for large vehicles, like semis and moving trucks. Be on the lookout for places such as these, as this kind of parking will make your job much easier. Some semi-trucks can need as much as four times the space used by a normal sized car.You might want to plan your route well in advance so that you know where you can park easily while on your trip. A few popular sites that give comprehensive resources on roadway information are:  http://www.truckstops.com/ http://www.cdljobs.com/resources/trip-planning http://longhauler-usa.com/    , Due to the fact that your large vehicle can block the view of smaller ones and sometimes create a dangerous blind spot on the road, there are laws in place to prevent this from happening. These laws will vary between state and country, but generally you should never:   Park on a road with a speed limit over 30 mph (48 kph) unless your vehicle is disabled. Park in a way that blocks the view of the road from driveways and other streets. Park with your vehicle facing opposite the direction of traffic., When you are forced to stop on the side of a road due to mechanical issues or some other problem, you must place emergency warning devices no later than ten minutes after coming to a stop. Different kinds of roads will require different placement of your warning devices, such as:   On or near a one-direction street or a divided highway, you will need to place your warning devices at 10, 100, and 200 feet (3, 30.5, and 61 m) behind your vehicle. On a two-lane road with traffic that moves in either direction, or on an undivided highway, you should place warning devices 10 feet (3 m) in front of and behind the front and rear corners of your vehicle and 100 feet (30.5 m) ahead of and behind your vehicle. On bends, curves, and hills that obstruct the view of your warning devices, you’ll need to place your rearmost device so it can be clearly seen before the sight obstruction., Smaller parking lots and residential areas are built with smaller vehicles in mind. The best way you can gauge the space of these places is by stepping out of your vehicle and getting a clear look of your surroundings.If possible, you should make use of a spotter, who can direct you as you move into the spot safely., Larger vehicles are much heavier than your average sedan. If your vehicle were to experience a critical brake failure, its weight would make it even more dangerous to others if it started to roll. You can easily prevent this from happening by always using your parking break as an extra safety measure.	Make use of designated large vehicle parking. Know the legal expectations for large vehicles. Signal emergency stops soon after occurring. Make a physical check of potential parking spots. Use your parking break always.
Determining if you're an alto or soprano or somewhere in the middle(sopralto) will help you find a song. Choose a song that best suits your voice. And if you DO choose a song that is too high or too low for you to be very good at it- just edit! The judges won't care if it's the EXACT way the original singer does it. If you sound good is what matters the most.; , This is optional, but it would be nice if you chose an outfit, makeup, etc. that looks nice. If you're performing with a group- matching outfits attract the judges attention.  You can sing your song a Capella(without music) but having music is nice too. You can burn a karaoke version of your song on a CD and have it played while you sing. Or even better maybe you or a friend can play a musical instrument and play the music for the song.  It'll be very important to practice in front of people, like your family or friends. Ask them for constructive criticism on how to prepare. Don't let them tell you you're already great, ask them how you can improve until you get it perfect!  , It's the day of the talent show. Avoid drinking milk.(Bad for singing) Do some vocal warm-ups like singing the scales up and down. Practice you're song again a couple times(Not to many! Don't want to strain your throat!).  Wave to the audience or introduce yourself before you start. If you find out you have stage fright then there are a couple techniques you can do. For me personally, imagining the crowd in their underwear doesn't work. Find a friend or family member in the audience and focus on their face, instead of all the strangers watching you. If there is someone out there smiling or wishing you good luck that's great too! Focusing on a loved one makes me feel more comfortable. While you sing, dance or you hand motions. Even if it's a slow song, it wouldn't be a bad idea to walk around the stage a bit. And most of all, enjoy it! No one wants you to feel pressured or uncomfortable about performing.  If it had been your friends who helped you practice, or your mom who bought your outfit. Thank the crowd for watching. It's common courtesy and many people will appreciate it.	Choose your song. Put some effort into your appearance. Choose how to sing the song. Practice. Know what to avoid and do prior to the show. During your performance, be crowd friendly!, After your performance, be sure to thank anyone who has helped you.
For turning spirals in a vice, a cylindrical metal stick or rod is used. The rod has a slit on one end, matching the thickness of the wire and a lever for turning it on the other end.       The rod is secured between 2 hardwood blocks with grooves according cut in them according to the grooves.                 The diameter of the rod dictates the diameter of the spiral. An alternative method would be to use a threaded rod with a slit and some nuts. The nuts would be turned onto the rod and fastened in the vice. The rod could be turned by turning 2 nuts onto the rod and tightening them against each other, after that the rod could be turned with vice grips, pliers or with a suitable wrench. A lathe with a metal or wood cylinder in it could also be used in place of the rod. The wire could be wound onto the cylinder by turning the lathe by hand or at very low RPM. Optionally, the wire could be guided through a stack of 2 pieces of wood to straighten the wire.  Adjust the threading density and spacing according to what kind of wire you need.  This can be difficult if the wire is thick or strong.	Use a vice. Turn the rod and wind the wire onto the rod.
Capo's are easy tools that help shift between different keys. They're usually used to play in a different key or voice, without changing the tuning. When the capo is on the first fret the low E will instead be an "F."   You'll tune the guitar into standard tuning, which is a half step lower than the first fret. Then when you remove the capo, you'll be tuned a half step lower.  Tune the first string down to an E. If you are using a piano, play an E note and match the low E string to that note. Take it slow and make sure the notes are synchronized.This can be a good technique if your tuner is not chromatic. Chromatic tuners hit all the notes including sharps and flats.  Go through each string either using a tuner, piano, or your ear. Play a standard E chord and check to see if everything sounds tuned.  After adjusting your tuning, you should now be tuned down a half step. Play an E chord after you've removed the capo., Go through each string within a chord, and make sure it sounds in tune. Rely on your ears, but you might need to use a tool.	Place the capo on the first fret. Find a tuner or a piano. Tune the rest of the guitar normally. Remove the capo. Adjust the tuning.
Turn on the amp with nothing connected to it. Slowly turn up the volume and see if you hear that buzzing noise. If you do, there may be a loose or frayed wire inside the amp. If there is no buzzing noise, you can rule out the amp as the source of the problem.   Always unplug the amp before inspecting the internal wiring. You may be able to solder a loose wire yourself if you can identify the problem. If you think the buzzing could be feedback, move farther away from the amp when you play. Failing capacitors may cause a distinctive 60 cycle ground hum, especially in tube amps.  If you haven't already, try plugging in your guitar using a different cable. An old or worn cable is a common cause of noise, although this is usually a 60 cycle ground hum rather than a buzz.  If this screw feels loose, tightening it can sometimes solve the buzzing issue. If this doesn't work, turn the guitar upside down, carefully unscrew the nut, and catch the connector. Check the connector's connections and re-solder them if necessary.   Volume controls, treble and bass controls, and any other knob can be another source of loose wiring. Remove the knobs one at a time, remove the nut holding the potentiometer in place, and inspect the wiring. Never access these areas while the guitar is face up, or the connector could drop into the body of the guitar.  Plug the cable into your guitar and wriggle it. If you feel something loose inside the instrument, there is probably a loose wire causing an electrical short. This could be at the pickups, the pots (potentiometers), or input jack. If you are up to the task, you may remove the back plate and solder the loose wire back into place. However, the soldering iron can easily damage the guitar's finish and other wiring. If you are not experienced at soldering or cannot adequately protect the surrounding area, take the guitar to a professional luthier for repair.  Depending on your model, you may need to remove the strings in order to unscrew the pickups. Once you have removed them from the guitar, check for loose connections and frayed wires. Make sure the connections are not touching any other metal objects.	Test the amp. Switch cables. Check the cable input on your guitar. Wriggle the cable to test for loose wires. Check the wiring on the pick-ups.
The easiest way to do this is to have a voice coach help you, but you can figure it out on your own. Start with a middle C on a keyboard. Play it and match it with your voice. Do this again with the next note down and continue until you reach a note you cannot sing without straining your vocal cords. This is the bottom of your range. Repeat this process going up in pitch to find the top of your range.Search online for videos of notes played up and down the keyboard if you don’t have access to a keyboard.; , Start with your normal range. Repeat a simple sound such as “la,” moving up and down your range. Master that first, touching upon notes at the high and low end of the range. Don’t linger on notes that put a strain on your throat. Focus on staying relaxed and breathing properly. Perform scales at least eight to ten times a day in practice.Continue this range practice daily until you can hit the difficult notes eight to ten times in a session.  Continue to use the scale exercise, attempting to sustain difficult notes for longer periods of time. Add in other exercises to loosen your vocal cords. Take a break whenever you feel uncomfortable. The more you reach these notes, the easier time you’ll have singing them without pain.One exercise you can add is slides. Sing a note. Instead of moving back and forth, stop at the next note. Do this for each note until you reach the end of your range. Another exercise is to grunt. Grunt to shorten your vocal cords, then sing a short word like “mom” in a note in your range. Move up or down your range each time.  Change the sounds of vowels during higher notes to put less pressure on your vocal cords. Try rounding your mouth into a loose oval shape as you speak a word such as “time.” Let your jaw drop and your tongue loosen. The “i” will take on an “ah” sound.This isn’t useful at the lower end of your range because your vocal cords are already shortened. Use scale practice exercises to reach those notes.  At first you can try singing individual words at the top of your range. Sing the word out loud, keeping the vowel sound rounded. At the end of the word, allow your throat to open so the vowel sound ends in the normal pronunciation. For example, transition back from an “ah” sound in “time” to the normal long “i” sound. As long as the normal sound returns before the next consonant, the word will still sound right to listeners.As you practice singing songs, incorporate this vowel modification into words on high notes until it becomes second nature.  When you stumble over a certain word at a tough note in the middle of a song, substitute it for a simpler word such as “noo.” Practice the song again with the substitution until you are comfortable enough hitting the note to put the original word back in.Vowel modification can be used in conjunction with word substitution, such as when substituting “thet” for “that.”  , You should always take the time to loosen your vocal cords before you start. This is necessary to reach notes on the edges of your range and avoid damaging your voice. Possible warm ups include performing trills, moving up and down your range with “me” or “oo” sounds, holding your mouth in an “o” and buzzing, and humming.For trills, place your lips together and make an “h” or “b” sound (lip trills) or place your tongue behind your upper teeth and make an “r” sound (tongue trills) as you move up and down your vocal range. You should also repeat exercises when you are finished singing to cool down your vocal muscles.  Expanding your range involves mastering the basics of singing. One of these techniques is proper breathing. Inhale deeply so the diaphragm muscle under your lungs pushes your stomach out. When you exhale to sing, bring your stomach slowly in so that you can sing longer and control your tone.Practice controlling your breath by breathing in for a set interval such as four seconds, holding for four seconds, then breathing out for four seconds. Increase the intervals as you practice. Taking in and using too much air at once won’t help you sing higher notes. Take in a single deep breath at a time and give your vocal cords a constant airflow to avoid strain.  Good posture also serves to enhance the airflow necessary to stretch your range. Plant your feet on the ground, shoulder-width apart. Allow your shoulders to relax as you straighten your back. Keep your head and neck up while singing. When you reach the notes on the outside of your range, remember to avoid tilting your head or stretching your neck.  Many beginning singers are tempted to tighten their body and strain their vocal cords to extend their range, but this is dangerous. Instead, stand firm against the floor without feeling tense. Don’t raise your muscles towards your throat when you sing. Allow your tongue and throat to stay as loose as possible. This will reduce your strain and increase your airflow, helping you reach notes on the edges of your range.One way to practice staying loose when not singing is to stick your tongue out ten times, two to three times per day.	Find your natural range. Move through your normal range. Work up to difficult notes. Round vowel sounds. Transition to normal vowel sounds. Substitute words. Warm up before you sing.

Many libraries subscribe to lists that automatically send them books from certain publishers. You will want to avoid doubling up on books, or buying something that the library doesn't need.; , Many libraries make the majority of their acquisitions at the beginning of their fiscal year. This is a good time to buy books, if you are part of library staff, but if you want to donate, you may want to help out later in the year.   Ask if the library needs a purchase order for every book it purchases. Many libraries are publicly funded, and a purchase order, or PO, helps them keep track of their budget.  Friends of the Library is a common non-profit organization that helps to support library collections and presentations. They often have a fund to help the library receive books or collections they need most.  Most libraries put an emphasis on acquiring very new books; however, they may also be in need of replacements for lost or stolen copies.  Most libraries prefer library-bound or hardcover books because they stand up to more circulation than paperback books.   Library bound books are bound with extra stitching and a hardcover, but are often less decorative than the original covers. Most library bindings are made through a special service, although some publishers have started to provide library bindings.  Libraries aim to keep copies of new books on hand for patron use, so they often pay the full price from the publisher. Library binding also adds money onto the process, which the library hopes will add value with further readings. Few new releases are acquired for less than $25 (18 euros, 16 pounds).  Book stores and even Amazon.com often give a discount to libraries and schools.  Some small to mid-sized libraries have Amazon accounts that receive an extra discount. If you go onto this site, you can buy books from their wish list.  Unlike other book purchases, sometimes payment is required within 30 days of receipt of the books. This allows the library to put it into the system.  If the book is not library bound, ask if you should arrange for a library binding to complete your library book purchase.	Inquire about the library's book buying process. Arrange to buy books according to the library's fiscal year. Contact the "Friends of the Library" organization. Ask for a current list of books the library needs to acquire. Consult the library on whether they prefer hardcover, paperback or library bound books. Understand that library books are often more expensive than privately bought books. Inquire where the library buys their books. Ask the publishing company if they can send the library the book before receiving payment. Buy the books that fit within your library's criteria.
Taking classes and practicing your craft as often as possible will increase the chances that you'll impress a casting director. Take feedback from auditions into account and work as hard as you can to improve, then try again. It might take dozens of auditions before you land a role, but every time you act in front of a casting director, you're getting valuable practice.  You can single yourself out from the other actors by demonstrating your other talents if they are relevant for the role. Knowing how to sing, dance, play an instrument, play a sport, and so on can give you an edge. Don't be afraid to break into song during an audition if you think it will help your chances.  A talent agent would be responsible for finding roles suitable for your style and experience level, eliminating the need for you to track down roles on your own. Casting directors often send talent agents descriptions of the type of actor they're looking for, and talent agents then notify the casting directors if they're representing someone who would be a good fit. Working with a talent agent is a good way to get an "in" after you've gotten some experience under your belt.   If you go this route, be sure you're working with an experienced, licensed agent. Some people pose as talent agents to prey on vulnerable young actors. You can expect to pay your agent 10% of your earnings. You can find an agent by attending a casting workshop, during which you would audition in front of both agents and casting directors. Do an online search for workshops in your area. The Call Sheet is a list of talent agents of good repute. Check out the list and contact agents directly., Becoming a member of SAG-AFTRA, the screen actors' labor union, can give you access to higher paying and higher profile work. It also provides health insurance and ensures your work isn't used illegally.	Act as much as possible. Hone various skills and talents. Consider finding a talent agent. Get a SAG-AFTRA card.
Heavy consumption of alcohol is a risk factor in the development of peptic ulcers.If you have been diagnosed with an ulcer, continued consumption of alcohol can contribute to irritation of ulcers and you should avoid it if you have an ulcer. This is especially true for strong alcohol and liquors.Alcohol can also lead gastritis, an inflammation of the stomach, that can severely impact the amount of time it will take for an ulcer to heal., Much like certain foods, caffeine can contribute to an increase in the secretion of stomach acid, which in turn increases the likelihood of your ulcer becoming irritated. Many stimulants have this effect and are best avoided when you have an ulcer. Caffeine is found in a wide variety of drinks such as coffee, tea, energy drinks and soda, so be sure to check the label if you're uncertain.It is thought that even decaffeinated coffee can increase stomach acid production. So it may be best to avoid even decaffeinated coffee., Quit smoking and avoid second-hand smoke. The chemicals in cigarette smoke can weaken the stomach lining, which irritates current ulcers or may even cause new ulcers to develop. Similar to other stimulants, nicotine may contribute to an increase in the production of stomach acid, which can irritate an ulcer. Nicotine can also lead to inflammation which hampers the healing process., Although there is an uncertain correlation between stress and ulcer pain, some ulcer sufferers find that when emotional stress in their life rises, so does the ulcer irritation. A program that reduces stress may have beneficial consequences and help you avoid irritating your ulcer. Try regularly practicing relaxation techniques such as yoga, meditation or tai chi.   Some research suggests that a formal stress reduction program with a class might be more effective for those with an ulcer than doing it at home alone.	Reduce consumption of alcohol. Cut down on caffeine. Avoid nicotine. Reduce stress.
Music paper has five lines and four spaces in between. If you don't have any music paper, just draw five evenly spaced horizontal lines with a ruler. Make sure to draw the lines neat if you don't have music paper,so it comes out right       ; , Make sure it's intersecting all of the lines from the music paper. It should be a little longer, so that it hangs off both ends.  Draw a semi-circle at the top of the vertical line that ends at the second horizontal line down. Now it should look like a long and skinny "P".  This new line should curve around the other side of the vertical line and intersect it again at the last horizontal line.  You're essentially making a semi-circle that's slightly smaller than the previous one. Make it so that the top goes a little over the third horizontal line.  The spiral should end on the second (from the bottom) horizontal line, which indicates the note "G".  Go to the end of the first line you drew, and draw a little line going off of it as shown.	Get a piece of music paper. Draw a vertical line. Make the line a "P". Continue across the vertical line and make another semi-circle. Continue to make the previous semi-circle into a spiral. Finish the spiral. Draw a tail at the end. Finished.
If the degreaser alone didn’t work, or you feel you need to deodorize a bit, you can mix ⅜ cup of warm water, 1 tablespoon of baking soda, ½ teaspoon of flour, and ⅛ cup of sea salt to make a cleaning paste. Add all of the ingredients to a bowl and mix until you have a paste.  The baking soda paste provides a bit more friction than most degreasers. This can help if you have a stain that requires a lot of scrubbing. Use a rag, or preferably a microfiber towel, to scrub the paste into the affected spot. If it is a small spot, or a spot with a lot of crevices you can use a toothbrush to better scrub the area.  Use a wet towel or microfiber towel to wipe away the cleaning solution and the grease. For this you need only use water, distilled water is best as it contains fewer contaminants that might leave water spots.  If the stain isn’t completely removed after the first cleaning, repeat this process until the stain is gone.	Mix up a baking soda paste. Scrub the affected area with your paste. Remove the paste with a wet towel. Repeat this process.
The average maturation time is between 43 and 50 days. By that time, there should be at least 6 leaves on each of your spinach plants. Pick baby spinach leaves from all the plants, so that every plant will keep growing to maturity.  When bolting, the spinach will begin to form a center stalk. If this happens, your spinach will be tough and bitter. Remove large developed leaves and remove any brown, withered or diseased leaves to prevent your spinach from bolting too early. You can start picking leaves as soon as they are big enough to eat.  Once your spinach plants have at least 4 true leaves, add some organic fertilizer to the soil. The spinach will not only grow faster, it will taste sweeter.	Harvest your spinach when it matures. Prevent your plants from bolting. Add fertilizer to encourage new growth.
Copyrights to a song are usually held by two separate entities. The first entity you will have to obtain clearance from is the owner of the sound recording copyright. This will usually be the record company that recorded the song for the artist.To find the owner of this copyright, start by locating the record company that is currently releasing the source music (i.e., the music you want to sample). If you have CDs, you can usually look on the back of the CD case and find the record label logo. If you have downloaded the song, you may have to look online for this answer. This task may be complicated by the fact that record companies often close and/or sell their copyrights to other companies. In other circumstances, copyrights may revert back to the original artists after a period of years.; , The second entity you will have to track down is the owner of the song itself. This will usually be the artist or a publishing company.If the owner is the artist, do an online search in order to find the artist's contact information. In most cases, this will be their management team or their lawyer. If you need to track down the publishing company, try the following:Locate the publisher through performing rights organizations. For example, visit the websites for Broadcast Music Incorporated (BMI) or the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers (ASCAP).If you are using the BMI site, you can use their searchable database to find the source song. If you cannot find the source song online, call the organizations and ask for their "song indexing" department., Once you track down both parties, you will need to get their permission to use the source song. Every copyright owner will do things differently. Some copyright owners are happy to clear samples and even encourage the practice.However, some owners will not negotiate with you unless you are signed to a record deal.   In addition, every copyright owner will likely want to hear a sample of your music with the source song incorporated to get an idea of how you are going to use it., If you reach a deal with both the copyright owners, be sure you draft and execute a valid written agreement. This agreement will set out the music you are sampling, how you can sample it, and how much you are paying for the licensing rights to the source song.   This agreement will protect you in case you are ever sued for copyright infringement.  The fee you will have to pay to the copyright owners will depend on a number of factors. The first thing you will have to think about is whose music you are sampling. The more well known artists will often demand a higher fee, if they allow you to sample their music at all. Conversely, less well known artists may not charge a fee at all. In addition, it is usually cheaper to license a small piece of a song than it is to sample an entire chorus.   For example, if you want to sample a Rolling Stones song, it will probably cost you a lot of money. On the other hand, if you want to sample a relatively unknown artist's song, it may not cost you anything. Also, it will probably cost you a lot of money to sample an entire Madonna chorus, as opposed to sampling an obscure drum beat from one of her less known songs., The amount of the source song you use will also dictate how much you have to pay. For example, if you are only using a one-second drum loop, you may not have to pay too much money. On the other hand, if you are using the entire source song's bass line, you may be charged more for permission.It is important to have an idea of exactly what you are going to do with the source song before you ask for clearance. The downside, however, is that if you do not get permission a lot of hard work will have been wasted., The final piece of the puzzle is determining how you will use the source song in your music. The more prevalent the source song is, the more money you will have to pay to use it. For example, if you are going to use the source song as a part of a five-second introduction to your song, you may not need to pay that much to use it. However, if you plan on using the source song's drum loop as your drum loop throughout, you may have to pay a larger fee. In other words, it will usually cost more to build an entire song around the sample, as opposed to only giving it minor attention., When you are negotiating an acceptable fee with the copyright owners, they may accept a flat fee for the use of their song. When you offer a buy-out fee (i.e., flat fee), you are offering to pay them once for permission to use their song. These fees can range from $250 to $10,000 depending on the circumstances. Most fees will fall between $1,000 and $2,000.Remember that you will have to pay both copyright owners in order to secure clearance. Both parties will usually want an up-front fee for the use of their song., The mechanical royalty rate is the amount of money you have to pay the copyright owner to make a copy of the song. If you agree to a licensing agreement and have to pay a percentage of the mechanical royalty rate, you will usually pay between 1/2 ¢ and 3 ¢ for every record you put out that uses the sample., You may also be able to negotiate to pay the copyright owners a percentage of your song's income or a "rollover." If you agree to pay the copyright owners a percentage of your song's income, it will usually be between 5% and %50 depending on the circumstances. If you agree to a "rollover" payment, you are agreeing to pay the copyright owner a fee when a certain number of copies of your song are sold., Whatever payment option you agree to, it needs to be included in your written agreement. It should be laid out in specific terms so there is no confusion. In a lot of circumstances, you may have to pay multiple types of fees for the use of one source song.   For example, you might agree to pay a flat fee as well as a mechanical royalty.  There are businesses devoted to negotiating and securing sample clearances. These firms often charge less than entertainment attorneys and have the specific expertise you are looking for.If you use a clearance expert, they will listen to your music and review your use of the source song. From there they will inform you of how much it will probably cost you to license the source song's use.   These experts will usually charge an hourly fee for their work. These experts will know the process, the costs, and the key players in the business. You will save a lot of time and money by hiring one.Conduct an online search for sample clearance experts in your area. If you have friends in the music business, ask them for advice.  If you think you need legal advice above and beyond that of sample clearance, you may need to hire an entertainment attorney. Entertainment attorneys can help you if you are being sued for copyright infringement, if you are trying to negotiate a settlement with a record company, or if you do not think you need to get a source song cleared. If you have friends in the music business, ask if they can recommend a good entertainment lawyer specializing in music copyrights.  If you can not get any valuable recommendations from friends and family, contact your state bar association's lawyer referral service. Every state has a service you can use to get in contact with qualified attorneys in your area. When you call, they will ask you a series of questions about your legal issue and in turn they will provide you with a series of qualified attorney contacts.  When you have a small list of qualified lawyers, conduct initial consultations with each of them. During your initial consultation, you should explain your legal issue and ask questions of the lawyer. In return, the lawyer will give their opinion and attempt to sell you on their services. When you speak to each lawyer, ask some of the following questions:   Whether they have ever handled similar cases to yours, and if so, what the outcome was. Whether they have malpractice and liability insurance. Whether they have been practicing in the area long and how many relationships they have with individuals that may become involved in your case (e.g., other lawyers, judges, record label executives). Whether they have any history of discipline from the state bar.  After your initial consultations, sit down and analyze your options. Weigh the pros and cons of each lawyer. At the end of the day, you want to hire a lawyer you can trust and who can effectively manage your case. When you make a decision, contact your first choice as soon as possible and let them know you would like to hire them.   Be sure you get a representation agreement in writing when you first hire your lawyer. This agreement should set out what tasks the lawyer is going to complete for you and how they are going to charge for their service.  A copyright protects the creators of original works and incentivize the creation of these artistic pieces. When someone holds a copyright to a piece of work, they can, among other things, choose to sell, lease, or lend their rights to others.If you use a sample without clearance, you may be the subject of a copyright infringement lawsuit. If you are the subject of an infringement lawsuit and lose, you may be liable for:Statutory damages, which are damage awards set by law. For copyright infringement cases, you may be required to pay anywhere from $500 to $20,000 for a single act. In addition, if you infringed on the copyright willfully, damages can be as much as $100,000. Also, a court may issue an injunction forcing you to stop using the source song. This might include recalling all of your albums using the source song and destroying them.  Sample clearance may not be required in every scenario where a source song is sampled. For example, if you are using a sample in your own home and do not reproduce or sell your music, you may be able to sample freely. In addition, if you are playing live shows, you may be able to sample music without getting clearance. This is usually the case because live venues will pay blanket license fees to performing rights agencies., If you use a sample without getting clearance and you are sued for infringement, you may be able to raise certain defenses to protect your rights to use the source song. Two common examples of defenses include "fair use" and "non-infringement."   You may be able to argue that your use of the source song is not an infringement because an average listener would not be able to hear any substantial similarities between your music and the sampled song. You might also attempt to argue you should not be liable for infringement because your use of the source song constitutes fair use. In order to successfully argue this in court, you will need to be able to show that your use of the source song was for a limited purpose (e.g., educational use, for critical use, or for a parody). Courts will usually look to see how much of the original work you used, how you transformed the work, and whether you caused the copyright owners any financial harm., Interesting situations can come up if you have a record contract or if you are using the sample for selling or endorsing a product (i.e., in an advertisement). If you have a record contract, some provisions in it will usually require you to promise that all the music you create is yours. If you break this promise and the record company is sued for copyright infringement, you will usually be responsible for reimbursing the record company for the costs associated with that litigation.If you are using a sample in an advertisement and the sampled artist is recognizable, you will need to get the source artist's permission to use the song. This is because the advertisement might create the impression that the artist is endorsing the product. If you do not get the artist's permission, they can sue you for the violation of their "right of publicity."	Track down the sound recording copyright owner. Find the owner of the song. Negotiate a clearance agreement with both parties. Secure a written agreement. Consider the music you are sampling. Determine how much of the sample you intend to use. Define how you intend to use the sample. Offer a flat fee. Pay a percentage of the mechanical royalty rate. Consider other payment options. Include this in your clearance agreement. Find a sampling consultant. Ask your friends and family for attorney recommendations. Contact your state bar association. Conduct initial consultations. Hire the most qualified lawyer. Consider basic copyright laws. Know when sample clearance may not be required. Defend your use of the sample. Research less common scenarios.
Determine if a blaster is right for your needs. If your paint covers a large area, then a blaster may be a better choice over a paint stripper solution. One form of blasting is soda blasting, which uses baking soda as the scouring agents. Soda blasting is also much more environmentally-friendly than using chemicals, and will not damage the concrete underneath.  To soda blast, you will need a pot blaster. Your local hardware store may be able to rent them to you. You will also need special sodium bicarbonate. The baking powder that you buy at the grocery store is too fine to use in a soda blaster. The proper powder should be available where you rent the blaster, but can also be ordered online.          Most standard sand blasters cannot work with soda. You will need to obtain a specialized soda blaster in order to use sodium bicarbonate.  Work slowly, holding the nozzle about a foot and a half away from the ground. Be sure to wear a respirator to avoid inhaling particles. Move the nozzle evenly across the painted area to make sure that no paint gets left behind.          If blasting near vegetation, be sure to avoid getting excess particles on plants. The high pH soda can cause browning and death in flowers and bushes. If you have a lot of paint to remove, consider hiring a professional blaster. The amount of blasting material needed and the size of the blasting unit will most likely be far too much to afford on your own.	Consider soda blasting. Obtain a blasting unit. Blast the painted area.
If you don’t have an office or a study, don’t worry. You don’t need to store all of your books in one room. Feel free to spread your collection throughout your house.   For example, keep all of your cookbooks in the kitchen. , You can display your organized book collection in a variety of ways. You may store your books on shelves or ledges. You can also stack your books in storage cubes.   For a more eclectic look, consider stacking your books on the floor, in a dormant fireplace, or down the edge of your staircase., Once you’ve settled on a location and storage method, you can finally put away your collection. Place the books on your bookshelves or stack the books in a storage cube.   Before you shelve or stack your books, you may want to clean and dust your storage unit.  For convenience, frequently used books should be readily accessible. This is especially important if children will be using the books.   If children are using the collection, store the books at their level. Instead of a traditional shelf, consider a storage system that would allow them to stack the books. Lastly, you may also want to store the books in the places they will use them the most, such as a playroom or bedroom., If you don’t have the space to display your entire collection, you may need to put some of your books in storage. To protect your books while they’re in boxes, follow these tips:   Stack your books horizontally with the heaviest books on the bottom. To fill in gaps, insert books vertically. Never place a book spine down. If possible, try not to stack more than three boxes of books on top of each other., If your collection contains rare books, you may wish to take extra steps to protect these special items. It is good practice to apply all of these suggestions to your entire collection.   Store your rare books out of direct sunlight. In addition to fading the book jacket, the sunlight will slowly deteriorate the book. Keep your books in their dust jackets. Before shelving or storing a book, always remove bookmarks and scraps of paper. Try to store your books at a consistent temperature. Too much humidity will generate mold in your books; too little humidity will leave your books brittle.	Choose a location for your collection. Settle on a storage method. Stack or shelve your books. Make books you use often accessible. Box and label excess books you want to keep. Protect rare, delicate, or important books.
Before you start shopping around, it's important to be able to understand the basic components of a turntable. Make sure that you fully understand the features and can compare the advantages and disadvantages of different brands, models, and styles of turntable.A basic turntable or record player consists of:   A record platter or plate, which is a record-sized circle on which the vinyl record will sit. The platter rotates to spin the record, and is often covered with an anti-static felt or rubber pad on which the record will sit. The stylus of the record player is also sometimes referred to as the "needle," and is the component of the record player that contacts the record itself. The stylus is usually housed in a cartridge, which contains the small wiring and coupling mechanism that connects the stylus to the tone arm. A tone arm can be operated manually or automatically, rotating the stylus onto the record. Good record players will have tone arms that will lift off automatically and return to place when the end of the side is finished playing. The base of the record player contains the internal circuitry and houses the various components. Ideally, turntable bases are secured on anti-shock feet to keep the record from skipping during play.; , Turntables can be divided into two basic categories, in terms of the way that they're operated. For the beginner, the difference may be minuscule, but it's important to understand the different machine-styles, depending on the way you intend to use your turntable.   Direct-drive turntables offer consistent machine-operated speeds that will never need adjusted, and allow dual-directional rotation. If you have any interest in analog DJ “scratching,” you need to buy a direct-drive turntable, or you’re going to be disappointed. Belt-driven turntables isolate the motor to one side of the machine, rotating the platter with an elastic belt. While the belt has a tendency to wear out over time in old turntables, the distance of the motor from the tone arm cuts down on incidental operating noise, making these models whisper-quiet.  Some turntables are basically a platter and a needle, with few frills or other features. Lots of modern turntables, however, come with a variety of different features that can make a unit more desirable and convenient.   Most turntables should come with a variety of playback speeds, measured by revolutions-per-minute (RPM). Most 12-inch records (large, LP sized) are played at 33 1/3 rpm, while smaller 7-inch singles are played at 45. Old shellac and acetate discs made pre-1950 are usually played at. If you want to play all kinds of records, you'll need to make sure the unit features all these playback speeds.USB ports are a feature on many new turntables, which allow you to direct-line in your record player to your computer and record digital files of your vinyl records. If you've got a big collections of vinyl you want to digitize, these are essential. Tone-arm cueing systems are available in manual and automatic varieties. Some record players are operated by sliding a switch or pressing a button, which activates the tone arm and drops it gently onto the record, while other record players need to be placed onto the groove manually. Automatic cueing systems are very desirable for beginners, since you won't have to fumble around with the delicate stylus. Anti-shock stabilization systems are excellent, especially if you want to take your record player anywhere for DJing events, or keep your record player in a heavy-traffic room. There's nothing worse than a skipping record.  Some cheap turntables are impossible to get apart, meaning that if a stylus breaks you'll have to scrap the whole unit. Because record players will wear out over time and suffer in terms of sound quality, buying a unit that you'll be able to upgrade is a smart choice. Most mid-range units should allow you to customize the belts, stylus, and the platter, if necessary.   Alternatively, if you’re not interested in making a long-term purchase, cheaper and flimsier turntables can be a good budget option. When it wears out, it’ll just be worn out, but you can get some use out of it in the meantime.  Like anything, more expensive turntables are generally “better” than cheaper varieties. How much better, though, depends on your own preference for sound and your intentions with your turntable. Decide how much you can spend and set a price range accordingly. From sub-$100 to high-end models in excess of $500, there are a variety of perfectly-listenable models.   A DJ looking to jump to analog live sets might be in the market for a more high-end record player capable of putting out the juice, while teenagers looking to drop a needle on dad’s old record collection probably don’t need to break the bank. If you’ve never purchased a turntable before, don’t overspend. Plenty of record snobs with room-sized collections play their deep cuts on used turntables that sound great. Save your money for vinyl.  Given the option, going big on a cartridge and spending less on a machine is always the better option. Since the stylus is the part that actual contacts the grooves, it has the most impact on the sound coming out of the speakers. As long as a turntable functions properly, it’ll sound great with a great stylus.   For comparison, a high-quality cartridge only costs about $40. While that might seem expensive for so tiny a component, if you can get away with buying a used machine with a worn out needle for less than a hundred bucks and make it sound brand new, it’s practically a steal.  Vinyl collecting comes and goes as a hobby, meaning that the market for units, records, and other record-playing equipment can vary widely in price. It's always a good idea to keep an eye on used units to look for deals on high-end equipment that someone else has gotten rid of. If you know how to inspect a record-player, this can be a great option for saving some money.   Ask for a hooked-up demonstration of a record player before you buy it. You should be able to hear it. Bring your own record, so you can be sure of the quality. Check the rotation of the platter. Platters should spin perfectly flush with the base and shouldn't warble as they spin. You can adjust this, but if you're going to spend money on a new unit, you want to make sure you're paying for what you get. A record player with worn-out belts will warble and distort sound. Inspect the quality and the pliability of the belts on a belt-driven record player to be sure the unit is solid. Belts should never be cracked and should return to their shape if stretched.  Record store clerks have an unfair reputation for snark, but try to give them a chance. Many record stores sell turntables or replacement parts, and many of the clerks will be perfectly willing to dish on local options for shopping, their preferred set-up, and other advice. You won’t know until you ask.  Most of the time, you won’t be able to just buy a turntable, slap a record on the platter and start rocking out after you plug it in. You need to run a turntable through a multi-channel tuner, or at least a good pair of speakers after running it through a pre-amp. Don't forget to figure your stereo into the equation.   Some new or portable turntables come with built-in speakers. What these lack in quality, they make up for in value. You can usually get a portable record player with no need of pre-amp, speakers, or other equipment for less than $200.  Pre-amplifiers are used to boost the sound of the record player to appropriate volumes. Most record players, new or used, will need to plug into a phono pre-amp to boost the sound, before direct-lining into the sound system. Some models feature built-in pre-armps, but both budget and high-end record players will mostly need to be paired with a pre-amp, which are available at most good electronics stores, for no more than $25-50.Built-in pre-amps make the process of setting up your record player a whole lot easier. It'll involve a lot of extra audio cables to connect your turntable to the pre-amp, then attach the preamp to the receiver.  Dust is the enemy of a record collection. If you're investing in a record player for the first time, it's important to learn to care for it and your vinyl records properly. Investing in some basic supplies will help you to keep your records clean and your stylus in good working order.A basic kit to go along with your player and your collection should include:   A felt or microfiber record brush Record cleaning fluid, which is basically a mixture of distilled water, isopropyl alcohol, and detergent Anti-static record sleeves Anti-static plate pad  , 7-inch vinyl singles played at 45 rpm will sometimes have a much-larger hole in the record than a 12-inch record. These need to be played by slotting a plastic gap spacer over the spindle in the center of the record platter, which will sometimes be included with the unit and sometimes not. It's an easy thing to forget about, but it can be frustrating to end up without one if you want to play some singles. Fortunately, they're available online or at most record stores for a dollar or two.  A good record player is useless without a tasteful collection of your favorite vinyl to play on it. While budget used vinyl is widely available at second-hand record stores, antique stores, resale shops, online venues, and garage sales, there's also a burgeoning new vinyl market to explore. Vinyl's not dead.   Rocker Jack White's successful boutique label Third Man Records puts on a variety of vinyl novelties, including colored vinyl, scented vinyl, picture-discs, and vinyl that plays backward. Record Store Day is a worldwide phenomenon, and can be a great way to get out and check out local record stores in your area. In the spring of each year, hundreds of new limited-run releases are made available to the public. It's the crate-digger's Christmas. Real record collectors are known as crate-diggers and can be found thumbing through the unlabeled boxes in the bottom of libraries, book sales, and garages, looking for unfound gems and diamonds in the rough. Famous collector Joe Bussard (whose collection of 78s is larger than the Smithsonian's) used to pretend to be an exterminator so he had a reason to knock on doors and ask if people had any old records they wanted to get rid of.	Learn the lingo. Decide between a direct-drive and belt-driven record player. Decide what kind of features you want. Only consider turntables with replaceable parts. Figure out how much you’re willing to spend. Buy a good cartridge. Always inspect used turntables. Talk to record store clerks for advice. Make sure you have a good-quality stereo to use your turntable with. Purchase a phono pre-amp. Get record cleaning supplies. Get a 45 gap spacer. Get some vinyl records.
You might want to call a professional to do this due to the hazard of electrical shock. There are a couple of things you can do, however, without specialized digital equipment that is unavailable to the average DIYer.  Raise the washing machine door. You should find it on the right side near the bottom front. You will find a plastic post pointing down that aligns with a hole in the lip of the opening.   This post is the safety switch that keeps the washer from operating when the lid is up. Use a small screwdriver to push down on the switch located just below the lip under the hole with the door open and the machine in wash or spin cycle. The safety switch is good if the machine comes on. Have it replaced if it does not.  Put one probe of the continuity tester on the hot (positive) post and the other probe on the negative post.   The machine is getting electricity, and the problem is inside the control panel, if it lights up. This is when you need to call a trained professional to check it out and fix the washing machine.	Check the electrical system. Test the safety switch on the door. Use a continuity tester to see if the washer is getting electricity on the back where the electrical cord is plugged into the outlet.
There will literally be thousands of others waiting near you to get their 30 seconds, too. Parking will be limited, so if you can avoid driving, do it. And if you're a minor, bring a guardian with you.   Get there very, very early. People will be waiting in the wee hours of the morning.You may want to bring some food, drinks (water!), a chair, and something to amuse yourself.  This will most likely take all day. That's even if you've been informed to get there at 8 AM. They are seeing thousands of people and won't likely get started until everything is settled and everyone is ushered into the arena (or whatever the type of venue). Your audition will likely take place 8 or so hours after you've arrived.   Account for the weather. Your hair and makeup may not look as great as you want it to when you're auditioning at 5 PM and got there at 5 AM. Bring extra makeup and comfortable shoes. You'll be grateful you did.  Finally, the fun part! When your number is called, a team member (someone you won't recognize) will approach you and listen to you sing. You'll be doing this in front of everyone -- there is no designated, blocked-off area for singers. Take a deep breath and go big or go home.   The judge will then give you a polite yes or no. They are not allowed to critique you or give you feedback. If you do make it, you'll be notified of a call back audition at a later date.	Get there early. Be patient. Sing your heart out.
You must be fluent in both the language of the TED talk (almost always English), and the language that you are translating into.Therefore, you need to be able to capture the nuances of spoken English well enough to translate it into the target langauge.   Fluency means that you speak or read your non-native language with sufficient skill as to equal or approach the level of a native speaker of that language.; , TED talks often talk about obscure and technical subject matter. If you choose to transcribe or subtitle, you must be fluent enough in the target language to translate the jargon and cutting edge vocabulary that you'll hear.  You must familiarize yourself with and abide by subtitling best practices. You can find a list of best practices at http://www.ted.com/participate/translate/guidelines#h2--subtitling. Some important ones to be aware of include:   Putting the proper number of lines and characters in each subtitle. Making sure the reading speed for each line is not too fast or too slow. Compressing the written material while preserving the meaning.	Make sure you are sufficiently fluent in the spoken source language. Make sure you are sufficiently fluent in the target written language. Familiarize yourself with best practices.
Consult your car's owner's manual. The manual usually specifies the battery size you should buy.       Ask an auto supply store employee to help you figure out the correct battery size.      ; , Keep driving needs and climate in mind and check your owner's manual for the correct physical size. Consider group size, which refers to the outside dimensions of the battery and the placement of the terminals. If you get a battery that is too small, it won't fit securely in the battery compartment of your car.  High temperatures are hard on car batteries. The electrolyte solution in car batteries evaporates more rapidly in hot climates.       A battery with a long life is important if your daily driving habits are primarily short stop-and-start trips. Short trips don't allow very much time for your battery to recharge. A battery with a long life is better able to withstand those shorter trips.    The date stamp code gives you the battery's freshness information. The first two characters are a letter and a digit — A stands for January, B for February, etc.; the digit specifies the year the battery was manufactured — five stands for 2015, six for 2016. The date code is engraved into the cover of the battery. You can find it as you look down at the top of the battery. Some batteries may also have a sticker with the date code.  These 2 terms are critical, especially if you live in a colder climate.   CCA indicates a battery's ability to start a car in 0°F (-17°C). CCA also tells you how much current the battery delivers to your car's starter. CA tells you how much current your battery delivers to your car when temperatures are 32°F (0°C). This rating is usually higher than the CCA. A battery cost increases as the CCA increases. The CCA is relative to how much lead a battery has inside it when it is built; as the lead increases, the CCA increases.    Reserve capacity measures how many minutes the battery may run using its power alone. You need to know the reserve capacity in case your car's alternator should fail.    Maintenance free batteries do not need to have water added to them.       Low maintenance batteries are unsealed and have caps on top that allow you to add distilled water — an important consideration if you live in a hot climate.	Learn what battery size you need for your car's make and model. Pick the correct size and type of battery for your driving needs. Look for a battery that has been on the store shelf for less than six months. Ask about "cold cranking amps" (CCA) and "cranking amps" (CA). Inquire about reserve capacity for the batteries that are in stock. Check the difference between maintenance free (sealed) and low maintenance batteries.
Usually, this is an image that you want to enlarge, but it is too pixelated or low-resolution to use in its current form. You can also scan an image or drawing onto the computer using a scanner.   If you are scanning an image into your computer, increase the contrast, so that it will be easier to trace. , Select “File” and “Place” to bring your photo or image into the program. Make sure your image covers a majority of your screen, so that you can work on it in detail.  Lock the first image layer by clicking the little square lock. The image will stay in one place while you work on it.  Click on your Pen tool. You are going to trace your image, so that it will create a sharp, vector image.  Choose the weight of the line that fits the line you are going to draw. Lines that are in the foreground should be thicker, while lines in the background should be thinner.   Always use black outlines and white backgrounds during this process. You can change the colors later.  Click the second point at the end of a straight section to create a straight line. Create curved lines by clicking a second point and dragging the line until it matches the smooth curve of the image.   Use the handles to adjust the Bezier curve. They can be adjusted indefinitely. , Remember that you want to create as few points as possible, while remaining as true to the shape as possible. This is a skill that will improve with practice., You can group these elements together later on. Fill in the colors when you are finished. You can add colors on the same layer or different layers.  Save your file as a vector image, such as AI or EPS. Use this new vector image for scaling.	Find an image that you want to vectorize. Download that image to your computer desktop or into an image folder.  , Open a new Adobe Illustrator file. Add a new layer on top of your image using the Layers palette. Return to your top layer. Choose a starting point to begin drawing or outlining your image. Click the starting point with your cursor. Press “Shift” to remove the Bezier Handle when you are ready to continue your outlining or drawing.  , Continue in the same clicking and adjusting until your outline is complete. Make each separate section into a different element. Return to the first layer, unlock it and delete it when you are finished making changes.
As the cold winter months approach, it's a good idea to check your engine oil and decide whether it needs to be changed.   Dropping temperatures cause the oil in your engine to become more viscous (thicker). When this happens, the oil flows too slowly from one part of the engine to another — this prevents the engine from being properly lubricated, leading to overheating and an engine that won't start. Therefore, it is often advisable to switch to a thinner oil during the cold winter months, in order to keep your engine sufficiently lubricated. If you're unsure about what type of oil to use, check the owner's manual for more specific instructions on what type of oil is best for your specific car, under certain temperatures and weather conditions.It's also important to remember that, as a general rule, the oil in your car should be changed every 3,000 miles (4,800 km), or once every three months.  Your car's belts and hoses are susceptible to general wear and tear and are particularly affected by the cold weather.   If your car isn't due for its 30,000-mile full-service tune-up this winter (where the belts and hoses are often replaced) then it's a good idea to check them yourself for any signs of damage and get them replaced if necessary. This step should not be neglected, because if something snaps while driving, you'll have no choice but to call a tow truck — which is far from ideal in the middle of winter., It's highly important that your engine contains the correct ratio of anti-freeze to water before the cold winter months set in, otherwise the coolant could freeze, causing the engine to overheat and potentially blow a gasket.   A ratio of 50% anti-freeze to 50% water is recommended for most cars, though in some circumstances this is increased to 60% anti-freeze, 40% water. Luckily, you can buy pre-mixed bottles of anti-freeze and water at the gas station.If you're not sure about the current ratio of antifreeze to water in your car's radiator fluid, you can pick up an anti-freeze tester at your local auto parts store for relatively cheap. If the ratio is incorrect, you will need to flush your coolant system before you can refill it with the correct ratio. If this is not something you know how to do, take your car to a mechanic or oil change location. There is, however, no need to flush your system if you drain and refill on scheduled maintenance.  If your car has a 4-wheel drive function, it's important to get it checked out to ensure that it's working properly, especially if you haven't used it since the previous winter.   Have a mechanic check the 4-wheel drive to ensure that the system engages and disengages smoothly, and that the transmission and gear fluids are at the correct level. At this time, you (and any members of your household) should also review how the system works and understand the conditions under which it should be used. 4-wheel drive can improve your tires' traction on snowy or icy roads, thus decreasing your chances of getting stuck. However, this doesn't mean that you should drive any faster or less safely than you normally would in unfavorable conditions.  It's essential that your battery is in good working condition before the winter months — in cold weather, your battery takes more time to generate power, while the engine requires more current from the battery in order to start. If your battery is in poor condition, it won't be able to handle these requirements and your car will fail to start.   Keep track of how old your car battery is — they usually last between 3 to 5 years, so if yours is somewhere in that range it may be time to get a new one. You can also ask your mechanic to perform a battery load test to determine whether your battery needs to be placed. Even if it doesn't need to be replaced, you should give your car battery a once over to check for any corrosion on the battery's posts and connections and for any fraying on the cables. You also need to check the fluid level if your car is relatively old — you can do this by unscrewing the caps on top of the battery. If the fluid level is low, you can fill it with distilled water. Just be careful not to overfill it. However, most (if not all) new batteries are maintenance-free and do not require distilled water to be added. In fact, there are no caps to take off.  The defrosting and heating units on your car are essential for your visibility and comfort while driving, so it's important to ensure that they are functioning normally.   The defroster helps to clear condensation from the inside of the windshield by blowing warm, dry air onto the glass. If it's not working properly, the windows can fog up and obstruct your view of the road. Have a mechanic check the defroster to ensure that it's working properly. If you find the window is still fogging up, you'll need to check your doors and windows for air leaks that could be letting in moisture. It will become pretty obvious if your heater isn't working once the cold winter weather hits, but it's important to get this fixed as soon as possible. It may be necessary to replace the heater coil — this can be expensive, but it will be worth every cent on those cold winter mornings. It's not just your comfort that's at stake, it's also your safety. If you're too cold while driving, this may affect your steering ability and attention to the road. Having a functional heating system could also save your life if you get stranded somewhere in your car.	Change your engine oil. Check your belts and hoses. Replace old coolant with antifreeze. Make sure your 4-wheel drive is working. Check your battery. Check your defrosting and heating units.
You can form a proper ball shape by placing your hands on either side of the clay, and rotating them in a circular motion.; , Place the clay on a smooth surface and press down on it until it is flat.  Take a plastic knife or scissors and trace out the shape of an eye (simply a small circle), winking eye (a thin arch), two eyebrows (also arches, but more curved than the wink), and smile (a thick curve).  It should resemble the image above (the iPhone version)., Once baked, remove from the oven and let cool. You now have made a clay winking emoji!	Roll the yellow clay into a ball, then place it aside. Flatten your black/brown clay. Carve the facial features.  Place each facial feature onto the yellow ball until it forms a wink face. Bake the clay emoji as long as the clay package instructs.
With the most basic setup, you will need the following materials:  Three cameras on tripods, with power cords and enough memory/tape to film the entire play PLUS the time that the house opens its doors (you don't want to be setting up when the audience is already seated).        Three extension cords for camera power.       Gaffers tape (for taping down power cords). This can be purchased at target or any other hardware store.       Something to record audio with. If one of the cameras has a decent microphone, this may suffice. Otherwise, you will want to record from an external source. One way is to use an external microphone; another way is to get a direct audio feed from the house sound board (if the house has a sound board).       For more information on this topic, you may want to do a search for the following key phrase: recording audio to a camera using an external source.       Proper adapters and cables to connect to your camera's audio input from your external source (microphone, sound board, etc).       Headphones. Essential for monitoring audio.       Clapboard/Slateboard. This is essential for syncing audio and video in the editing process. To purchase one, you can Google search the following terms: film slate, clapboard, slate board       You can also follow the provided link: http://bestofferbuy.com/Action-/-Clapperboard/-Clapboard/-Film-Slate-p-67644.html?currency=USD&utm_source=gbase&utm_medium=cse&utm_campaign=gbase       A way to upload your cameras' video and audio footage to a computer.       Video editing software.      ; , Decide where to place your cameras to best capture the play. Typical three-camera configuration is as follows: Camera 1 is in the back-center of the house; Camera 2 is house right or left, closer to the stage; Camera 3 is next to the back-center camera.  Connect the power cords (and extension cords if necessary) from the camera to the outlet(s), place cords as unobtrusively as possible, then tape them down so that nobody can trip on them. , Camera 1 should be framed to capture the entire proscenium. This camera will remain in a fixed position at all times. This will be your go-to shot; if an entrance or action is not captured by any other camera, this camera should get it (unless, of course, there is an action happening in the audience!).  This camera provides another angle option on the stage. It should be positioned to capture as much of the stage as possible, while not getting any shots of the backstage (between the legs). You may keep this camera in a fixed position or have a second person operate it.  Assuming you don't have another person operating Camera 2, this will be your main active camera. You can use this to capture close-ups on stage, and even some action going on in the audience if you need to.  This should be connected to the camera that is closest to the audio source. If you are recording with a microphone, use Camera 1, as its centered placement will give you the most even audio quality.  You can do this by either using the gain indicator on the camera (if it has one) or by plugging your headphones into the camera that is receiving the audio feed. You will need an audio source such as music playing or someone talking/clapping/generally making sound. When listening, check for level and distortion. If it's too quiet turn up the mic gain; if you get distortion, turn the mic gain down.  These cameras should be recording from this point until the play is over, so make sure you have enough memory/tape.  When you use the slateboard, make sure you and the slateboard are clearly visible in ALL cameras and clearly audible to the microphone. Using the slateboard gives a visual and audio cue to be able to sync to: the point at which the sound is made is the point at which the top and bottom parts of the slateboard hit. This is necessary for syncing all three cameras and the audio to the same timeline when video editing.   NOTE: Any time you stop recording on any input source (camera or audio) and start recording again, you must use the slateboard to provide another sync point.  The actual filming of the play is actually the easiest part of the whole process. Since Cameras 1 and 2 will be in a fixed position, the only thing you need to worry about concerning them is making sure they stay on, recording, and in place the entire time. With camera 3, simply make sure you follow the center of the action.   To track your shots more easily, it helps to have a copy of the play's script. This way, you may know when and where people will be making entrances and exits.	First, let's go over materials. Camera placement. Find a power source that is close enough to each camera. Turn all cameras on, place them in standby mode, and adjust focus and iris so that all cameras match in image quality as much as possible.  , Camera 1 framing. Camera 2 framing. Camera 3 framing. Connect your audio source, using proper adapters/cables (as explained in Step 1). Check audio. Press record on all cameras. Use slateboard to make a sync point for all cameras. Filming. For more great pointers on shooting with a camera, follow the links in the "Tips" section below.
Draw a rectangular box on the paper to contain your maze and create “start” and “finish” openings in the box. Use almost the entire area of the paper; leave only a small margin along the edges.; , Draw lightly because you will eventually erase these lines.  Each cell should only connect to two other cells, and the path from the “start” cell to the “finish” cell should pass through every cell. Try to make the path through the cells counter-intuitive. , (Please refer to Figure 1 (attached) for an example of a maze with steps 1-6 complete.)  , The borders between cells should fit together like the teeth of a zipper. However, unlike a zipper, the teeth should be of variable width and length. Draw new, permanent cell boundaries. (Shown in attached figure 2.)  , The paths should be about one centimeter wide, and their borders should be the width of one line drawn with a pencil. Only draw lines that are parallel to the edges of the paper. Make every part of your maze area either a path or border between paths. Do not create any dead end paths inside cells. Consider the MTF instinct when drawing your approaches to critical points. (Refer to the large attached maze for an example of maze paths.)  , Make sure that you did not inadvertently block a critical point in your maze and that an unbroken path exists from start to finish.  Try to make sure that no spots exist where the junction of two lines is ambiguous and it is “debatable” if the path is blocked. ,	Define the maze area. Divide the maze area into 6 cells of approximately equal area. Determine the connectedness of the cells. Determine the location of the critical points that allow movement between cells.  , Erase the cell border at the critical points to form a path between the two cells. Obscure the boundaries of your cells. Draw the actual paths inside your cells. Solve your maze. Proofread your maze. Scan or copy your maze to get ink copies that other people can attempt to solve.  , Finished.
Fitted bedsheets are the type which have elastic at both ends, to hold the sheet onto the bed. While you can still make this dress with a normal sheet it will require more effort as you will have to sew the elastic in yourself. You will need either a double (135cm/53 inches wide) or king (150cm/59 inches wide) sized fitted bed sheet, depending on your size and the size of skirt that you want. Check that you can't see through the material from any side, no matter how hard you look. If there is any simple, or even non-simple, way to see through it, don't use it - it will show your underwear, guaranteed. This trumps everything else, from sales to pushy store employees to softness and comfort. This may be a problem with cheap or pale coloured sheets. If you are recycling an old sheet, make sure it doesn't have any worn patches or marks.  These will be near where the elasticized parts end, you can identify them by the seams there. Find the place where the seam starts (not at the edge of the sheet)  , The line to cut along is usually clear from the creases from the way the sheet is folded in the packet.  When tackling the elasticated part, be careful that you don't lose the elastic inside the rest of the sheet. Then put the side pieces to one side so you can work on the main part of the sheet.  Just above the knee is usually a good length for this type of skirt, if you aren't sure.   It's often a good idea to get a friend to help with this step, as measuring yourself can be difficult. If you do do this yourself, make sure you don't bend down to check the measurement, you'll end up making it shorter than you intended. , When you're happy with this, sew the ends of the elastic together.  This should leave you with a tube of fabric with one elasticized end.  The "rough" side of your fabric should be on the inside. Make sure you keep the seam lined up at the top.  Stretch out the elastic to make this job easier.  There should be plenty of extra stretch in the elastic when taking it on and off, as you will lose some of the elasticity when you attach the top part of the dress. ,,, Do not pin to the skirt. ,,	Find or buy a fitted bed sheet. Find the corners of your sheet. Cut along the length of your sheet from corner to corner on both non-elasticized sides. Unpick the corner seams. Measure from just under your bust to where you want the skirt to fall. Cut the sheet to double the length you just measured, measuring from one of the elasticized ends.  , Pin the elastic together to form a circle, and check that you are able to stretch the elastic enough to wear it, and that it isn't too loose or too tight around your waist. Sew the length of the sheet together. Fold the material back on itself so you have a double thickness tube of fabric. Sew the tops of the fabric together. Turn the skirt the right way around and try it on, make sure that it is the right length and that it fits you. Take one of the side pieces of the sheet and, with the hem at the top, wrap it around you, underneath your arms, crossing the hems over at the front.  , Cut off the excess length of the material.  , Tuck the top into the skirt and pin the top part to the skirt where the hems cross over and at each side.  , Mark the line where the top of the dress will meet the skirt, while wearing the dress, with pins in the top part of the dress. Take off the dress and stretch out the skirt enough to sew the top part of the dress to it, following the line you marked with the pins.  , Sew the back of the dress to the skirt, once again stretching out the skirt just enough to do this.  , Cut off any excess material from the top.
Amps with a simple layout will have a single volume knob. More commonly, you will see 2 knobs, labeled "Pre" and "Post,” or “Drive” and “Master.” The first knob in each of these pairs adjusts the signal before it enters the power amplification stage, while the second knob adjusts the signal after power amplification. Start around 2 on the dial of your master volume.  The pre or drive knob will have a much more dramatic effect on the overall tone of your guitar. The pre knob allows you to produce a distorted tone. This is because the power amplification stage cannot cleanly handle input signals past a certain level. Turn the "Pre" knob higher to achieve a distorted signal.The post or master knob has a less dramatic effect on tone, but handles the overall volume of the amp. The master knob will not affect the distortion of the signal. If the pre knob is set high, set the post knob low to achieve a distorted sound at a reasonable listening volume. If the pre knob is set low, turn the post knob higher to produce a clean tone.  All guitar amps contain some form of equalization (EQ), often in the form of bass, mid, and high frequencies. Experiment with the EQ on your amp to find a tone you enjoy. The best way to get an idea of the amp’s natural tone is by setting each EQ to “twelve o’clock.”Twelve o’clock means that the knob is set directly in the middle. The term comes from the face of a clock. Some amps simplify the equalization to a single knob, labeled “tone.” Adjust the knob high to produce a higher frequency to give your guitar a brighter tone. Move the knob to a lower position to emphasize low frequencies that will produce a warmer, darker tone.  Some guitar amps will have a button labeled "Channel." This button is used to switch between clean and distorted channels, which will provide you with a quick way to increase the level of distortion. Pressing this button has the same effect as turning up the pre-gain knob and turning down the post-gain knob.   Some guitar amps come with a pedal to switch between channels on the fly., The gain knob on your amp is designed to increase the distortion of your guitar's sound. In effect, the gain knob also increases the volume. Not all guitar amps come with gain settings. Some guitarists value this effect so much that they purchase several pedals that produce this sound like, overdrive and distortion effects pedals.Gain is particularly useful if you play rock or blues music. Some players like to increase the gain on the amp right before a guitar solo.  Before settling on an amp, you should visit a music store and try out multiple amps. Each model and brand has an unique sound that is worth being experimented with. You'll see difference in the "American sound" with brands like Fender, and the "U.K. sound" with brands like Marshall and Vox.   Some guitarists even prefer to play out of a bass amp. Determine if you like the tube sound over solid state amps or vice versa - tubes tend to give a more classic, warm tone to your playing but require additional maintenance and care.	Adjust the volume of your guitar amp. Use the volume to effect the tone. Adjust the EQ of your guitar's tone. Switch between channels if available. Use gain on your amp. Play with multiple amps.
, When the brakes are not applied, they should be about 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) from the wheel rim, and when the lever is squeezed, they should make full contact at about half the distance the lever will travel.  You may use a lubricant in an aerosol can with a tube to spray oil into the cable housing at the ferrell where the cable enters the housing underneath the brake levers. A light machine oil with a small nozzle similar to "3 in 1" Oil, or a special brake cable oil purchased at a bike shop is recommended. WD-40, and similar products may "wash" the factory lubricant off the cable, and when they evaporate, there will be very little lubricant residue on the cable.  This is done by removing the clamp at either the caliper or brake lever, and pulling it out the opposite end. If you remove the cable, use an aerosol solvent (or even WD-40) to flush any dirt or debris from the cable tube while the cable is out. Apply a light coat of lithium grease or machine oil to the cable, and reinstall it if it is not damaged.  When the brake pads are about 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) from the wheel with the lever released, tighten the clamp.  Buy the same diameter cable, factory fitted, in the same length as the original equipment. Making up the ferrells, cutting the cables to the correct length, and threading cables cut with pliers through the clamps is a difficult chore.	Lubricate the caliper pivot.  , Check the adjustment of your brake cables. Lubricate the cables. Remove the cable from its casing, only if it is very stiff, or difficult to operate. Thread the loose end of the cable through the clamp at the end you removed previously, and check the "free travel" (the distance the brake lever can be squeezed before the brake contacts the wheel). Replace either the cable, or the complete cable assembly if the steps above did not solve the problem of the cable not moving when the brakes are applied.
The secret to finding a dance partner isn't a secret at all -- it's simply conversation. Look her in the eye, say hello, and introduce yourself. That may seem terrifying, but it is far easier, and more effective, then trying bad pick-up lines or hoping she comes up to you. If she smiles back or seems interested in talking, get to know her a bit and invite her onto the dance floor.While it seems cliche, confidence really is the best way to meet women. Simply put yourself next to her and start talking -- you're already ahead of 90% of the other men. If you're having trouble making conversation, just go out onto the dance floor and start dancing, usually with friends. Again, this just shows the kind of confidence that will make it easier to find women. You will get rejected sometimes -- but it is not personal. A girl may have a boyfriend, want to be with her friends, or just not feel great. Rejection is inevitable, so move on and find someone else.; , If you're worried about striking up a conversation or it's too loud to talk, just go to the dance floor and start enjoying yourself. As you dance, look around for women who are dancing by themselves or in a small group. You don't want to rush at them, but any women looking for a partner will likely have her eyes up as well.   If you're uncomfortable dancing, just sway back and forth with the rhythm of the drums. Lift each arm individually with the beat and keep your joints loose and relaxed. You'll blend right in. If a woman is with a group of friends, dodges eye contact, or seems busy with another man, just move on. Plenty of people go to clubs to find someone to dance with, so don't waste everyone's time chasing a girl who doesn't want the attention.  The near-universal sign of attraction is eye-contact and a smile.Whether you meet on the dance floor or at the bar, good eye contact and a natural smile is the key to sparking a connection. In fact, smiling is proven to be the most effective form of flirting, so look happy.If she reciprocates, you can:   Nod your head towards the dance floor. Ask "care for a dance?" Offer her your hand to her and playfully pull her towards the floor. Move in closer while you dance., This isn't just a bad way to spend an evening, it's not going to work. If you seem like you're hunting for a woman to dance with, trying everything to get one to like you, you're going to come off as desperate. Again, though it seems easier said than done, be confident, cool, and collected. You are there to have a good time, but you should remember that you don't need a woman to enjoy yourself. Talk to your friends, start a conversation at the bar, and go dance when you want to dance. You'll be surprised how attractive this personal confidence can be.   Never try and juggle multiple "options" throughout the night. Chances are good it will backfire, and you'll justifiably look like a jerk., Don't try to impress anyone with spastic, difficult moves you can't pull off. Simply feel the groove and get moving. Above all, try to do all the following moves fluidly, not as fast as you can or with large, expressive accents. If you want to practice, make sure that you have some music on. A mirror can help too, helping you see exactly what you look like to try and improve.   Dancing is all about feel, not showing off. As long as you stay on the beat (follow the drums if you get lost) you'll be fine. Repetition while dancing is fine! Don't feel like you need to change things up every 30 seconds., This simple dance staple can be used for at any song, anywhere. To do it, start with both feet roughly shoulder-width apart. Count out the beats on the drum: 1,2,3,4 - 1,2,3,4, - etc. Step your right foot out to the right on the first beat. Then follow with your left foot, tapping your left toe down by the right foot on the second beat. One the third beat, step your left foot to the left. Then follow with your right foot, tapping the toe down on the last beat. You'll be right back where you started, so keep repeating it. Variations include:   Keep your arms up, snapping, clapping, or pumping them to the beat as well. Just don't leave them glued to your side. Rotate and swing your shoulders with the beat to get your upper body involved. On the second and fourth step, try landing with your heel out in front of you instead of your toe, or placing your tow behind your planted foot. As you get better, trying moving forward, backward, or around as you do the two-step., Grinding is perhaps the most common and intimate partner dance that happens in the clubs. Luckily, it is also incredibly easy to do. Place your hands on her hip, and stagger your feet with hers so that you're not constantly bumping knees. From there, simply swing your hips back and forth together on the beat. She will likely take charge, so just lock into her rhythm and move with her, keeping your hips swinging from side to side. You can add some simple variations by:   Removing one hand and raising it in the air, or clasping on of her hands. Bending your knees together and going down low, especially if the song is calming down before a drop. Spinning her around and trying face to face, especially if there is good chemistry between you both.  It is the easiest dance move possible, but also perfectly acceptable in the club. Just bend your knees slightly to the beat, rocking your shoulders back and forth as you do. Keep your hands up, snapping or clapping as you do, so that your whole body appears loose and relaxed. If you've got nothing else, this will always keep you moving.   Remember to move to the drum beat. Rhythm is easy, just follow the "boom-clap, boom-clap" found in the drum section of 99% of club songs., Dancing well is not as complicated as it looks. Of course, complex moves take years of training to get right, but in the club all you need are two or three staples that you can string together. Once you can do the two-step and bounce confidently to the beat, try adding the following slight movements together, doing them for 4-8 beats and then switching it up.Bob or turn your head to the beat. Rotate one of your knees back and forth. Turn and twist your shoulders back and forth, bending down with the beat. Pivot or twist on one toe. Extend your arms out in front of you, crossing and uncrossing them.  It doesn't matter how good or bad you are-- if you stay in time, you'll be fine. Luckily, club music is easy to dance to, since the drums will count out your steps for you. Move your feet, shoulders and arms in time with the "boom - chick'" of the drum beat. Every time you hear the "snap" of a snare drum, touch a foot down. This should be all the rhythm you need.   Step one foot to the side, then bring your other foot to meet it. Then move back to the other side. This quick "two-step" looks natural no matter what is playing. Do not try and change or adapt your tempo to fit her if you feel off; this just makes it harder for both of you to find time together. Just listen to the music and sync your body up with that -- she will do the same without your help., In older forms of dance, a male typically led the female across the floor in complex patterns. Club dancing requires no such bravado, especially if you're not a natural dancer. So, instead of trying to be something you're not, just let go and enjoy yourself. Follow her led for a bit. Take her hand and spin her. Bend your knees and go down low together when the beat slows down. Move slightly away and bust a move, even if it's corny. Instead of trying to come up with the perfect dance "plan," just have fun -- chances are it will rub off on her.If you are a good dancer, and you feel confident, go ahead and take the lead. Don't pinch or otherwise make childish grabs at her. You'll destroy whatever chemistry there was between the two of you. Play it safe and follow her lead until you're perfectly clear on what she wants., Some ladies will want to increase the intensity while others want to take it slow. Don't rush into it, and definitely do not start grabbing or holding onto her. Depending on the situation, there are comfortable, non-confrontational places to put your hands, and let her dictate what she wants from there. Realize, however, that these are just suggestions -- the two of you should feel comfortable setting and respecting boundaries together. If she likes something, it's fine -- if she rejects it, you need to stop.   If you're grinding, dancing back-to-front and up close, you can start with one hand high on her waist, at about the top of her hipbone. If you're leading her to the dance floor, you can hold her hand or lightly place yours on in the middle of her back. If you're dancing face to face, you likely won't start with a lot of physical contact. But grabbing her hand and taking her for a quick, playful spin is a great way to bridge the gap.  Once you're dancing with a woman you should be having fun with her, not off looking for another conquest. The reasons are numerous, but the most important one is that it is rude. If you're not enjoying the woman you're dancing with then stop dancing with her and actually find someone else -- otherwise you should be in the moment with her., As the songs change, do the same thing with your moves. Get down low. Put your arms around different parts of her body (within reason, unless she suggests otherwise). Incorporate hand gestures on occasion. Above all -- do it with a smile on your face. You don't need to make a fool of yourself, you just need to have fun. So open up a little bit, make her laugh, and keep dancing. If you're looking to broaden your dancing move set, check out:   Learn to Dance Dance Some Basic Moves Dance at the Club.  Most women do not go to the club to find the single best dancer there and take them home, even though most men seem to think they have to be the greatest moon walker since Michael Jackson. In reality, the best partners are fun, confident, and able to stay on a beat. The lights are low, drinks have been poured, and the music is bumping. So stop worrying about getting everything perfect and have a good time -- you'll get a lot more dances as a result.	Strike up a conversation with a woman at the bar or edge of the dance floor. Head down to the dance floor to see if anyone wants a partner. Make eye contact and smile to see if she wants to dance. Don't spend your whole night searching for women. Keep your movements simple and low-key. Learn the two-step to get through any song at any club. Bump and grind if a woman moves in closely, so that your hips are touching or close by. Bounce to the beat if you're lost or unsure what to do. Mix and match simple movements together to appear like an amazing dancer. Pay attention to the drum beat to dance with rhythm. Let the "leader" of the dance come out organically. Let her initiate any increase in touching. Focus your attention on her, not other women. Mix up your moves as you get more comfortable. Don't look at dancing as a competition or "test" you need to win.
Since publishers look for new material based on genre, it's better for you to focus your songwriting in a single genre; you can also cross over to other genres later.,, Search the databases of ascap.com, bmi.com, sesac.com, in the U.S.A. or the performing rights organization in your country. Look for song titles and writers in your genre, find out who publishes them, and research how you can submit your songs. Another way to find publishers is to pick up Billboard Magazine, look up songs on the Hot 100, R&B or Country charts in your genre, and see the accompanying list of publishers.Call the publisher to confirm who you should send your music to, and in what format.  This is so important that if you don't live in or near a city where people can make a living writing songs (a 'music centre') then you should seriously consider moving.Attend industry functions Hang out wherever the 'movers and shakers' in your industry and genre hang out Go to songwriter nights Join relevant associations  In Canada: SOCAN (The Society of composers, authors and music publishers in Canada) In the US: BMI or ASCAP   Be assertive yet polite when meeting key people in the industry; remember that they are probably bombarded by pushy starving artists every day.Co-write songs with both published and unpublished artists (you never know when someone you've worked with will introduce you to their publisher, now or later)  , Here are some factors to consider when deciding whether or not to sign with a particular publisher:How quickly can the publisher pay? Does the publisher have an international network to collect money abroad via sub-publishing agreements or via membership of overseas collection societies? How is publishing income split with songwriting partners or other members of the band? Straighten this out from the start so you don't battle it out later in court. If the person who signed you leaves the company, are there others who are as enthusiastic about your music as they were who can pick up where they left off? Does the publisher specialize in your genre? Can the publisher pay an advance? Do you prefer a large or small publisher?	Define your genre and stick to it. Create a demo.  , Submit your music to publishers directly. Network within the music industry. When you're offered a publishing contract, get a lawyer.
Speed up your tempo only after you are comfortable playing rudiments at a slower pace.; , Because keeping solid time is so integral to playing drums, a metronome is a necessary component to at least a portion of any practice session.  Listening to music you are unfamiliar with can also help ease you into a new style.  Most professional drummers who get hired for studio work have a "toolbox" of drumming styles that they can draw from, which might include jazz, rock, funk, bossa nova, rockabilly, salsa, samba, or blues beats.  Instead of jumping ahead to learn new drumbeats every week, work through the styles you already know and practice them to perfection. Practice every song or beat until you can play it comfortably and confidently.  The lack of bounce you feel when you strike a pillow with a drumstick forces your wrists to work harder, which will benefit you when you play on an actual drum.	Learn drum rudiments and practice running through all of them smoothly. Play along to a metronome, or "click track.", Play along to recordings of music you enjoy or are curious to learn about. Learn to play variety of styles. Hone your style. Practice drumming on a pillow.
Ombre painting simply means painting in a gradient, employing different shades of the same color to create the effect of fading. Before painting your dresser, decide if you want to create an ombre effect from top to bottom or from left to right.If your dresser has drawers stacked vertically, you can paint each drawer face a different color. This will make top-to-bottom ombre much easier.; , When painting, decide whether you’d like to start with a lighter color and gradually move to a darker shade, or start with dark and move to light. You can use paint swatches to play around with direction before beginning.If you choose a vertical gradient and only paint your drawer faces instead of the entire dresser, you can mix and match light to dark and dark to light as the mood strikes you by switching the drawers around.  You can either paint the entire dresser ombre, or you can choose a solid background color and paint the dresser drawers different shades. Although the choice is yours, the gradient will be cleaner if you paint different shades on drawers alone and having a single background color, such as white or gray.Although using a single background color is the most popular way to paint a dresser, you can mix paint colors to create a gradual color shift in the background, then have a more dramatic ombre effect using the drawers.  Once you have decided on your preferred color and direction, purchase different shades of a single color of paint to correspond to your dresser. If you have five drawers, purchase five colors, etc.You could also create a few different shades by purchasing your preferred color and white and mixing the two in different ratios.  Painting with both a brush and spray can is a messy affair, so lay drop cloths down wherever you decide to paint. Even if you are painting in your backyard, you’ll want to have a piece of fabric to catch any stray paint droplets.   If you opt for spray paint, you may also want to place drop cloths upright behind the dresser, or stand cardboard behind the surface., Most dresser drawers have at least one drawer pull, so be sure you remove all of these before you paint. Although you could paint around the pulls, you run the risk of spilling paint on them and ruining them. Removing the pulls will also help you get an even coat over the entire surface of the drawer or cabinet.This would be an excellent time to paint your drawer pulls if you’d like to alter them to better match your ombre colors.  Even if your dresser has not been stained or painted previously, sand the area you are planning to paint. Paint cannot adhere to slick, smooth surfaces, so sanding will help toughen the surface a bit to help paint stick.If the surface of the dresser has not been painted or stained, this need not be a long process. Instead of using an electric sander, run a single piece of sandpaper over the dresser’s surface by hand once or twice.  Sanding leaves behind a lot of residue, so be sure to thoroughly wipe the entire dresser down, including inside the drawers. Sawdust is infamous for getting caught in unwanted spaces and could easily make the paint clump as you go, resulting in an uneven finish.A damp cloth is enough to wipe everything down.  Using long, consistent strokes, apply the first coat of paint. Allow the paint to dry before moving on to a second or third coat of paint. The more layers you paint, the darker your shade will be, so keep this in mind before you paint multiple coats.If you are painting the base white, you can begin there and move on to mixing colors next.  To preserve the amount of brushes you need to use, finish with a single paint color before moving on to the next. Although this will require more time to complete, you will save money on brushes and will avoid having to go back over any areas after you’ve finished.This technique is particularly wise if you choose to mix white and one other color, as you could easily mix up your color shades. Make sure you wash and dry your brushes thoroughly between colors to prevent running and splotchy color.  If your brush dripped and you weren’t able to wipe the drip away quickly enough, or you didn’t see a drip until you’d finished, now is the time to sand down those areas and any still-rough areas or edges of the wood.   Make sure the paint has dried completely before you sand.Using a damp cloth, wipe the sanded area down again, touching up any areas rendered uneven by the sandpaper.  Once you have completely finished painting, seal your paint job with a brush-applied sealant. There are some sealants specifically designed for furniture, if you’d like, but if your dresser will not be coming into contact with young children or animals, a simple coat of polyurethane will do.Sealing will help prevent fading, scratching, and scuffing, and will help your colors last longer.  Spray paint is much thinner than paint you’d find inside of a tin, so holding the spray can closer could result in a blotchy, unattractive coat of paint. It could also make your paint drip.   As you paint, move your hand smoothly from side to side., Although spray paint typically dries faster than canned paint, you should still wait between coats to make sure each coat has completely dried. This will keep your color consistent and even, and will prevent the spotting effect frequently seen when using spray paint.Provided you are in a clean area, you can enlist the help of a fan to speed the drying process.  As with canned paint, you must sand and wipe down any areas of the dresser with more heavily concentrated paint and wipe away the residue left behind. Thick drips are far less common with spray paint, but higher concentrations of paint (usually in a circular pattern) are common.After you sand, you might need to go back over the area.  Unlike canned paint, you can move from one color to the next while you wait for colors to dry, as you will not need to share containers or brushes. Because spray paint dries faster than standard paint, you may be able to move through the painting process more quickly.   If you move back and forth between spray paint colors, make sure you paint on a different part of the drop cloth to avoid accidentally spraying the wrong color on your drawers.  To keep the consistency of your paint, use a spray sealant rather than a tin of sealant. Many spray sealants are quite thick in texture, so a single coat of the sealant should do.	Decide upon a horizontal or vertical ombre effect. Choose the direction and severity of your gradient. Choose a background color. Purchase your paint shades. Lay down a drop cloth. Remove all hardware. Sand the painting area. Wipe down after sanding to remove dust. Apply the first coat of the first color. Finish one color entirely before moving on to the next. Sand any rough edges or paint splatters. Seal the painted areas. Spray your first color, keeping the can at least six inches from the surface. Allow each coat to dry before applying another coat. Sand and wipe down any bumps. Continue moving through your paint colors. Finish with a spray seal, such as polyurethane.
A crew sock or a knee sock would work great for this! The sock can be any color you like. It can be fuzzy or plain. It can even have stripes or polka dots! Jut make sure there aren't any holes.; , Once you the sock on, make a C-shape with your hand. Put your fingers into the toe part. Try to get your thumb into the heel part. If you can't reach it, tuck the sock into the groove between your thumb and fingers.         Open and close your hand. Your sock should already start looking like a puppet.  If you want your puppet to have a nose, make a dot for that as well.  Spread it flat on the table. The marks for the eyes and nose may look out of place, but that's fine. This is why you made them while wearing the sock.  You can do this with a hot glue gun, fabric glue, or tacky glue. For the actual eyes, you can use buttons, pompoms, or googly eyes. You can also draw the eyes on with a marker.          If your puppet is a girl, draw some eyelashes with a marker!  , You can also cut a triangle or circle out of felt and use that instead. A button would also make a cute nose. If you don't have any of these, you can draw a nose on instead!         , Your puppet is done at this point. You can still glue items onto it to give it more character. For example, you can glue some yarn to the top for hair. For more ideas, click here.	Find a clean sock that's long enough to cover your arm. Slip the sock over your hand. Use a marker to make two dots above the seam for the eyes. Take the sock off. Glue some eyes onto the sock. Glue a small pompom just above the seam for the nose. Add some other decorations.
A variety of different materials can be used to make art and each of these materials will create a different visual effect. For example, sculptors can use stone, marble, wire or wood to create their art. Similarly, painters can use watercolours, oil, chalk, and pencil. When you are looking at art, comment on the materials or medium used to create the image. If you can't identify them, look at the label., In order to sound knowledgeable while discussing art, learn to identify the style of art. For example, some common and recognizable styles include abstract, realist, expressionist, surrealist, or impressionist. A piece of art that uses realism can be easily identified because the artist attempts to create an image that looks real, almost like a photograph.Alternatively, an abstract piece of art does not attempt to mimic reality and instead, can include random splatters of paint or lines to create a thought provoking image. Familiarize yourself with the different styles by searching online for images of the different styles of art. For example, search for "impressionist images." Visit museums, which often group art by style. You may find yourself in a room of surrealist paintings, for instance.  The style of art can also be described by looking at the content of the image. For example, learn the differences between portraits (image of a person), landscapes (image of a place), or still life (image of an object) works of art., It is also a good idea to know some descriptive words that you can use while describing art. You can use them to describe the mood of the painting, as you perceive it:Dynamic Intimate Suggestive Challenging  , You may have heard of renaissance art, modern art, or cubism before. These are a few different time periods and movements within art history. To talk about a work of art, check its time period. Consider how the historic moment impacted the way that art was created.   Consider the movements that were happening at that time. For example, Cubism was a type of modern art that was developed in the early twentieth century. Artists, such as Picasso, departed from the romantic and realistic artwork of the late nineteenth century and began creating more abstract images.Think about any major world events, such as war, that may be reflected in the piece. Consider what was taboo at the time and place the art was made. Works that may not seem shocking now might have been, then, or vice versa.	Talk about the materials used. Identify the style of art. Consider the content. Familiarize yourself with common descriptive terms. Check the time period of the piece.
For best results, choose a pair that is roughly the same shade as the pillowcase used for the tunic. The pants should be fairly tight rather than baggy. Semi-baggy pants will work as long as they fit, but pants that are just wide enough to slip on and off are ideal. If desired, you can slim the pants by having the intended wearer try them on and pinning along the sides to desired tightness. Turn the pants inside out and sew along the pin-line. Finally, cut off the excess material and turn the pants right-side-out again.  Cut two long strips of canvas, felt, or another strong fabric in a shade that matches the pants as closely as possible. The strips should be long enough to extend from the waist to the hem of the pants along the sides. To create the fringe, cut 1-inch (2.5-cm) slits along one side of the strip. Space the slits approximately a 1/2-inch (1.25-cm) apart.The strips should be about 1.5 inches (3.8-cm) wide. If you’re short on time, you can also use store-bought fringe.  Use fabric glue or a needle and thread to attach the strips of fringe to the sides of both pant legs. If you want to make sure that the pants can be worn multiple times, it’s best to sew on the fringe. Glue or sew along the 1/2-inch (1.25-cm) wide section of the band that does not have fringe on it, and apply it over the side seam on each pants leg. If you prefer to wear a skirt with your costume, add the fringe all along the hem of a brown or tan skirt instead.	Find an old pair of tan khaki pants. Create fringe for the sides. Attach the fringe to the pants.
Mixing is the process of affecting parts of a single track and the overall master track. You can edit the high, low, and mid frequency range for each track. Once the tracks sound good together, experiment with panning the tracks to the left or right. Panning is a good way to isolate a track and blend it in with other tracks.   Most multitrack recorders come equipped with an equalizer (EQ). Mixing can help accent parts you want to be more present, or even hide parts you're not thrilled about. Equalize each track and balance everyone. Low sounds should be the strongest for a good balance. For inspiration listen to the Beatles with headphones. They only had a four track recorder and you can hear multiple complex parts interacting and balancing each other out.  Once you record your album, you can add certain effects that will improve the sound of the album. Popular post-production effects are compression and reverb. Compression squeezes the track together, lessening the dynamic range between the loud and quiet parts of the song.As compression brings elements of the sound together, reverb redistributes the sound to fill a space. Reverb widens the sound wave by stimulating the sound bouncing off multiple surfaces.  Mastering is a compression technique used in post-production to ensure every song is equal in volume. You also strive to achieve an equal balance in each speaker. Mastering is not an easy process and may require a more experienced engineer.   Some music software programs come equipped with a simple form of mastering. Record labels will typically have their own engineer to master an album they plan on releasing. There are different techniques for mastering, depending on the form you release your album (vinyl, CD, cassette, or stream).  Burn the CD through the recorder or computer and give it a listen. If it does not sound good in a stereo system or headphones, decide if you want to record certain songs again.   Pass a few copies of the demo out to trusted friends and fellow musicians. Ask them for constructive feedback on the album to determine if the songs are working., Create album art and make the album look good. You can create an image using a design software like Photoshop or Illustrator. Another option you could do is to use a photo of something.   Look at your favorite album covers to decide if you want to pay an artist to do something special like Santana's album Abraxas. Then there are famous album covers that are nothing but a picture like The Beatles' Abbey Road.	Mix the song. Add production effects. Master the album. Make a demo of the album. Design a cover.
If you find black patches on the leaves of your potatoes, suspect blight. This should be sprayed with copper at the first sign.; , If they're turning green, they're exposed to sunlight. Once they're green, they're toxic and no longer edible. Cover up with more soil to prevent this from occurring to remaining potatoes. And check that Fido isn't causing a problem; you might need to keep your dog away from the veggie patch.  Soil nematodes can be a problem for potatoes. If you find them in your potato crop, shift the crop around to another part of the garden. Another alternative is to plant the potatoes in fresh potting mix in the bag and to plant the entire bag in the ground.  Not only will they turn green as mentioned in an earlier step, but the risk of the tuber moth increase when potatoes are exposed at the surface.	Check the leaves. Check the tubers. Prevent pests from entering the potatoes. Cover up tubers if they're exposed. Remove aphids by squashing them or by spraying with soapy water.
There are dozens of wonderful characters to choose, from Cinderella (the most famous of them all) to Jasmine to Belle. Figure out which one you relate to most or simply like the best, and plan to dress up like her.   If you feel like a more classic princess approach, go with Cinderella or Sleeping Beauty's Aurora. They share that timeless princess style that includes elegant ball gowns and perfectly coiffed hair. Princess Tiana is a Disney character with a hardworking attitude, ambition and a sassy southern personality. She wears a pale green and yellow nature-inspired gown. Belle has a bookish personality and a gorgeous yellow gown. Snow White's blue, red and yellow dress can be found in any costume shop.; , Merida is the fiery red head from the movie Brave. While she doesn’t take any flack from her family, she’s still sweet and lovable. Consider this princess if you're a bit of a rebel.   Merida wears a floor length, long-sleeved blue dress with white lace embellishments around the collar and elbows, as well as a thin brown belt and matching boots. Start working on your Scottish accent now to go along with your costume.  Some may forget Princess Fiona's character as she's not the conventional beauty, but she's incredible. She's the leading character in one of the most popular modern-day fairy-tales, Shrek. Her story has a twist though, as Princess Fiona Lillian is cursed to live as an ogress. While she may be waiting on her prince, she's not afraid to throw a few punches of her own and take charge.   Fiona wore a velvet, long, long-sleeved dress with a gold belt and flats. If you are really committed to the character, think about all the fun you'll have painting yourself green!  , Though she has an itty-bitty frame, this fairy-tale princess has a huge heart. You may remember that this character wasn't a princess by birth, but she became one when she married Cornelius, the prince of fairies.   Her look featured a tri-colored, floor length dress. The top third was white with cap sleeves, while the bottom was light blue and the wide sash was teal. Fairy wings would really make this costume stand out.  Dressing like this magnificent character from The Swan Princess would allow you to wear two costumes instead of one. Remember, the golden haired princess, has the capability to turn into a swan during the day and return to her human form at night. She's brave and speaks her mind but with a gentle touch.   Her main outfit was an all-white dress with bright green accents around the neck and shoulders. The puffy sleeves were gathered in sections with matching green ribbon and belt which hung to the floor.  The headstrong leader from Antz is somewhat strict and stern but it all comes from a good place. This princess is tough and willing to protect her ant hill at all costs.   For this look, you can get away with wearing an all brown dress or brown shirt and pants. This option is a good choice for the dancer in you, as Bala loves to boogie.  Princesses aren’t just limited to the big screen in an animated feature, of course! There are plenty of real-life princesses with amazing style to choose from. Here are just a few:   Kate Middleton is real-life royalty based in the United Kingdom who has stolen hearts by marrying Prince William. She exudes grace and poise.She prides herself on being a real woman with accessible style. Try wearing a knee-length lace wrap dress, which is a go-to of hers. Princess Charlene, the princess of Monaco, became royalty after marrying Prince Albert II. She's been photographed wearing everything from long gowns to pants suits to a fitted dress. Princess Stéphanie is the wife of Guillaume, Hereditary Grand Duke of Luxembourg. She is a member of one of the oldest royal families in Europe. To dress like her, you'll need bright colors and short kitten heels., Nearly every princess, real or fictional, has dazzled her court in a ball gown. This is possibly the most princess-like garment you can throw on. Depending on the princess of your choice, choose the dress accordingly.   Cinderella wore a blue ball gown, matching headband and iconic glass slippers. Belle wore a sunshine yellow gown with matching ribbon in her hair and bright red lips.You may be able to find something at a costume store or a second-hand shop that fits the bill. Consider making your own costume so you can also add a little personalization.  Princesses can't wear ball gowns every day, but even their casual clothes have an elegant touch. For example, Princess Jasmine didn’t wear a ball gown, but that didn’t make her any less royal. Her look consisted of sky blue silk pants and belly-baring top.   If you can’t track down what you’re looking for, think a little outside the box by wearing similar items. For example if you do like Jasmine, wear a light blue dress, matching flats and chunky gold jewelry.If you prefer Ariel, put on some green pants, a purple top and seashell jewelry. Kate Middleton dresses casually all the time but makes it chic. She's been seen wearing a fitted pair of jeans and three-quarter length sleeve top multiple times., These small, extra additions will really make your costume stand out and become more believable. For example, how will everyone know you’re a princess unless you wear a tiara or crown? The sparkly head piece creates an instant regal effect and people will begin to bow in your presence.   Adding gloves and a wand will only add to your look. Find these items to complement the ensemble. Find the perfect pair of shoes like Cinderella's glass slippers or Snow White's black patent leather shoes. If you're dressing as Merida, you'll definitely need a bow and arrow. Going as Princess Bala will require a cute antenna headband. Remember to add tiny green ears to your costume if dressing as Princess Fiona. Princess Stéphanie loves to rock a big hat.

Generally, stay low and look for a space fresh air is entering. Often, it enters at the eaves and escapes, hotter, at vents higher up. Watch where you'd escape to. Don't escape to a long drop to the ground or an interior floor; instead, attract attention and be rescued.; , Pick up and set aside a loose panel, or swing a door or staircase down.   Until you've tried this, you're just in an attic, not really stuck in an attic. Some attics may have doors into other rooms, or onto a roof. ,, Use something hard to do the tapping, preferably. Do this every so often. , Shift insulation out of the way if possible and stomp or otherwise strike it to break it. Hold onto something so you don't fall through before checking what is underneath. This will open a hole to the room underneath. See what is down there before dropping through.   If the attic has a wall leading to an interior top-level room or an entrance to the roof, try to break that as well.    It may be possible to pop out a nailed-on wooden panel. The ones on the ends of a typical roof are probably easier to hit squarely and less securely attached. Do not strike a surface with nails poking through it. Take care not to throw yourself out after the panel.  If you have a saw, you could even cut a hole (careful, you don't want to be trapped in an attic injured).	An attic can be dangerously hot on a summer day, So, take care to stay out of the heat as much as possible while you work on getting out of the attic. Look around for the attic entrance, typically a small panel or staircase. Look for a light switch to turn on so you can see what you're doing, and so (particularly at night) others may notice your presence by light escaping from the attic.  , If you have a cell phone or other communication device, call for help.  , Tap several times on the beams and the roof to attract attention. If you are feeling weak or sick you should do something quickly to avoid collapsing and cooking.  , Look for a spot in the ceiling made of soft material only, such as sheet rock (generally the whole ceiling in a house is made of it) or wood strips and plaster. Alternatively, pop out a vent or grill to admit fresh air and attract attention, or escape through it if you must. Use a tool to escape if you have it and help is not coming.
Remove the guitar strings and then unscrew the neck of the guitar from the body. Once the body is standing alone, unscrew the screws and knobs on the front of the guitar. Remove the screws on the pickups and bridge of the guitar.If there is a faceplate over your volume knobs, you'll have to remove the plastic portions of the knobs before you can lift the faceplate off.; , Once all of the screws are out on the face of the guitar, you can lift up your bridge and pickups, which are connected by wires. Snip these and solder them later when you put your guitar back together. If you feel unsure about taking your guitar apart, take it to a guitar store so that they can safely do it for you. Make sure all the electrical wiring is removed from the guitar before you start painting it.  Set your heat gun or hairdryer to the lowest setting and move it back and forth, across the body of your guitar. The heat from your hairdryer or heat gun will soften the finish on your guitar and make it easier to lift up the paint. Continue heating the paint for five minutes and then use a sharp tool to poke at the paint. If the paint feels soft, you can go onto the next step.Do not hold the heat gun in one spot for too long or you may burn the wood that's under the paint.  Start by scoring a small location on the softened paint. Use your putty knife to lift off the old finish and don't worry if it cracks off. Continue to scrape the paint and remove the old finish without damaging the wood under it. If the paint isn't coming off, use the heat gun again to soften it. Once you're done removing the finish, you should see the wood grain under it., Use a 100 grit sandpaper at first and sand over the surface of the guitar's body in the direction of the grain. Sand down irregularities so that the body of the guitar is as smooth as possible. Follow the contours of the guitar and sand the sides and edges of the guitar as well. Once you've sanded it with the 100 grit sandpaper, you can move to a 200 grit sandpaper to sand out smaller irregularities.Use a sanding block if the sandpaper is hurting your hands.  As you sand down your guitar, you're likely to find bumps or divots in the body. Fill divots that you can't sand down with an automotive filler. Once the divots are filled, let it dry for at least 20 minutes so that the automotive filler can cure.Bondo is a popular type of automotive filler., Once you've filled in all divots and the guitar is relatively smooth, you'll have to do one last sanding with the 100 grit sandpaper. Continue to sand until the automotive filler lies flush with the body of the guitar., Don't saturate the wood grain on your guitar to prevent moisture from getting absorbed into to the guitar. Take a microfiber cloth or a clean rag and wipe over the surface, making sure to remove any sawdust or debris that might be on the guitar.   Debris or dust left on the guitar will get sealed into the paint job.  Lay down drop cloths under the guitar so that the paint doesn't stain the surface that you're painting on. Alternatively, you can hang the guitar from the ceiling and spray it as it's suspended in the air., You can purchase wood sealer online or at a hardware store. Purchase a water based wood sealer that has a high gloss. If you are painting your guitar a lighter color, use a white sealer and if you're painting it a dark color, apply a gray sealer., Saturate a dry rag in the sealer. Once the rag is saturated, drag it along the grain on the surface of your guitar. Make long movements and do not scrub in a single area with the sealer. Once the back of the guitar is sealed, turn the guitar over and finish sealing the front and sides.Once your rag looks dirty, dispose of it and use another, clean rag.  Let the sealer dry for an hour or two and come back and apply another even coat of sealer. The sealer will help the colored coats of paint adhere to the body of the guitar much easier. Continue adding more coats of sealer until you've covered the guitar three to five times in total.Remember to let the sealer dry in between each new application.  Feel over the sealer to make sure that it's no longer wet or sticky. Make sure that the guitar dries in a well-ventilated area so no one gets sick from the sealer's fumes., Using a 200 grit sandpaper, carefully sand over the shiny parts of the sealer. Make sure not to sand too hard or you may expose the wood grain underneath. If you do do this, simply reapply more coats of sealer to the guitar and allow it to dry before moving on. When you're done, the guitar should have a dull white or gray color., Typical guitar paint includes polyester, polyurethane, and nitrocellulose. Polyurethane and polyester will result in a harder, more plastic-feeling finish on your guitar while nitrocellulose is lighter and thinner. If you're unsure of what kind of paint to get, look for spray paint that's made specifically for guitars., Position the nozzle on the spray can 12 to 18 inches (30.48 to 45.72 cm) away from the body of the guitar. Remember to cover the edges of the guitar. Press down on the button on the spray can and go in long, sweeping back and forth motions across the body of the guitar., Touch the surface of the guitar to make sure that none of the paint transfers to your hand. The paint may still be sticky and you'll still be able to see the sealer under the basecoat that you just sprayed., Once the guitar is dry, flip it over and spray down the other side of the guitar. You should now have one solid basecoat of paint over the front and back of your guitar., Allow each coat of paint to dry for five minutes before applying the next coat. Continue flipping the guitar over so that the entire guitar gets even coverage. Continue to cover your guitar in coats of paint until the paint gets darker and richer. This could take anywhere from three to seven coats of paint., Once you're done laying down the base color for your guitar, you'll have to let the paint dry for another one or two days in a well-ventilated area. Once it's completely dry, you can move onto the next step. , Once the color coat is dry, run your fingers over the surface, sides, and back of the guitar to see if the paint is smooth. If the paint rises too high in some spots or has become bumpy, you should sand it down with a wet sandpaper. Saturate the sandpaper in water overnight, then work it along the rough parts of your guitar while it's still wet.Wet sandpaper will not scratch the surface of your guitar.  Clear lacquer paint will give your guitar a shiny finish over the paint. You can purchase clear lacquer paint at a home improvement store or online. Spray the clear lacquer the same way you sprayed the base coat, putting four separate coats of lacquer on the guitar and letting the paint dry in between sprays., Don't touch your guitar for three weeks as the paint dries. During this time the paint will cure and should be a rich solid color, but will be missing the polish that guitars typically have., Saturate a rag or cloth with car polish and work it on the surface of the guitar using small, circular motions. This should refine the shine in the guitar and make it more reflective. One you're done polishing the guitar, it should be shiny and reflective.	Remove your guitar strings and the screws in the body of the guitar. Remove the electrical components connecting the bridge and pickups. Heat the old paint with a hairdryer or heat gun. Lift off the old paint with a putty knife. Sand the body of the guitar. Fill any holes with an automotive filler. Sand the automotive filler so it lies flush with the guitar's surface. Dust the guitar with a dry rag. Lay the guitar down on a flat surface. Choose a wood sealer. Apply wood sealer to the guitar. Allow the guitar to dry and apply three to five coats of sealer. Let the sealer dry for three days. Sand off the shiny portions of the sealer. Choose a paint for your guitar. Spray your base coat onto the guitar. Let the paint dry for ten minutes. Flip the guitar over and spray the other side. Apply additional coats of base paint to the guitar. Let the paint dry. Sand the paint using 400-grit wet sandpaper. Spray clear lacquer onto the guitar. Let the guitar dry for three weeks. Polish the guitar with car polish.
Knead some clay in your hands until it turns soft. Place it onto a smooth surface, then roll it out into a thin sheet using an acrylic tube. How thick or thin you roll the clay out is up to you.  If you can't find an acrylic tube, you can use another smooth, cylindrical object, such as a rolling pin or fat pen. You can also use a pasta machine.; , You can leave the clay blank to make plain buttons. You can also make fancy buttons by adding texture. Press a stamp or texture mat on top of the clay to make an imprint, then peel it off.Background stamps with damask, scrolled, or floral designs work great for buttons.You can also use lace, doilies, or even draw your own design using a toothpick., This will give your buttons rounded, beveled edges. It will give them a more professional-looking finish. If you do not want rounded or beveled edges, you can skip this step.Be careful not to smooth your stamped designs.  You can do this using small cookie cutters or shaped clay butters. Press the tool into the clay, right over the plastic wrap, then pull it out. You can cut as many buttons as you'd like., Discard the plastic wrap. Crumple up the excess clay, and add it back to the brick or to your scrap clay bin., Smaller buttons only need two holes, but larger ones might need four. Make sure that all of the holes are centered and spaced evenly apart. You can poke them using skewers, toothpicks, knitting needles, or even plastic coffee stir sticks.  Wiggle toothpicks and skewers around a little to widen the holes.  Preheat your oven to the temperature specified on the clay's wrapper. Once the oven reaches the right temperature, place the buttons onto a foil-lined baking sheet. Put the baking sheet into the oven, then let the clay bake for the time specified on the label.  It does not matter how far apart or how close together the buttons are on the baking sheet. Each brand of clay is a little different, so the baking times and temperatures will vary.  Allow the buttons to cool first. Add some designs to the buttons using acrylic paint and a thin paintbrush. Let the paint dry, then apply some glaze using a paintbrush. Let the glaze dry completely before you use the buttons.  You can also apply glaze to unpainted buttons as well. If you added a stamped design, consider rubbing the paint off with a paper towel. This will reveal the clay's original color along the raised areas.Thick glaze may cover up the button holes. If this happens, run a toothpick or a skewer through the holes to clear them up.	Roll out a thin sheet of clay. Add some texture, if desired. Cover the clay with a sheet of plastic wrap. Cut the buttons out. Peel the plastic wrap and excess clay away. Poke two to four holes into each button. Bake the buttons in a preheated oven. Paint or glaze the buttons, if desired.
Take a strip of painter's tape and wrap it around your fingers with the sticky side facing outward. Dab the tape over the roller until it's completely free of lint.Removing lint from the roller with ensure that you have an even paint job.  Before you load your roller, you'll want to make sure that the paint doesn't have any lumps and is smooth as possible. To do this, make sure that you thoroughly stir the paint with a painter's mixing stick or paddle before transferring it to your paint tray or bucket., Once you've loaded your paint roller, you should wait for a minute to allow the paint to soak into the roller. This will make your paint job more even and smooth., For water based paint like latex, priming your roller may make it easier to load it. Saturate your roller under cold water from the faucet. Quickly roll the roller six or seven times in the air, then dry the rest of it off with paper towels.While priming your paint roller isn't necessary, it may make applying and loading your paint roller easier.	Remove lint from the roller with painter's tape. Mix the paint thoroughly. Let the roller sit for a minute after loading it. Prime the roller with water for water-based paints.
In order to get liquid soap to transform and form bubbles, you need the right mix of oils and a chemical called potassium hydroxide, also known as lye. This recipe yields six quarts of soap.You can get these ingredients at health stores, craft stores or online:   11 oz. potassium hydroxide flakes 33 oz. distilled water 24 oz. coconut oil 10 oz. olive oil 10 oz. castor oil 3 oz. jojoba oil  , When you work with lye, you need to wear safety gear and set up your work area properly. Plan to work in a well-ventilated room with good lighting so you can see what you're doing. You'll need the following supplies:   A crock pot Plastic or glass measuring bowls Kitchen scale Stick blender Gloves and protective goggles  , Weigh the oils and place them in the crock pot on low heat. Make sure you add the exact amount specified for each oil; adding more or less will throw off the recipe.  Put on your protective gear and make sure the window is open. Weigh the distilled water in a large bowl. Weigh the lye in a separate bowl, then add it to the water. Stir it constantly as you pour it in.Make sure you add the lye to the water, and not the other way around! Adding water to lye causes a dangerous reaction.  Pour the solution into the crockpot slowly, making sure none splashes back onto your skin. Use the stick blender to blend the lye with the oils to make sure they get thoroughly combined.   As you blend the liquids, the mixture will begin to thicken. Continue stirring until it reaches trace, which happens when the mixture gets thick enough that you can run a spoon through it and see the line in its wake. The mixture will continue to thicken into a paste., Continue cooking the mixture on low for about six hours, checking it every 30 minutes to break it up with a spoon. The paste is finished cooking when you can dissolve one ounce of paste in two ounces of boiling water and it comes out clear, rather than milky. If your test comes out milky, keep cooking.  You should have about a pound of paste after it's finished cooking; weight it just to make sure, then put it back in the crock pot. Add 33 oz. of distilled water to the paste to dilute it. It may take a few hours for the paste to get completely dissolved into the water.  Use your favorite essential oil and a natural food coloring to add a special scent and color to your soap once it has been diluted.  Pour the soap into jars you can seal, since you'll have a lot more than you can use at one time. Pour the soap you want to use into a soap bottle with a pump dispenser.	Gather ingredients. Get the right equipment. Heat the oils. Make the lye solution. Add the lye solution to the oils. Cook the paste. Dilute the paste. Add fragrance and color. Store the soap.
Wrap the yarn around your hook, bringing it around from the back to the front.   Only yarn over once. Yarn over around the tip of the hook, just below the hook opening and above the loop already on your hook.; , Slide the tip of the crochet hook into the stitch in which you want to make your half double crochet.   If you are following a crochet pattern, this stitch should be specified in the instructions. Only the tip of the hook needs to be inserted into the stitch. You do not need to draw any of your yarn loops through.  From the back of the piece, wrap yarn over the tip of the hook and into or just below the opening of the hook.   As before, only yarn over once and do so by wrapping the yarn from back to front.  Pull the yarn-over back through to the front of the stitch. This action should turn the yarn-over into a loop.   At this point, you should have a total of three loops on your hook. Note that the opening of the hook will need to latch onto the yarn-over as you pull it back through to the front. If you have difficulty sliding the hook back through, you may need to keep a little tension on the chain or row by pinching it between the thumb and forefinger of your opposite hand (the hand not holding onto the hook).  Wrap the yarn over the tip of the hook one time, working from back to front.   For this yarn-over, make sure that the opening of the hook catches the yarn as you wrap it around.  Drag the yarn-over through all three loops lying below it on your hook.   The yarn-over will need to lie in the opening of your hook and the loops will need to pass over the top of the hook completely. You may need to twist the hook so that the opening faces down as you draw it through the loops on your hook. Otherwise, the opening could accidentally latch onto one or more of the loops. This step completes one half double crochet.  Attach the yarn to your hook using a slipknot, then work a foundation chain that is one chain stitch longer than the number of half double crochet stitches called for in your first row.          For example, if your first row should have 15 half double crochets, your chain must have 16 chain stitches. If you need help making a slipknot on your hook or forming chain stitches, please check the "Tips" section of this article for further instruction.  When preparing to make a half double crochet, count three chain stitches in from your hook. You will skip over the first two chains and work the stitch into the third chain.          Note that the two stitches you skip will count as your "turning chain." A turning chain is a small chain made at the start of a row that raises the row height to the height of the stitch. Do not count the loop on your hook as a chain.  Make a half double crochet stitch into this third chain from your hook, following the instructions previously outlined in the HDC section of this article.          Yarn over the hook once, working from back to front. Insert the tip of the hook into the third stitch from the hook. Yarn over the hook once, working from back to front. Draw this yarn-over back to the stitch and to the front of the chain. There should be three loops on your hook by this point. Yarn over the hook once more, working from back to front. Draw this final yarn-over through all three loops on your hook. This action completes one half double crochet.  For your next half double crochet, you do not need to skip any chains. Work the half double crochet directly into the next stitch of your foundation chain.          Follow the same instructions as before:  Yarn over. Insert the hook into the next stitch. Yarn over. Draw the yarn-over to the front of the chain. Yarn over. Draw the yarn-over through all three loops on the hook.  To complete a full row of half double crochets, continue making half double crochets until you reach the last stitch of the chain. Do not skip any stitches; instead, work each half double crochet into the chain directly next to the stitch you just finished.          When you finish, there should be one less half double crochet stitch as there were chain stitches. For example, if your foundation chain had 16 stitches in it, you should be able to complete 15 half double crochets. This count includes the "turning chain" (the two skipped stitches) at the beginning of the row. Note that for most crochet pieces, you will need to flip the work over once you reach the end of the row before you begin working on the next row.  Work two chain stitches from the loop on your hook to complete this turning chain.   A turning chain exists for the purpose of building the row height up to the height of the stitch before working any actual stitch. This turning chain will count as one half double crochet stitch when you count your stitches at the end of the row. If you need help making chain stitches, please check the "Tips" section of this article for additional instruction.  Skip over the first half double crochet stitch of your previous row. When you work the stitch, you will do so in the second half double crochet from your previous row.   Note that the same concept applies if you are working a row of half double crochets off a row built with a different type of stitch. You will still need to make a turning chain and you will still need to skip over the stitch directly below that turning chain.  Make a standard half double crochet into the second stitch of the previous row. When you insert the hook into your stitch, insert it from front to back and make sure that it goes through the top two loops of the previous row's stitch.   Yarn over from back to front. Insert the hook into the top two loops of the second stitch from the previous row. Yarn over from back to front. Draw this yarn-over back to the front of your row, creating a total of three loops on your hook. Yarn over from back to front. Draw this yarn-over through all three loops on your hook to complete the half double crochet.  To complete a full row of half double crochet, work one half double crochet into the top two loops of each stitch from the previous row. Continue this step until you reach the end of the row.   Again, use the steps outlined for a basic half double crochet:  Yarn over. Insert the hook into the next stitch. Yarn over. Draw the yarn-over to the front of the row. Yarn over. Draw the yarn-over through all three loops on your hook.   Do not skip any other stitches as you work your way across the row. You will usually need to flip the work over if you plan on making another row after this one. Any additional rows of half double crochet should be completed using the same steps outlined here.	Yarn over. Insert the hook into the stitch. Yarn over. Draw up another loop. Yarn over. Draw through all three loops on the hook. Create a foundation chain. Skip the first two chain stitches. Work a half double crochet. Work another half double crochet. Repeat across the chain. Create a turning chain. Skip a stitch. Work a half double crochet into the next stitch. Repeat across the row.
This can be done in the following ways.   If you haven't driven your car recently then the engine is most likely cold. Start your vehicle as usual and keep the engine running for a few minutes. This should warm up the engine to its normal operating temperature; however you should be careful not to overheat the engine by keeping it started for too long. Usually keeping the engine started for 20 minutes is sufficient. Turn off the car engine and allow the engine to cool if you have recently taken your car for a drive. If the engine is hot, it should be given approximately 1 hour to rest before you do a compression test on it. If you can't start the car engine then just continue with the test anyway. Even though you won't be able to test the engine's performance accurately you will still be able to diagnose that the engine is faulty due to its internal compression if you get a low reading.; ,, This will disable the fuel system so fuel will not be injected into the cylinders.  This will disable the ignition system since the ignition coil pack will be unable to create and distribute the spark from the spark plug.  Handle the spark plugs cautiously since the ceramic insulator of a spark plug can break or malfunction if not handled delicately.  Don't use any additional tools to tighten the compression gauge, you should only use hand force.  The needle on the pressure gauge will rise and once the needle has risen to its maximum reading your helper should stop the engine. This maximum reading is the maximum compression value for the first cylinder that you have just tested.	Bring the engine to its normal running temperature. Switch off the engine completely before beginning the test.  , Remove the fuel pump relay. Disconnect the electrical connection from the ignition coil pack. Disconnect the wires for each spark plug then remove the spark plugs. Put the engine compression gauge into the first cylinder's spark plug hole (this is the hole that is nearest to the drive belt). Ask a helper to crank the engine over continuously. Repeat the engine compression test for the other cylinders until you have tested all of the cylinders on your engine.
You can read the book quietly to yourself, or you can read it aloud to your friends and family. If you have small children, have them work on an art project related to the story when you are done reading.For example:   If you just read The Very Hungry Caterpillar, you can have the kids made a "next" page in the story by gluing pieces of colored paper onto printer paper. If you read The Rainbow Fish, have the kids cut a fish out of purple or blue paper, and then decorate it using glitter glue. If it's dark, don't fret. Light a candle, and get cozy with a blanket and your favorite book.  If it's dark, light a candle or two. Get out a sheet of paper and a pen or pencil, and try one of the following:   Write a letter to a relative. Write a list. The list can be on anything, from shopping lists to foods that are blue. Play word-games like Hangman or Mad Libs. If you don't like to write, draw a picture instead.  If it is fully charged, you should be able to watch at least 3 hours of movies. To save battery power, try to keep the screen as dim as possible, and close any apps that you are not using.  If you know how to play an instrument, you can practice a song that you have been learning, or you can teach yourself a new one.   If you are feeling restless, try singing or dancing along to your favorite songs.  This is a great way to pass time. Not only will you let your creativity soar, but you'll also have something beautiful to show off by the time the powder gets back. Even if you are not a crafter, you might want to consider this. You might find a new hobby for yourself or discover a hidden talent. Listed below are some simple craft ideas to get you started:Do some drawing or coloring. If you own some paints and a canvas, you can also try painting instead. Make some crafty items, such as yarn dolls or duct tape wallets. Try knitting, crochet, or embroidery. A simple scarf or potholder will usually take 2 to 3 hours. Make something out of clay or play-doh.	Read a book. Do some writing.Much like reading, writing can help pass time. Watch movies on a portable DVD player. Listen to or play some music.If you have a portable music player, you can pass the time by listening to your favorite songs. Get crafty.
Visit a local junkyard to check out the oldest cars that are still intact, which might make good candidates. Several Rat-Rodding websites also exist with links to possibilities.Look for one that is not especially rusted, and has its essential shape is still intact. Typically, Rats are made from American cars, often pick-ups, manufactured pre-1960. Popular models for Rat Rods include:   Mid-century Chevrolet pick-up trucks '30s-era Fords, esp. the "Model A" Early Chrysler hemi engines are popular, as well as flathead V-8s; , To strip it down and start fresh, that means you'll need to remove all the seats, fixtures and other accessories from the car. Typically, cars used for Rat Rods are in pretty bad shape to begin with, in terms of the interior, making this step somewhat necessary.  Position a container under the drain cock, or remove one of the fuel lines and collect any gas remaining in the gas tank. This is an essential step in prepping the car for Rodding, as you're going to be doing a lot of welding and any remaining traces of gasoline will be dangerous. Keep a fire extinguisher ready in your shop or garage at all times while you're working.  Measure and mark where you want the vehicle's new axles and wheels to go, then cut the frame up to the desired length using a reciprocating saw. Since a Rat Rod is mostly about the look of the car, you'll mostly be flying by the seat of your pants anyway.   It's usually common to shorten the rear of the vehicle somewhat to accommodate the axle and eliminate any elements, such as roofs or hoods, that you no longer want. Make any cuts to accommodate the drivetrain.  It's also possible to build your own frame, using about 20 feet (6.1 m) of rectangular 2x4 steel tubing in the early stages, cut into two equal sections. Weld them together, patterned like a ladder, as square and as level as possible. Use one cross member toward the front, one in the back, and a crossing pattern in the middle to support the body. Match the width of the frame to the body you intend to use.  Among Rat-Rodders, it's a common goal to try to keep the total price-tag somewhere under $3,000 as a badge of your ability to work with limited materials. If you're up for a challenge, put your skills and your resourcefulness to the test and try to keep the project as cheap as possible by scrounging for a mishmash of parts in the junkyard, or on eBay., You can customize your suspension using the latest in modern suspension technology, making the Rat a hybrid of old and new. Having a Model A that turns on a rail? Yes, please.   Start by measuring the rear width or rear body width and finding axles of the appropriate size. The axle should be somewhat longer than the width, and Leaf Spring rear axles are typically popular options because of their possibility for modification. Anything from the 60s and 70s is also popular, depending on the price. Install coil springs in a side-to-side or parallel pattern by welding the upper mounts on the cross member in the rear and the lower mounts to the axle housing. To keep it cheap, use a straight axle in the front, salvaged or new. The suspension from a Mustang II/ Pinto, AMC Pacer or Corvair are popular and useful choices, though ready-to-weld suspension kits are also available, sometimes for as little as a few hundred bucks, complete with frame and axle brackets, as well as template guides. It's a good investment, if you need new parts.  Old truck bodies are by far the most popular choice, but you can also make use of more modern fiberglass, which is forgiving and easy to work with. Customize your body and make the rod you want, cutting it for the crude-style and swagger you want from a good Rat Rod, then weld it to the frame., try to remember: a Rat Rod is a semi-legal and wonky glorified go-kart, so don't break the bank with the drive train. An old Chevy 350 or a Ford 302 are both super-common and usually-cheap options that you could get and rebuild however you want. Just get the thing running. The great thing about hot-rodding is that if you want to use an engine that really doesn't fit in the body, there's nothing stopping you from doing it but your own creativity and ingenuity. Make it fit. Leave the hood off and do what you want.   You might consider selling the block from the car you got initially, especially if the heads are worn out, then using the extra money you got from the sale to get something from the same era that actually runs. Install any new starters or alternators as you install the engine into the frame. Make sure you have removed as much grease as you can from the engine before installing, then install the transmission and mount the drive shaft and the radiator. Hook up the steering linkage and install the pedals, welding any additional joints that will be necessary to keep the thing together.  You'll be close to running at this point, but you'll still need to install the brakes and tires to try to make the Rod as safe as possible. It might not be street legal, eventually, but you'll have to make the thing stop. Put in a seat, or cut up a couch and use something bootleg and hilarious. Rat Rods are amenable to any weird ideas you've got about cars aesthetically. Have fun with it!  , Rat Rods will often go without typical car accessories. Windows, covered seats, and even doors are purely optional. Keep your tools handy so that you can continue to tweak your rat rod even after you've taken it out for its first ride. Customize it creatively.  Some Rat Rodders like to leave the rusty exterior basically as-is, to show how tough and lasting the original was and remains to be. If you want a slightly more polished look, but want to retain some of the grit, go for a matte base coat with some brownish spray highlights that might resemble rust, but also seal the exterior and protect it some.  Popular at parades and fairs, Rat Rods styled with unique themes will often draw a crowd. Using unusual objects instead of a steering wheel, for example, might be a fun project that'll get people chuckling. Check out other Rat Rods for inspiration and do something unique and fun to make it worth your while.  Unlike hot rods, rat rods are customized cars that are not meant to resemble an antiquated original. Spice up your vehicle with odd adjustments and a colorful body, or dramatically alter the original frame to create an entirely new shape.	Procure an old car. Remove all interior elements from the car. Drain all gasoline from the gas tank. Size the frame however you want it. Improvise. Aim to keep it under $3,000. Install new axles, shocks and suspension system. Mount the body on the frame. Rebuild the existing engine, or install a new engine. Finish the job. Mount a windshield, side-view mirrors, and the rear-view mirror as necessary. Paint the body of the rat rod using matte or spray paint. Give it a theme. Be original.
The stem is essential for allowing the berries to be included in any floral arrangement.; , This allows for maximum surface to uptake water.  Let stand for several hours.  The box will prevent the spray going over other surfaces.  Be sure to get all of the berries and coat all surfaces evenly.  This also gives additional preservation to the berries. Spray two layers, allowing for drying in between.  Once the sprays have dried properly, the berries are now ready to be included as part of your floral arrangement.	Cut the berries with plenty of stem left intact. Cut the stems at an angle. Stand the stems in a vase or container of warm water. Place the vase or container holding the berries on their stems inside an upended box. Spray the berries with hair spray. Use a polyurethane spray varnish if you also want gloss. Arrange the berries.
For this project you’ll need a fine mesh strainer, 2/3 cup of quinoa seeds, a bowl, water, a tray or plate, cloth, and a sealed glass container or plastic bag. , You need to wash the quinoa seeds to remove the soapy outer coating, which is known as saponin. Quinoa should always be rinsed prior to sprouting and cooking.  Quinoa is small, so you need to make sure you don’t lose any grains. After rinsing the saponin from the quinoa, use a fine-mesh strainer to collect the rinsed quinoa while draining the soapy water into the sink. Transfer the quinoa to a seed sprouter or into a second bowl.  If you have a seed sprouter, you can transfer your quinoa to that at this time.	Gather your supplies. Rinse the quinoa seeds in a bowl. Use a fine mesh strainer to gather your quinoa. Add approximately two-thirds of a cup (approximately 113 grams) of quinoa seed to a second bowl.
Swamp coolers are rated by how much air the cooler can move, and is measured in cubic feet per minute (CFM).  Multiply this figure by the height of your ceilings. Divide that number by 2 (120 for European measurements). The result is the CFM rating for the evaporative cooler you need. For example: If you have a 1,500 square foot home with 8 foot (2.4 m) ceilings:  1,500 square feet x 8 feet (2.4 m). ceilings = 12,000 ÷ 2 = 6,000 CFM. You need a unit rated at 6,000 CFM or higher.   Example 2, in CMS (cubic meters per second): If you have a 140m2 home with 3m ceilings:  140m2 x 3m ceiling = 420 ÷ 120 = 3.5 centimeters (1.4 in). You need a unit rated at 3.5 centimeters (1.4 in) or higher.	Calculate your CFM rating. Use this formula to calculate the CFM needed to cool your home:   Determine the area of the space you want to cool.
You want to make sure your car is in the best shape possible during the winter. You don’t want to break down when it’s snowing or below zero. That can be stressful! Take your car to the mechanic for a checkup, or do your own maintenance on your car.Common things that break during the winter include hoses, belts, water pumps, and spark plug wires. You should also check the tire pressure.  Dead batteries are not a good thing to wake up to on a cold morning. Another thing that you should check at the start of the winter is your battery. Old batteries may give out in the cold, or the charging system may not be working correctly. While you are checking the other parts of the car, you should check your battery.If you need to get a new battery, make sure it is powerful enough to start your car in the winter. During the winter, your car will have more difficulty starting than in the summer.  Antifreeze is important to keep your car running during the winter. Most cars will do best with a mixture of water and antifreeze. For most winter weather, 60 percent antifreeze and 40 perfect water will be fine. In extreme winter conditions, use 70 percent antifreeze and 30 percent water. This helps keep the engine cool while having a low freezing point.Check your manual for specific antifreeze type recommendations.  Having your wipers going out while on the road is no fun. If you live in an area with a lot of ice and snow, you should put winter wipers on your car. These wipers are heavy and are specially made to keep ice from collecting on the wipers.Before you turn off the car, make sure to turn off the wipers. Your blades can freeze on the windshield, which can mess up the motor of the wipers when you try to use them again.  If you live in an area where it snows often every year, you put snow tires on your car. Snow tires can be difficult to put on your car, so permanently mount them on steel rims that a tire shop can easily put on your car in winter.You can store the tires during the winter, or many tire shops will store the tires and rims for you.  Snow and icy conditions can make seeing out of your windshield difficult. If you drive behind a car, you may also get salt and road grime sprayed on your windshield. You need to put washer fluid in your car that is made for snow and below freezing temperatures.Winter formulas of washer fluid help remove snow and ice and doesn’t freeze.	Have your car serviced. Check your battery. Check the antifreeze. Replace your wipers. Buy snow tires. Fill up your windshield washer fluid.
The best type of lid to work with is the kind that comes from a yogurt, butter, or margarine container. Make sure that the lid is clean and dry.  Turn the lid over so that the inside is facing you. Fill the bottom with a thick layer of clear school glue.Make sure that there aren't any gaps or holes in the glue, or your suncatcher will fall apart.It may seem as though you are using more glue than necessary, but clear glue tends to shrink a lot as it dries.Do not use a clear, industrial-strength glue for this; you want to be able to remove the suncatcher from the lid when you are done. White school glue may also be used, but your finished suncatcher may look cloudy and not sparkle as much., You can arrange them randomly or in a pattern, but make sure that you fill the entire bottom of the lid in an even layer. To make a more interesting looking suncatcher, experiment with different sizes and colors.Make sure that the flat size of the gems is facing down.  Do not skimp on the glue during this step; this is what will hold your suncatcher together. Make sure that you fill all of the cracks between the gems, and don't worry if the glue covers the gems; the glue will dry clear., If it tends to get very dusty where you live, consider placing a cardboard box over the lid to keep the glue clean and dust-free.  Turn the suncatcher over, so that the back is facing you, and let it finish drying., Find an area near the edge of the suncatcher where the glue is thick. Thread some clear string through a needle, then push the needle through the glue.Tie the ends of the string into a loop.  You can hang the suncatcher from a suction cup that has a hook on it, or you can hang it from the window latch.Do not let this suncatcher get wet. The glue will dissolve.	Find a plastic lid. Spread a thick layer of clear school glue over the bottom of the lid. Arrange glass, flat-backed gems in the lid. Fill the lid the rest of the way with clear school glue. Wait 2 to 4 days for the glue to dry.Do not disturb the suncatcher during this time. Carefully peel the lid off of the suncatcher. Thread some clear through through a thick part of your suncatcher with a needle. Hang the suncatcher indoors in front of a window.
Keeping your back straight and your posture neutral will allow your diaphragm and lungs to expand properly as well as encourage air flow. Since your singing power originates in the diaphragm, making a point of relaxing the rest of the body will help you refocus your attention on the parts of the body that matter.   Make a special effort to relax your stomach. Resist the urge to hold or suck it in, as this will make your breathing unnatural. Using your thumb, push the larynx from side to side gently, allowing your vocal chords to loosen, thereby putting less stress on them when you begin to sing.  The diaphragm is a muscle beneath the lungs that contracts whenever you breathe in, allowing your lungs to expand into that space. Expelling air is therefore a question of allowing the diaphragm to relax in controlled, gradual manner. To test what it feels like to breathe through your diaphragm, bend over at the waist and sing. Notice the feeling in your stomach and the sound that you create.   Don't ever breathe in through your nose; it will make it harder to reach high notes.  Make nonsense sounds (ex. expelling air to forcibly flap your lips by and create a b-b-b-b-b or p-p-p-p-p sound, making a prolonged "shhhhh" sound, and so on), covering different consonants and vowels to engage different facial muscles. This produces a richer, less strained sound. (When you blow up a balloon, it is much easier to stretch the balloon before blowing it up; your vocal chords function in much the same way.)  , Covering territory you're already comfortable with will continue to warm up your voice before you try to train it to do anything new. Consider choosing a song that has a few notes slightly above your usual range and make these your goal.  Remember that your vocal chords are delicate membranes and must be eased into any new techniques.  As you sing the note, press your lower belly in but keep your upper belly out; this is called a “lower belly boost.” Drop your lower jaw dramatically but keep your mouth opened narrowly. Bend your knees slightly to make yourself feel like you're moving downwards as your voice goes up. Try to minimize the height to which you lift your larynx up as you increase your pitch; though this is what people naturally do when raising their voices, this strains your throat and can cause your voice to crack. Monitor this by placing your fingers above your larynx while you sing and adjusting your technique to keep the larynx down.   Don’t look up while you sing high notes; keep your vision directly in front of you to avoid bending your throat and straining the sound. Sticking your tongue forward may help give the high notes a richer sound.  Don't try to force yourself into a much higher register too quickly; there are often serious consequences when you do. Remember to always drink water before a performance or practice, which will keep your voice steady. Keep one near you for emergencies as well.  To strengthen your singing voice, make good posture a habit, not a mode you switch into.; , Take up running or practise interval training to increase your lung strength and capacity.  Make funny faces, stretch your mouth and tongue in all directions, yawn to open the back of the throat, and loosen your jaw until you're able to push or pull on it with your hand. These exercises will help you shape and perfect the sound as it comes out of your mouth.	Sit or stand up straight with your muscles relaxed. Breathe from your diaphragm. Warm up before starting to sing. Start with songs that are in your vocal range. Practice scales, gradually increasing the pitch each time. Train your body to hit the high notes. Always remember to not strain your voice. Improve your posture. Get in shape. Develop facial flexibility.
Allow the fabric to absorb the soap and water without over-soaking the fabric (or it will become heavy and too soggy to create bubbles).    Instruct children to gently blow in a steady stream to achieve a constant, consistent flow of bubbles. If the fabric becomes too saturated with bubble mixture, remove it, wring out and replace.  Blow as many bubbles as you wish, adding more bubble mixture if needed.	Dip the fabric end of the bubble maker into the soapy water mixture. Blow on the other end of the bottle (the mouth) and watch the bubble snake emerge. Finished.
The marijuana plant’s resin can be difficult to wash off. Wearing disposable rubber gloves will protect your hands from its sticky buds., Marijuana plants are fragile and can be sensitive to rough treatment. Trimming your plant must be done carefully. Sharp sewing shears or a sharp kitchen knife should be adequate to trim your plant.Gardening shears are also commonly used to trim marijuana.Large fan leaves can be plucked with your fingers, as well as clipped with scissors or shears.  You should not simply discard the leaves you trimmed. They can be used to make marijuana foodstuffs or hashish. So before trimming your marijuana plants, set three cookie sheets or other wide containers near the plants you’ll be trimming. On one sheet, set untrimmed buds. On the second sheet, set newly trimmed buds. And on the last sheet, set the leaves and other plant matter you trim from the plant., The top of your marijuana plant should have a cluster of white hairs sticking out the top of it. These are the plant’s pistils, or reproductive organs. As the plant ages, these pistils will change from white to brown. When about 70% of the pistils have darkened to a reddish brown, your plant is ready for harvest., Most people trim their marijuana plants before drying them. This is known as a “wet trim.” A wet trim makes it easier to separate leaves from buds, and produces better-looking buds. However, some people trim the plants after the buds of the plant have dried. This is known as a “dry trim.” This is the preferred method of trimming in a low-humidity environment, since the leaves will slow the drying process and you want the buds to dry slowly.	Wear gloves. Use the right tools. Arrange a system to separate your trimmings. Harvest your plant at the appropriate time. Decide whether to wet trim or dry trim.
These tend to offer a snug fit and are available anywhere from H&M to dance apparel stores. A jersey material will work well once you accessorize the look.You could also wear a long-sleeved black shirt. Try to get a V-neck or scoop-neck style shirt that fits closely around your body. Tuck the shirt into your pants to make your look more seamless.; , These should fit you snugly. Ideally, the material will be leather; however, you can still rock the Black Widow look with black jeans.  The boots should be black, have three buckles that wrap around the leg at three different heights, and have either a low or wedge heel.  The jacket should have a front zipper and fit you tightly. A leather jacket will most closely resemble Black Widow’s look, but a pleather or suede material will also work.  Finding pre-made bullet bracelets will not be an easy task, since they are an unusual item. However, you can create your own a number of different ways:   Purchase a bullet belt from an online retailer like Amazon or from a costume store. Cut it so that it is small enough to fit around your wrist, and superglue this smaller section of the belt to a black bangle bracelet. You will need 2 bullet bracelets, one for each wrist.Spray-paint crayons black and gold. The coloring should be gold from the pointy, coloring end of the crayon to the middle and black from the middle to the flat top. Let the paint dry and superglue the crayons to two bangle bracelets. Similarly-shaped items, like toy drop whistles, will also work well when painted.  You can buy gold Crayola crayons in bulk from an online retailer like Amazon. This way, you only have to paint half the crayon black.  This is an accessory that adds to Black Widow’s edgy, unique style. The thigh holster should wrap around your hips and will ideally have three pouches, as in the movie. You can find a thigh holster online by shopping for SWAT or Tomb Raider costumes at stores like Spirit Halloween.   You can also look up holsters at an army supply store like OPSGEAR or Army Surplus World. Alternatively, you could superglue a black cell phone pouch to a black heavy-duty strap and tie the strap around your thigh.  You can purchase a prop gun online from a store like Replica Airguns or from a costume store. A cheaper option would be to purchase a toy gun - even a water gun - and paint it black., In addition to the thigh holster, Black Widow wears a belt that sits higher on the waist. This belt is broad, made of cloth, and has a plain silver quick release buckle in the center.Amazon sells heavy duty law enforcement belts that resemble the one worn by Black Widow, but a regular military-looking belt will do.  You can find a close approximation to the black, leather biker gloves worn by Black Widow at most stores which sell motorcycle accessories. A cheaper option would be to wear cloth fingerless gloves., Online retailers like WigIsFashion or wigs.com sell red wigs for around $60. Choose a style that is slightly wavy so as to most closely resemble Black Widow., While more time-consuming and permanent than wearing a wig, dyeing your hair can look more realistic. Black Widow’s hair color is a burnt red, so aim to find a dye that is not too flashy - the more natural the color looks, the more believable your costume will be.A semi-permanent dye, which you can buy at a retailer like Sally Beauty, is a good option if you want to wear the costume multiple times in the span of a few days or if you want a temporary change of look, as it will last you three to six weeks but won’t flake., Black Widow’s wears minimal makeup, so all you have to do to get the right lip color is apply a medium pinkish or peach lipstick. Try to choose a lip color that subtly enhances your own rather than one that is too bright or that looks unnatural.  Black Widow doesn't wear much makeup, but a generous amount of mascara does make her eyes stand out. Double-coat your lashes or add fake eyelashes to enhance your Black Widow look.   Line your eyes with black eyeliner for even more definition.There are several tutorials on YouTube that you could use to guide your eye makeup application - simply look up “Black Widow makeup” to get the most relevant results.	Find a long-sleeved bodysuit or leotard. Wear a pair of black skinny jeans or leggings. Wear knee-length leather boots. Complete the look with a black moto jacket. Create bullet bracelets. Find a thigh holster. Get a fake gun. Wear a buckled belt. Add fingerless gloves to complete your look. Try on a red wig. Dye your hair. Apply lipstick. Put on mascara.
The more mild your soap is, the less likely it is to have a harmful effect on your plants. Stay away from anti-bacterial, scented, and other specialized soaps.  Combine the soap and water using your hands or a large spoon.  You may not be able to fit all of the solution into a bottle, but you should use the largest bottle you can find to make use of as much of the solution as possible.  Spray a small section of the infested plant with the solution and monitor it throughout the course of a day. If it does not wilt or change color, the solution is likely safe.  Cover the top and undersides of leaves, focusing on the areas that seem the most overcome. This spray works by paralyzing insects, making them unable to eat.  Since this pesticide is fairly diluted, continued application is the only way to ensure that the infestation ends.	Opt for a mild liquid dish-washing soap. Mix a few teaspoons (10 to 15 milliliters) of your selected soap into 1 gallon (4 liters) of water. Pour the solution into a large squirt bottle. Test the mixture on your plants. Spray the entire plant. Continue to spray your plants every two to three days for the next two weeks.
Starting with tropical grasses or leaves gives you a base for the rest of your flowers. Big tropical leaves like ginger foliage or virions are a great option for this.Keep in mind that your bouquet will need to match the size of your greenery, so if you’re aiming for a small bouquet, use less greenery, or smaller leaves.  For a loose bouquet, you’ll want to build it from back to front. This prevents any of your flowers from getting lost in the arrangement., You’ll want to place your smaller flowers in bunches of threes. Generally it’s best to place them in the center, and to each side of the larger blooms., You can use smaller flowers up front and near the bottom of the bouquet – this allows them to be seen and also doesn’t overwhelm the bouquet in any one spot., To keep the bouquet together, you can loosely tie fabric around your stems. Don’t wrap them with wire, as this will give you a tighter look and will ruin the arrangement. Once your loose bouquet is finished, you can use it however you like - in a vase in your own home, as a hostess gift if you're attending a party at someone else's home, or even for a wedding.	Start with a base of greenery. Place your largest flower in front of the greenery. Frame the larger flowers with smaller flowers. Vary the heights. Tie with fabric.
Decide on your route before you depart on your trip, even if it’s just across town. Asking for directions can tip off a would-be carjacker that you are lost and/or not paying attention to your surroundings. Plan ahead of time which route you will take and any stops you may need to make along the way.Choose the most direct routes possible, and mix up your routine so that you are not a predictable target for criminals., Avoid high crime areas, rural areas with less populated roads, and congested traffic spots.Look for a navigation app with the safety feature of avoiding high crime spots.If you notice a lot of cars in disrepair, graffiti, liquor stores, check-cashing stores, or tire skid marks on the street, you may be in a bad neighborhood., According to the National Crime Victimization survey, 25% of all carjackings happen in parking lots, parking garages or near commercial areas. Park in a spot close to the building’s main entrance and under a lot of light,avoiding areas that are visually obstructed by walls or large plants.Don’t sit in the car and go through receipts or have a conversation on the phone or with your child in the backseat. Get in, lock the doors and go.   Don’t put your seatbelt on while pulling out of a space. If something happens, you may need to get out of your car quickly. Instead, belt yourself as soon as you are out of the space and ready to drive.In parking garages, park close to the exit and back into the space. It’s easier to drive forwards than backwards in an emergency., Keep a GPS system in your car or a GPS app on your phone in case you get lost.Always have a charged cell phone with you. Even if it is not under a service contract, you can still use it to call 911 if necessary. Just keep in mind that if you do not have a wireless provider and your call with an emergency operator gets disconnected, you will have to call back because they cannot call you.	Plan your routes. Avoid trouble spots and driving in unfamiliar areas. Take extra care when parking in commercial areas. Have a cell phone or radio communication on you at all times.
Remember that this is going to be outside with a bunch of hot sweaty and smelly people so before you go take a shower, you're probably going to want another one when you get home.; , Almost all amphitheaters let you bring in at least one sealed bottle of water. Some people have entered with a gallon jug of water because it was sealed.  If you burn easily bring sunscreen and don't wear black clothes or long sleeves, especially in the summer. People wearing long sleeves have been known to beg friends for cash to buy a shirt because it gets so hot.  Mosh pits can get pretty dangerous and they form fast. Keep watching the area around you. A mosh pit is pretty scary if you've never been in one before or if you just don't like being in them. The area around them for a good 15–20 yards (13.7–18.3 m) can also be bad to stand in as you could get hit or trampled of people wanting to be in it. If one forms around you and you have to get out, get out fast and don't worry about your blanket, trying to get it will more than likely end up in you getting your head stepped on.  If it rains enjoy it as it really cools you down.  Try not to get too close to the front of the stage. Seeing as that's where most people go, it's way hotter there and that's where mosh pits like to form and you will get hurt it's also very crowded.  Rather than blowing your money on that $10.00 cheeseburger, save it for a shirt. If you don't have enough for a shirt, you could possibly buy one in the parking lot for about $10.00. Some people had the experience of buying t-shirts for $4 each, instead of the usual $20.00 because they waited to buy them. But be aware that if you wait too long for that price to go down, you might not get the shirt that you wanted: as t-shirts sometimes sell out very quickly.  Check online or phone to see if the venue allows backpacks. Concerts sometimes have free stuff and you don't want to carry it around all day. You also might bring a notepad and a disposable camera (outdoor venues usually let you bring one) to get pictures with bands you might be able to meet because wouldn't it suck to meet a great band with no paper for them to sign and no camera with which to get a photograph?  , It's rude to other people who may be enjoying the band - it makes them hate you. People can be very touchy about the musicians they like.	Take care of personal hygiene. Bring water. Bring sunblock. Be vigilant for mosh pits. Check the weather. Don't stand too close. Buy a shirt. Bring a backpack. If a band you hate is performing, don't scream at them to get off the stage, or that they need to die.
Use a giant hole punch to punch out large circles.   Consider having an assortment of an even number of newspaper and cardstock circles on hand before you start to design.; , You could create a pattern where every other circle is newspaper followed by a cardstock circle or you could randomly add newspaper––get creative!  , Use enough glue without saturating the circles (too much and the Mod Podge could bleed through).	Create several giant newspaper and cardstock circles. Visualize the design of circles on the lampshade before adding glue. Glue the circles directly onto the lampshade using Mod Podge. Allow the lampshade to dry completely before use.
The reason why most people get stage fright is fearing they're gonna make a mistake. So, if you know your song inside and out, the anxiety should go down. Make sure you choose a song that fits your vocal range (you could add a note out of your range to wow your audience!) But, don't strain your throat!; , This article is based on singing (but some of these tips apply for all). Sing a scale in your range and go from there. When you're in public you can hum to warm up your voice. Humming can be used if you're speaking also and is a great substitute for singing your scales. Also, if your song doesn't go in a scale order or if you want a challenge, try singing "do, me, so, ti, re, ti, so, me, do" and etc. Or you can practice dynamics with your voice and etc.  Make sure you don't drink milk this day. It clogs up your throat. Instead, drink water. Make sure you warm up and run through your song a few times (don't do it too much because you will strain your throat!). While waiting to perform, breathe slowly. Don't talk to anyone who will distract you or let you down. Do calm exercises like yoga, deep breathing, and etc. Thirty seconds or so before you go on. Drink a small gulp of water and stay quiet. You might be REALLY nervous. When you perform, look slightly above the audience, judges, and etc. So you'll be performing to the wall!  , While performing or practicing, if you make mistakes then don't be hard on yourself. Take it easy. If you give that mistakes too much of attention its most likely going to drive you to make more mistakes. So when you make a mistake while you are performing...  Accept that you made a mistake. Move on.  As clichéd as this is, have fun! You're doing something you love! Put your heart into it! But if you mess up, that's ok. Everybody makes mistakes. If you stay calm about it. They might not have noticed. If your voice cracked, it's not the end of the world!	Practice Makes Perfect. Warm Up. The big day!, Its ok to make mistakes. Have fun!

How many people will be sheltering in your home during the power outage? How many pets will you be caring for during the power outage? Do you have infants? Does anyone in your household, including pets, take medications? Does anyone in your household require special medical equipment, such as an oxygen concentrator? Do you have cold-blooded pets, such as snakes or lizards, that rely on a heat source to survive? Do you have a heat source that does not require electricity, such as a wood stove? Do you have an alternative power source, such as a generator?; ,   If you have a woodstove or fireplace, make sure it is in good working condition. Have the chimney cleaned. Stock up on dry firewood and kindling. Consider purchasing a portable propane or kerosene heater that is meant for indoor use. Make sure you have plenty of fuel for the heater. Always use a battery-powered carbon monoxide detector when using an alternative heat source.    You will need about one gallon of water for each adult, child, and pet per day. Food should not require cooking or refrigeration, and should provide balanced nutrition. ,,,,,,	Assess your needs. Prepare a safe alternative heat source. Stock up on enough food and water to last 1 to 2 weeks. Stock up on medications.  , Stock up on other items unique to your household such as:   Diapers Baby formula Cat litter  , Purchase fresh fuel for your generator, if you have one.  , Purchase a backup power source for medical devices.  , Stock up on fresh batteries for flashlights.  , Purchase a battery-powered or hand-crank powered radio.  , Charge your cell phones and other devices.
With every beat of the music, you'll pop a shoulder. "Pop" here meaning move it up and out to the side quickly. The rest of your body should sort of flow with each pop -- it's not only your shoulders that are moving.   You're sort of moving your shoulders in arch, starting from the inside and going out. When you pop your left shoulder, your right hip should jut out. The hips should follow behind the shoulder by just a split second.  If you're popping your left shoulder first, go left, right, left. Then pop right, left, right. If you're working with music that's 4/4, you'll be using the half-beats, or the and of 1 and 2 (for example).   Start going faster and faster. Electronic dance music can be really, really, fast and keeping time is absolutely imperative.  When you pop your shoulders, your arms should be bent at the elbows, with your forearms and hands going toward the other direction. So when you pop left, through your arms right. When you pop right, throw your arms left. Keep your hands in a loose fist.   When you pop a shoulder, it moves up a bit. To exaggerate this, move the other shoulder down a bit. When you add in your arms, this looks especially good and loosens you up. Your arms will then be at slightly different levels.  Keeping the same basics (popping shoulders and opposite arms), get creative. Move your arms to shoulder level or even above your head. Add in a hand movement on the beats (dirt off your shoulder, maybe?) to jazz it up. It's still the Harlem Shake!   When you're working with music that's 4/4 (as most music is), alternate between working in threes (hitting pop, pop, pop on 1 and 2, 3 and 4), and working in twos (hitting pop, pop on 5, 6). So you might pop your shoulders five times on 1, and, 2, 3, 4 and then five more times on 5, and, 6, 7, 8.  The Harlem Shake is a dance move that goes back to the 80s -- it's not just some recent YouTube phenomenon, despite what your friends may tell you. The video craze just involves dancing wildly and has nothing to do with this dance move.   However, if you want to get creative, do the Harlem Shake while you're making a Harlem Shake video. Only a few people will understand what you're doing, but they'll appreciate it!	Alternate popping shoulders, left and right. Do it in threes. Start using your arms. Add personality to it. Know that this is different than the video craze.
Try to meet the director and tell them about your interests, training and desires.; , You don't necessarily need to love a character to play them well.  They take more effort and more memorizing, and if you are a beginner, it might be too much for you to handle. Many actresses started small, but were noticed in minor roles by talent scouts.  It might be helpful to you later, if you get either of the parts.  This will also tell you how long you have to practice.  Here are some good questions.   Do you need to have a song or monologue prepared? How long will the audition take? What roles are available? Will there be accompaniment or do you have to bring in a karaoke CD?  , Don't sing anything like rap or a rock song because it is a major turnoff for a casting director (unless that is what they're looking for.) If the show is something energetic such as Legally Blonde the Musical, you'll want to do an upbeat musical theatre song, not a ballad. Usually, they'll ask for about 16 measures (they can be 16 measures in a row that show off your range the best). Make sure it fits your range.   At other times you'll be given a song. In that case you will probably get it beforehand, if you don't ask.  It doesn't have to be well-known, and if you mess up, don't let the directors know. Make something up, and when you remember the correct lines, begin to get back on track.  If you aren't the best dancer, pretend to be. Sometimes personality can make up for your terrible dance moves. Always try your best and don't get discouraged if people move really fast. Smile!  , Often, the director(s) will not show much reaction to your performance, but that doesn't mean they aren't paying attention. If they cut you off midway through a song or monologue, it means they have heard enough to judge you on, not that you're bad.    Apologize Stammer Flinch Prattle Stare into the director's eyes Squeal Try to make conversation Beg Brag Kiss up/compliment Go overboard Scurry in/scurry out Act overly excited or hyper Act sluggish or bored Exhibit any obnoxious behavior  , However, don't be too perky, that can come off as desperate and annoying.  Think of it as a showcase of your talent or a show you're putting on- that can help.  It's fun! In musicals, the ensemble makes up most of the cast. Extras require less rehearsal time, and they have more dancing, singing, costumes, scenes, and general camaraderie, not to mention they don't have to worry about forgetting a thousand lines.  Just because you didn't get a part doesn't always mean you don't deserve it, or that you are less talented than the person who did. Accept whatever happens with grace and never demand another audition. Always be kind and respectful to the directors, and the person who got the part you wanted, even if you are cursing at them inside. But try to avoid that too.  Most tryouts are for main parts only - i.e., they're going to ask you to do a scene between the two lovebirds or a monologue for the main character of your gender.    Does your character have an accent? If so, should you try to replicate it? Is the character messy or neat? Does he/she have a spring in his step or does he/she mope around? Is he/she mischievous? Does he/she say lines confidently or is he/she less confident? When asked beforehand, these kinds of questions can give you a head start.  This can be good, because it gives you the adrenaline boost you need. The most important thing is to channel that energy into your performance.   If you are too nervous, you will need to calm yourself down. Deep breathing helps some people, so does biting your tongue, or shaking yourself. Different things work for different people. It doesn't matter how nervous you are, you need to make sure the other people who are auditioning can't tell. Be an actor and hide it. Directors will 'take into account' that you are petrified, because if they assume that if you can't act in front of three people, you won't be able to do it in front of a hundred. Whether this is true or not doesn't matter in an audition setting -- hide it.  People act differently in restaurants in Hello Dolly than they do in the library in Music Man." Keep these things in mind and keep your mind off the butterflies. Instead of remembering all the details, just absorb the scenarios you've practiced. You will be fine!	Find out the name of the musical and either find a script, movie or CD to give you a full understanding of the types of characters involved. Choose two characters you think you could play well. Remember not to limit yourself to starring roles. Ask yourself why you chose these two characters or the main one and write your answer in a pad. Find out the specific date/time of your audition and the scheduled performance dates so you'll know if you have anything that will interfere with the shows. Ask how the audition process will go. Pick a song that's right for your voice type and show you are auditioning for. If a monologue is required, find something you can connect with. Dance. Remain confident and friendly. Never do the following things. Always portray yourself as poised, confident, calm, and happy. Try not to be disappointed if you are placed in the chorus or ensemble. Remember- sometimes, these things are unfair. Get in touch with the main characters. Think about the details for the character you're playing. You will always be nervous before an audition. Before auditions, find something that will help you focus on what you're going to do - something called "getting in character," which means you need to know who you are, where you are in time and where you are as a character.
The warp consists of strands of yarn or thread strung lengthwise, under tension, across the loom. The ideal warping thread has a slight spring to it. Choose wool yarn, strong cotton thread, or a non-traditional warping material, like grape vine., When warping a standard frame loom, start in the bottom left corner of your loom. Double-knot the end of your thread or yarn to the bottom cross-bar of your loom frame. Pull the piece of thread or yarn under and over the top cross-bar. Bring it down to the bottom cross-bar and loop it under and over.While the thread or yarn should be pulled tight, you must be able to lift the warp with one finger. When warping a cardboard loom, begin in the top left corner. Secure the warp thread to the back of your cardboard loom with a piece of masking tape—the tail should reach the middle of the board. Insert the thread into the first slit in the top left corner. Pull the warp thread to the bottom left corner and insert it into the first slit. Wrap the thread around the back of the cardboard loom and insert it into the next available top slit., Loop the thread or yarn around the top cross-bar followed by the bottom cross-bar in a figure-eight pattern.As you move from left to right, evenly space the loops across the cross-bars.Continue to wrap the warp thread around the cardboard loom. Insert the warp thread into the next available top slit, pull it down to the bottom, slide it into the next available bottom slit. Repeat., Create approximately 20 loops. When the thread or yarn reaches the top right corner of the loom frame, loop it around the top cross-bar and double-knot it. Cut the thread or yarn from the spool or ball if you have not done so already.After you have inserted the warp thread into each slit, pull the warp thread to the back of the cardboard. Cut the warp thread so that the tail hits the middle of the cardboard loom. Secure the tail to the board with masking tape. To maintain the warp’s tension, secure each piece of warp thread to the back of the cardboard with masking tape.	Select a warping thread. Begin the warp. Continue looping the thread or yarn. Complete the warp.
Getting a car loan is not impossible as a newcomer to the U.S., but there are some additional difficulties. Start out by shopping around, perhaps for a used car, that will be cheaper. If you can afford to pay cash, then you won’t need to worry about financing.; , If you need a car loan, understand that different banks or credit unions have different requirements regarding prior credit history. You will want to shop around and ask. It is possible to get a loan as a foreigner. Just be prepared that you may need to pay a bit higher interest rate.  There may be shipping restrictions across borders by the lender while debt is owed. In addition, if you're planning to take the car out of the United States, foreign countries may lack repair facilities for your vehicle or require engine modifications before you can legally drive.  Before you move to the United States, begin researching "expat car leasing and financing companies." You will find a variety of companies, like 24Expat,Expatride,International AutoSource,and many others. These companies offer financing and leasing rates to expats at competitive local prices. If possible, contact a company before you move to the US to take advantage of special offers and savings.  Many buyers may not realize that banks are not the only lenders. Most new car dealers will also handle their own financing. In some cases, if you finance your car purchase through the dealer, you may be able to get a better rate than you could get at a bank or other finance company. Research the conventional lenders first, and then keep these numbers in mind when you are shopping for cars., Work with the expat car service to get a better understanding of which of these options work best with your visa length and planned stay time in the country.  In order to drive in the United States, you will need a recognized form of driver's identification. If you have a foreign license written in English, you can use this license as a visitor or for a time after you become a resident (the specific time varies by state). However, if your license is in another language, you will have to get an International Driving License (IDL) from your home country before you visit the U.S. If you plan to immigrate, you will need to exchange your foreign license for a U.S. one within a certain amount of time. Residents of the following countries may do so easily through reciprocity agreements:   Canada. France. Germany. South Korea., In most of the U.S., you are required to have car insurance in order to drive. Before you are able to drive your new car away from the dealership, you will have to show proof that you are insured.New Hampshire is the only state that does not require car insurance,but even they highly recommend it., Although generally we say that every state requires you to have automotive liability insurance, the minimum requirements are different from state to state. In addition, lenders will usually require comprehensive and collision insurance for new cars. You will need to identify the requirements for the state where you intend to buy and register your car., Shop around, before you come to the U.S. or after you arrive, to find the best rates. Your expat car service should be able to help you secure auto insurance at an affordable rate., When buying a car, you will want to consider such things as the size (how many people are in your family?), the distance you will need to travel, and whether good gas mileage is important to you.  Take the time to research and become familiar with your vehicle options. Available manufacturers in the U.S. may differ from your home country. Consider asking your expat car service representative questions about the available vehicles.  In the U.S., prices for most items are set by the merchant and are not negotiable. Cars are different. Cars are listed with a “sticker price” (that is the price on the sticker posted in the car’s window). Most dealers, however, expect that you will make an offer that may be a few thousand dollars less than the sticker price. For a used car, there is usually even more room for negotiation. Some keys to good negotiation include:Research the car you want before you begin negotiating. After you have completed your shopping and you believe you have found the car you want, research it thoroughly. Using online sources like KellyBlueBook.com or Edmunds.com, you can look up the values of both new and used cars. These will give you a starting place for your negotiating. Have a target price in mind. Before you begin the process, you should know what you want to pay, and then a higher amount that you might be willing to pay. Use leverage to your advantage. When you are negotiating a price for a car, let the salesman believe that you are willing to walk away and go buy a different car from someone else. If they know they might lose your business, they may be willing to lower the price. Focus on the car’s price, not the monthly payments. Many car salesmen will try negotiating the price in terms of monthly payments, rather than the total. If you do this, you run the risk of adding thousands of dollars to the price without really noticing it. Keep the conversation focused on the total price., Almost all professional car dealerships, whether you are buying a new or a used car, will do the work of registering a car and getting the license plates for it., Each state has a Department of Motor Vehicles (or it may be referred as Department of Transportation, Registry of Motor Vehicles, or some other similar name). If you are handling the registration yourself, you will need to contact this office or review its web site and find out their specific requirements for car registration.   A handy site with contact information for all 50 states is DMV.org.  In most states, before you can register your car, you will need to get the following pieces of information:A registration application, which you can usually download from your state’s DMV web site. The title for the new car, showing your name as the owner. A lien might be on title if it has been financed. Proof of a satisfactory vehicle inspection. In most states, every car must pass a safety inspection in order to be registered. Some states also require an emissions or pollution test as well. You will need to take the car to a licensed mechanic or testing center to get inspected.  If you have not registered the car yet, you will not be able to drive it to the inspection location. If you are buying a used car, you will probably drive the car with the seller’s license plates to the inspection site, and then you will be able to get your own registration.   Proof of insurance. Payment for sales tax and other registration fees. Check with the DMV web site in your state to determine what this will be. It varies from state to state.  If, after you are through in the U.S., you choose to return home with your American-bought car, there are essentially three different choices for shipping. They vary based on time, cost, and security.Roll On, Roll Off (RORO): Vehicles are driven directly onto a ship and are lashed down. The travel time across the ocean (from the east coast to Europe, or from the west coast to Asia) is approximately two weeks. The cost is reasonable, but there is a risk of damage or theft. Containerized Shipping: About six cars at a time are loaded into a closed, locked container, which is then loaded onto a ship. This is a more expensive alternative but provides added security than the RORO method. Air freight: This is the most secure and fastest method of shipping your car. It is also the most expensive.  You will need to show the title that you received when you purchased the car, showing your name as the vehicle's owner, in order to go through Customs. If you purchased the car at an auction (primarily for dealers), you would need the auction gate release and a report from the DMV showing that the title is clear., Many shipping companies recommend that you remove any personal property from inside the car before shipping it. At least one source suggests that you protect your car seats and dashboard with plastic sheeting.You also need to deliver the car to the shipper with as little gas left in the tank as possible., Before shipping take these items off the car. Make sure that you have the title and registration, along with any other private information or personal identifying paperwork, with you before you leave the car with the shipping company. Take these materials with you then when you pick up your car at your destination.	Shop for a car you can afford. Research the lenders’ credit requirements. Consider where the car will eventually be based. Try an expat-specific financing company. Compare bank rates with dealer lending rates. Consider leasing as an alternative to buying. Make sure you can legally drive in the U.S. Understand the obligation. Find out the insurance requirements for your state. Secure affordable auto insurance. Consider your needs. Research your options. Negotiate the best price you can. Let the dealer handle it, if you are buying from a dealer. Contact the Department of Motor Vehicles for the state where you reside. Collect the information that you will need to register your car. Select the type of transport. Clear your car through US Customs as part of shipping it. Protect your car and personal property for the voyage. Remove your license plates and personal papers from the car.
It’s important to choose a plant that will thrive where you place it. You may not have a location that’s right for a shrub you want, but you can evaluate the available space to choose a plant that’s perfect for that spot. Before you buy your plant, take time to evaluate what type of shrub will thrive in the location you choose. Make notes of sun exposure, temperature fluctuations, soil moisture, root growth area, and soil composition and acidity. Ask someone at the nursery or garden center to help you choose the right plant.   Is the shrub being planted near your house, garage, or taller plants that will block out sunlight at certain times each day? Every plant needs a specific amount of sun and shade, so it’s important to note how much sunlight the shrub will receive. Set up a thermometer and mark down the temperature at different times to determine how much the temperature fluctuates. Measure the distance from the location you intend to plant to the closest objects on all sides. Roots spread laterally, so the amount of space around the planted location will determine how much room the plant has to grow. Keep in mind that other plants nearby may compete for water and nutrients in the soil.You can purchase kits to test pH at your local nursery. For optimal growing conditions, you should maintain a pH between 5.8 and 6.5.; , Shrubs are decorative plants, so you want to take advantage of their cosmetic appeal. Use your shrub to conceal unsightly objects on your lawn like air conditioning units. Create privacy by planting a row of tall hedges, or improve the curb appeal of your home with an attractive shrub near the door., New plants come in three varieties, balled and burlapped or B&B shrubs, bare roots shrubs, and containerized shrubs. You’ll need to measure the height of the roots from the ground to the “root flare,” part of the shrub at the base of the trunk where roots begin to spread out. This process is simplest for those shrubs that are bulbed and burlapped or containerized because the roots are tightly confined. Bare roots shrubs take a little more time and effort, but it’s important to measure properly to ensure adequate space for healthy root production.For bulbed and burlapped and containerized shrubs, place the handle of a shovel across the top of the rootball. The distance from the shovel handle to the ground is how deep the hole should be. The hole should be three to five times wider than the rootball at its widest point. For a containerized plant still in its pot, you can simply measure the height of the pot and subtract any space between the top of the pot and the dirt.For bare roots shrubs, find the darker line around the main trunk of the plant. This is where the plant was previously at ground level, and this line should be replaced at or slightly above ground level. Measure from this line to the bottom of the root system. Spread the roots over the ground gently. Try not to break or bend the roots unnaturally. It may be easiest to create a small mound of dirt, and spread the roots over the sides with the highest point of the mound below the trunk. Measure across the widest point of the root spread. The hole should be three to five times wider than the spread., Once you’ve measured the rootball you want to offer the newly planted roots soft soil that does not prevent or hinder growth. Dig out the soil, and place it on a tarp. Then, thoroughly break up the soil until it is has a granular appearance. Don’t till the earth deeper than is necessary. You’ll want the bottom to be solid to prevent shifting. Make sure the sides of your hole slope out from the middle and do not have a “glazed” appearance. Shoveling compacts the dirt, and the smooth looking soil may block out water or make it difficult for roots to grow., Once you have a hole of the right size, fill it with water. If the water completely drains away within 24 hours, you have good drainage and can place your shrub. If not, wait for the water to completely drain, and attempt the test again. If there is still standing water after 24 hours, consider planting in a different location.	Consider possible locations. Choose an attractive spot. Measure the roots. Dig the hole. Assess drainage.
This will make the lace appear as if it is running on and on without a break, which is ideal for items such as bags and stuffed toys. It won't always be possible but it's the first preference.; , The most common method for joining lace end to end is to overlap the ends and then over-sew the edges.   Turn the cut ends of the lace under if they're more than an inch (2.5cm) wide, before sewing.  Where the lace is wider (2.5" to 6" / 6-15cm), cut around the lace pattern with care on both ends of the lace and stitch together using stick-on adhesive to keep in place, as is done with wedding lace motifs. That way you can be sure it won't shift during sewing and the join will be perfect.	Seek to make an invisible join where possible. Overlap the lace. Treat very wide lace slightly differently.
You will need to remove the air filter housing to expose the carburetor, there may be a suitable screwdriver or ring spanner or socket and ratchet/ breaker bar needed to remove securing screws.; , You are attempting to drain the fuel tank. All fuel tanks have at least two fuel lines attached.   One pipe sucks fuel from the bottom of the tank, the other is the return pipe it returns unused fuel from the engine. All modern automobile engines have fuel pumps to suck fuel up to the engine. You need to determine whether your engine uses a mechanical or electrical fuel pump. Mechanical fuel pumps are bolted onto the engine block or cylinder head.  Electrical pumps can be located anywhere but are mostly submersed in the fuel at the bottom of the fuel tank. If you take the cover off the fuses usually located under the steering wheel and look at the sticker and see any reference to a fuse for the fuel pump then you have an electric fuel pump.    It is connected to the fuel filter that may be visible. Since all modern cars have anti-siphon devices fitted underneath the filler cap of the fuel tank you will use the cars fuel pump to drain the unsuitable fuel. Mechanical fuel pumps only function when the engine is turning over. It is not advisable to turn the engine over as the battery would be well flat before the tank would be drained out the fuel line. If the car has an electrical fuel pump you may be able to short circuit a wire from the horn or hazard warning or blower circuit into the electric fuel pump circuit after removing two fuses. The pump will then empty our the fuel line and into a seven up or cocoa cola bottle which you will fit over the end of the line. If this does not work then fill a bottle with petrol and make a hole with the thinnest needle you can find near the bottom. Have a comrade crank the engine while you let the stream of petrol that leaks out the hole over the carburetor. When the engine starts and runs on the fine stream stop cranking. The engine will proceed to run and power the fuel pump thus draining the tank. Obviously on engines with a mechanical pump the line would have to be disconnected on the side not hooked to the filter or the pump could not do its job. , Let the starter cool after each session for perhaps two to three minutes. When the engine starts and warms up there may be a slight miss until the last vestige of contaminated fuel in the newly mixed tank is expended.	Lift the hood/bonnet. Drain the fuel tank. Locate and remove the fuel line from the carburetor that is supplying the fuel. When the line is no longer pumping, fill the tank up with appropriate fuel and put everything back together the way you found it.  , Crank the engine until it starts for no more than twenty or 30 seconds at a time or you risk burning out the starter.
Unfortunately, there is no standard procedure when taking bikes on public transit. Some trains allow it, some only on certain hours, and other never at all. Coupled with any transitions you might make, such as switching to a bus or light-rail, and it may seem easier to skip the bike altogether. However, knowing your entire route in advance will make planning far easier. Google and Apple maps, for example, have extensive public transportation and bike maps that let you know all available routes, even mixed routes, after you type in your destination address.   If you need to take a bus, does the bus system accept bikes? How far are you traveling when you get off the train? It might make more sense to lock the bike at the station if you get right off at your destination.; , Find out if there are any fees, restrictions, or requirements. The most frequent restrictions include:   Only riding in bike-designated cars. No bikes during peak hours, frequently 8-10AM and 4-6PM No bikes on crowded or packed cars., Getting your bike up and down the stairs, through turnstiles, and on the train will inevitably take a little extra time, so plan accordingly. For short trips, and extra 5-10 minutes should be more than enough to get you there on time.Many stations do not let you bring a bike on an escalator for safety reasons, so be prepared to potentially haul up and down stairs.  Purchase the fare for your trip, including fees for bringing your bike. Many trains require an additional amount to cover the bike.   If you can't get in the turnstile with your bike, signal the attendant. You can usually swipe your card/pay the fare, then enter through the emergency or handicapped entrance after paying., Stand with your bike on the platform behind the boarding line until the train comes to a stop. Wait for other passengers to exit and enter before boarding.  Stow it away from doors and aisles, in a position where it won’t fall over and you can keep a hand on it. Try to turn the handlebars so that the wheels are in a straight line, out of the way of as many people as possible.   Use bike racks on the train if they are available, which usually involve wedging or lifting your front wheel into a small rack. If there are other bikes on the train, place your front wheel near their back. These allows the bikes to fit together better and keeps the handlebars from jamming into each other. Be sure your bike is secure if you're not holding it yourself. Don't leave it where other passengers can trip over it or run off with it. Make sure you can keep an eye on it.  The unwritten rules of a good train passenger will keep everyone happier as you move too and fro. When carrying a bike, let others on and off before you, respect the rules (no riding during rush hour or on crowded trains) and politely ask people move or adjust their bikes if you think you can fit them more snugly. And, if the ride is short and the train is crowded, just ride home. That's why you have the bike, after all.	Plan out your route ahead of time, including transitions, walking, biking, and time of day. Call ahead or check your train's website to see if they accept bikes. Allow extra time to get to your destination. Pay the correct fare. Stand on the platform. Board the train with your bike, standing along the side. Follow subway and train etiquette.
You'll need 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml) of white glue (also called school glue) and 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of liquid starch, the kind that's used to starch shirts. These ingredients will give you a small batch of sticky tack. If you want a larger batch, just remember to use the ratio of 2 parts glue and 1 part starch.  Put them in a container and use a spoon to mix them together. The mixture will immediately begin to stiffen, due to the interaction between the glue and starch. Soon it will form the consistency of sticky tack.  Use blue or another fun color to color your sticky tack if you'd like. Add just a few drops, since a little goes a long way. Stir it in so that the ball of sticky tack gets thoroughly colored.  Scoop the sticky tack into your hands and knead it so that it becomes firm, but pliable. If you think it feels a little sticky, work in a little more starch. If it's too dry to stick, add a bit more glue. Keep working the sticky tack until it reaches the consistency you want.  Pinch of a few small pieces to hang a poster or picture. You can store the sticky tack you don't use in an airtight jar or another container. If it gets a little dry before you use it again, you can add more glue and work it in with your hands to achieve the right texture again.	Measure out your glue and starch. Mix the glue and starch. Add a few drops of food coloring. Knead it with your hands. Use or store the sticky tack.
Open all of your car doors one-by-one, and take your mats out of the car, if they are removable. Do not clean them while they are still inside the car.You want to remove the mats so that you won't get water damage in your car’s interior. Also, you should not allow oily or foam consistency products to come in contact with the gas, clutch and brake pedals in your car as this could cause your foot to slip off the pedal during driving, which is dangerous. Clean the mats outside. You can clean the mats at a gas station or at home in your parking lot or inside your garage. Most car mats are removable. However, occasionally the mats are built into the car. In those cases, you will have to clean them inside the car.; , Use a vacuum to ensure that you suction up all of the dust particles and soil specks from your car mats before you try to clean them further.   Cleaning a damp carpet mat can be difficult. You could use baking soda to absorb some moisture and foul odor by lightly sprinkling it onto the carpet floor mat and then leaving it to sit for about 10-20 minutes, before vacuuming. Vacuum the mats on both sides, making sure to thoroughly get crumbs and dust off of them. , This will shake out some of the dust that is embedded in the rubber or cloth floor mats. Do this outside.   Give the mat a couple of whacks against the ground. Find a hard surface to strike the mats against. This works for rubber and cloth mats. You might also want to use a scraper to remove hardened materials from the rubber mat before cleaning it.	Remove your floor mats, whether rubber or cloth, from your car, if possible. Vacuum cloth floor mats first. Shake or whack the mats to remove dirt.
Oftentimes, theaters will list their phone number online as well as their current and upcoming movie showings. Choose which showing you would like to go to from their online schedule.   If you are going to larger theater chain, such as AMC, be sure to obtain the number of the theater that is located nearest to you. Once you've chosen your theater and showing, jot down their phone number.; , Let them know exactly which movie and what time you would like to go. Some theaters only allow you to buy your ticket a certain number of days ahead of time so be sure to inquire about any specific regulations.   If the theater requires you to wait to reserve a ticket then be patient and call back as soon as you are allowed to (for some theaters, this may be the day of the showing). You can even set a reminder on your phone if it’s for a movie you think will be particularly crowded and difficult to get a ticket for. Blockbuster releases that are in high demand may have available tickets and showtimes up to a month in advance,so don’t be afraid to ask if there’s an upcoming movie that you’re dying to see and want to reserve tickets for far in advance.  Some theaters will allow you to reserve your ticket ahead of time and you can pay when you arrive while others will require your credit card information over the phone to charge you at the time of calling. It’s best to have that information readily available so that you don’t lose your spot.   If you don’t have a debit or credit card, ask to borrow a friend or family member’s and then pay them back in cash.	Search online for nearby theaters. Call the cinema. Have your credit card handy.
For the best results, bypass the analog connection entirely and connect your guitar digitally to your computer. You can connect your guitar digitally to your computer through a pre-amp with a USB or Firewire outport. Before you purchase a pre-amp with one of these out ports, check to see if the guitar accessories you already own will work. These accessories may include amp-modelers, pedals, drum machines, and direct boxes., Place your standard guitar cable into your guitar. Plug the opposite end of the guitar cable into the pre-amp’s input port. Insert a USB, Firewire, or Optical cable into your pre-amp’s USB or Firewire out port. Plug the other end of this cable into your laptop’s USB or Firewire in port., When your guitar is properly connected, you will be able to assess the strength and quality of your guitar’s signal. Listen to the instrument through your computer’s speakers, a set of external speakers, or a pair of headphones. If you’re using external speakers or headphones, insert their respective cables into your laptop’s audio-out port. Play a few chords on your guitar to test the signal.This method will produce the crispest and clearest recordings.You may need to download and/or open recording software in order to hear your instrument. If your guitar’s sound is not coming through, make sure the instrument’s volume is turned all the way up. Open your computer’s sound settings and double check that your volume is not muted and that the correct port or device is selected (audio-in, audio-out, headphone, microphone, etc.). For specific instructions, consult your computer or device’s manual.	Purchase or find a pre-amp device with a USB or Firewire out port. Connect your guitar and pre-amp to your laptop. Test the signal.
A note can't be good if you can't sustain it. Before you work on your voice, you have to work on your breathing. Just like holding your breath comes easier with time, so does prolonged expulsion.   Start by breathing in for 4 counts and exhaling for 8. Increase the exhale by 4 until you hit 28. You're not stretching the capacity of your lungs; you are learning how to control the air.  Breathing out on a hiss will make it easier to control the air and give a tonal quality to the power behind it.  You wouldn't start a marathon without training, would you? Your vocal folds are muscles too! Show them the respect they deserve by warming up.   Start on middle C and practice going down in half steps until you hit the bottom of your range, working major scales. Then, take it back up to the top of your range. Use phrases like, "Mommy made me mash my M&Ms" to switch it up from the normal solfege (do, re, mi...). Practice lip trills and sirens. Start near the bottom of your range and slide your way up. This is especially useful for opening up the higher range.  As you do your siren, use your arms to give the higher range a physicality. Often it's easier to hit high notes if you can "see" them.  Too many pop singers are guilty of being overly nasal. If you modify your vowels, your voice will have a more classic, darker, developed tone that is more likely to sound trained.   Practice with multiple consonants. Start on ma, me, mi, mo, moo (that's pronounced like mah, meh, mih, moh, moo), and move to ta, te, ti, to(h), too. Then on with "z," "k," and "sh." At the "oo" sound, move up or down a half step and repeat until you hit the extremes of your range.  Each voice has a vowel that makes it easier to reach higher notes. Experiment to see which one makes it easiest for you.  Say you have a huge break between your chest voice and head voice; because of this, you avoid those three or four dangerous notes at all costs. As a result, the quality of those notes becomes very weak. In order to improve, you must take risks.   Go outside your comfort zone. If you're not comfortable with a certain range or length of note, practice it. It is the only way you will get better. Control will come with time. With enough practice, you'll be able to manipulate your voice into doing exactly what you want.  Sometimes our voices just aren't meant for certain notes. If you find yourself straining, either drop an octave or find a note in harmony.   Listen to what your voice is telling you. You may want horribly to be a soprano, but it just may not be in the cards. But remember: Your range does not determine how good your voice is. Sing with what you have--don't try to be something you're not.	Practice breathing exercises. Warm up adequately. Modify your vowels. Take chances. Sing in your range.
A partner or two in hallways with doors and T-intersections would be very appreciated as, at some point, you will be forced to turn your back on an area you have not yet cleared. You, however, as a private citizen, will likely have to clear it alone. Therefore, you must keep your eyes and ears open and balance multiple danger problems to keep your risk at a minimum. Don't be fooled though, this process, and the other processes in this article, all pose very high risk., Never make your way down the middle of a hallway. At the same time, keep from touching the walls. Hallways are similar to doorways, meaning that they are a narrow passage that an intruder may be expecting you to come through. The middle of the hallway is your fatal funnel.  Be aware, however, that stopping in a hallway to clear a room means that you have not cleared the rest of the hallway, and an unexplored (uncleared) area is now at your back.   Corners are no different, but what happens if there are two corners in two directions? This is a T-intersection. See the next section for more detailed information on how to clear a T-intersection.  The areas you have not cleared still contain danger points and you should be splitting some of your attention toward the uncleared areas.  Doing this means that you now have a room at your back that is uncleared, a hallway in front of you which is uncleared and the room you are intending you enter is also uncleared. This presents an overwhelming amount of danger zones. Placing yourself in this situation is unjustifiably dangerous.	Understand that hallways present some of the more difficult, dangerous, and dynamic areas of a building. Walk on one side of a hallway or the other. Handle obstacles such as doorways the same as mentioned above. Keep track of what areas you have cleared and which ones you have not. Methodically clear hallways — don't walk past one room to clear another.
Determine if their basic requirements make them incompatible (Such as high humidity frogs and low humidity cacti).; ,          An aquarium is basically a glass box that is only open at the top. Terrariums usually have hinged or sliding glass doors on one of the vertical sides to make access easier. You may also build your own enclosure. This can be done with glass and silicone, wood and epoxy, cement and epoxy, or a number of other ways. If humidity and temperature in your living environment are suitable, then you can water substrate for a plant at any level with a siphon (inverted-U) hose connecting to an aquarium. This arrangement can be raised, lowered or replaced according to root growth, substrate depth(s), and hydrophilic properties of substrate(s). If using plants that were previously potted plants, be sure to thoroughly flush out the roots with water to remove any toxic fertilizers before planting them in the vivarium.  Desert vivariums do not need a false bottom since there will be little watering.          A false bottom is an area for excess water to pool without drowning the plants roots. The two main types of false bottoms are filled vs. open false bottoms. A filled false bottom is a 1–2 inch (2.5–5.1 cm) layer of gravel or LECA with a screen on top to prevent dirt from entering. An open false bottom consists of a piece of egg crate supported by PVC, with a screen on top. Both styles are adequate methods with their own pros and cons.           These can be attached with silicone or hot glue; however, it is important that the dried adhesive is inert and cannot contaminate the vivarium with harmful chemicals. Possible background and hard-scape include: wood, cork-bark, rocks, disguised foam, disguised plastic, ornaments, or any number of other items. It is important that anything placed in the vivarium is clean and non-toxic. Items found outdoors must be cleaned before placing them in the vivarium.           A screen top usually prevents high moisture since the vivarium will take on the humidity of the room it is in; while a mostly glass top (90-95% glass, 10-5% screen) will keep the humidity level much higher. However, normal glass and screens blocks most UV light, thus UV lights must be placed inside the vivarium  ,          Plants require full spectrum lighting with a color temperature between 5000-7000K for best growth. Most 'normal' home lights are drastically less than 5000K while 'bluer' bulbs can be much higher Kelvin.           Equipment includes a thermometer, hydrometer, under-tank heater, in tank heater, pumps, filters, etc.           There are a large number of substrates available at pet-stores. Usually it is best to use these rather than collect anything from outdoors. Both plants and animals have substrate they prefer (do research!). A temperate or rain forest vivarium might have a layer of peat, fir bark, and black earth, followed by a layer of sphagnum moss, with a layer of leaves on top. A desert vivarium will probably have just a layer of sand with maybe some gravel in certain areas.           For temperate and tropical vivariums it is best to wet down the entire vivarium to make sure there are no overly wet areas. A desert terrarium will usually just have a water dish.           Remember, every plant has its own requirements; such as soil moisture, watering schedules, and light levels.           This will allow you to monitor the health of the plants and the functionality of your design without unduly disturbing the future animals. This is particularly important with water features.           This is important to prevent contaminating a vivarium that took a long time to build. A one to four week quarantine is suggested. ,	Decide what animals and plants you want to keep. Purchase a suitable sized aquarium or terrarium, remember animals like to move around and plants need room to grow. If this is a temperate or tropical vivarium build a false bottom. Install the background and hardscape. Install a top. Install a light. Install equipment. Add substrate. Add dechlorinated water. Plant the plants, leaving room for the plants to grow and 'fill in'. Turn on the vivarium and let it 'stabilize' for 24 hours to several weeks. Quarantine your newly purchased, and researched, animals to assess their health. Add your quarantined animals to the vivarium and monitor their acclimation closely for the first week or two.         , Sit back and enjoy your slice of the environment.
It is important to know your local and state laws before you begin to ride. A good course will not only cover state guidelines, but also review proper gear, tips for navigating hills and turns, and important life saving tips.  Always wear a properly fit helmet. The helmet should be snug and unable to move when the rider shakes their head. Chin harness must be secure, rider should feel pressure under their chin. The ATV safety institute recommends a long sleeve shirt, long pants, good gloves and boots that cover the ankle. Goggles are recommended; make sure they are free of scratches and fit securely around the head., Check the brakes and brake lights. Inspect the throttle. It must return to position immediately when it is released. Measure the air pressure in the tires; refer to the manufactures recommended level. Check headlights, always ride on a full tank of gas. Inspect the chains and drive shaft. Chain should have proper slack and lubrication. Nuts and bolts may loosen with ATV use, check to make sure they are snug., The places you will be riding generally won't be as well-kept as the roads, so be careful., Floods and rain cause poor traction, and in snow you may sink. Getting a strong headwind while riding fast could cause you to flip over., The momentum could throw you forward and lead to possible injury., When ascending, plant your feet firmly, keep a good grip on the handlebars and keep your weight toward the front of the ATV. When descending keep weight toward the rear of the ATV. Use your brakes gradually as you go down and look ahead at all times. Always maintain a safe speed; do not accelerate quickly. When traveling in a group, keep a safe distance between all riders especially on hills.,, Do not travel on public roads., Release the parking brake and slowly apply the throttle. Test the brakes one more time while going a slow speed., If your ATV begins to tip during a turn, lean your body further into your turn and gradually decrease speed., A quick sharp turn can lead to an accident.,	Take an ATV safety course.  Wear proper protective gear.  Inspect your ATV before every ride.  Be alert for anything your ATV can trip on.  Pay attention to weather conditions.  Avoid braking suddenly.  Use caution when going up and down hills.  No passengers should ride on a single ATV. ,  Let someone know where you plan to ride and an estimated time for your return.  Allow the engine to warm up before you begin.  When turning the ATV, decrease your speed and shift your body weight toward the inside of the turn.  Always make turns as wide as possible. Finished.
On most commercial patterns, the pattern is located in the top left corner. This number is used to identify the pattern design and size. Smaller pattern companies may replace the pattern number with a name., Sewing patterns are not one size fits all. Each pattern comes in multiple size ranges. Before purchasing a pattern, check the size range located to the right of the pattern number to make sure your size falls within the range., Pictures and or drawings of the garment will appear on the front of the pattern envelope. In addition to selling the garment, the images provide inspiration for fabric selection and information on how the garment is intended to fit. The images also depict design variations. The pattern contains the pieces necessary to create all of the variations., The design variations, also called “views,” also appear on the back of the envelope. These line drawings include more design details, such as darts, seam lines, and potential lengths. Each view is identified by a symbol, typically a letter. The symbol is used in charts and the pattern to identify information about that specific view., The back of the pattern envelope contains a list of fabrics suitable for this garment. Read through the list carefully. Select a fabric that is appropriate for the garment and that you are comfortable working with., In addition to fabric, your pattern may require notions and trims. The “Notions” section will list all of the additional pieces you will need to complete the garment. These may include items such as zippers, hook and eye closures, and elastic., Pattern sizing rarely aligns with ready to wear sizes. When cutting the pattern, you will follow lines for a specific size. Therefore, it is essential to accurately determine your size instead of assuming that you are a certain size.Use a measuring tape to measure various points on your body listed on the pattern envelope, such as your chest or bust, waist, and hips. Match your measurements to the measurements provided on the chart to determine your pattern size., The fabric requirements are listed directly below the body measurement and size charts. Locate the row containing the design variation you intend to create. Follow the row over until you reach the column containing your pattern size. The number in this cell is the amount of yardage you will need to complete the garment in your pattern size.   Most patterns will list alternative lengths for different widths of fabrics (45 inches wide v. 60 inches wide)., The last box in the chart contains information on the finished garment measurements. The finished garment will be slightly larger than your body measurements to allow for ease, or the fabric added to a garment so you may wear it comfortably. This information is often printed onto the pattern as well., The first page of the instruction booklet depicts images of the garment and its design variations. The line drawings show the front and the back of the garment. Under each drawing, you will once again find the garment’s corresponding symbol, typically a letter., Manufacturers often include line drawings of all the pattern pieces. Each image will be labeled, typically with a number. The number corresponds to a descriptive list located below the line drawings.   After reading the rest of the instructions, you may wish to mark which pattern pieces you will need., Prior to cutting and constructing your garment, devote time to reading the general sewing instructions thoroughly. This section contains information that may prevent you from making construction errors. It will provide you with details on items such as seam allowance and zipper insertion., Every design variation is accompanied with a corresponding cutting diagram. The layout depicts how all of the pattern pieces fit on the allotted amount of fabric.When viewing the diagram, make note of the following:   The grain line. The grain of the fabric runs parallel to the selvages of the fabric—the selvages are the finished edges of the fabric.. Each pattern piece will contain a line of arrows that corresponds to the grain line. Bent grainline symbols. If a grainline symbol is bent at the top, this means the piece should be placed on a fold. Double layer of fabric. A pattern may call for a specific piece to be cut out of a double layer of fabric., Unfold the pattern and lay it out on a flat surface. Retrieve your instruction book and turn to the cutting layout guide for your pattern. Use the cutting diagram to help you identify the pieces you will need for your garment.   The pattern pieces diagram may also be useful., Set your iron on low. Once the iron is preheated, iron the pattern. This will get rid of any wrinkle and folds in the paper. Carefully cut out each of the pieces at the correct size from the piece of pattern paper., Patterns contain various symbols. After cutting the pieces, familiarize yourself with the symbols printed on the pattern:   Single, heavy line: this is a cutting line. Double parallel lines: these lines are used to lengthen or shorten a garment. Triangles: triangular notches indicate where one piece will join with another piece. Dots: these empty or filled circles indicate where seams start and stop., Prior to cutting the pattern, you must properly prepare the fabric. Wash, dry, and iron the fabric. Fold your fabric as instructed in the pattern. Lay out your washed and ironed fabric on a flat surface—the wrong side of the fabric should face up unless specified otherwise.   Always double check to make sure your fabric is machine washable., Flip the instructions open to the cutting diagram for your garment. Place and pin the pieces onto the fabric as described and shown in the cutting diagram. Before cutting, make sure your pieces are properly aligned with the grainline of the fabric., Retrieve a pair of sewing scissors. Carefully cut out the pattern. Rotate the fabric as needed.

Look at selections in your local gardening center, or in major retailers such as Home Depot, Lowe's or Sears.; , Photosynthesis requires red and blue light to regulate vegetative growth.  Position the lights on a solid, even surface above the plants you want to grow.   Follow any specific set up instructions that come with the model you buy. There should be information in the packaging or on the box.  Vegetable plants do best outdoors in direct sunlight, so create a similar environment with your grow lights.   Keep your vegetable plants no more than 10 to 12 inches (25.4 to 30.5 cm) away from the grow lights.    Turn the lights off for 6 to 10 hours every day. Vegetable plants do need a period of darkness to mature and trigger production.    Consider full-spectrum fluorescent bulbs.These bulbs will provide warm and cool (red and blue) light which mimics natural solar light. These lights are great to get seedlings started and will provide intense, direct light for your vegetable plants. Use high intensity discharge lamps for energy efficiency and extra intensity. These grow lights are used by commercial growers and emit twice the amount of light for the same amount of energy. They are also more expensive.  The light is more intense in the center of the bulb, so it will help your plants grow evenly.    Wipe off any dust or dirt that accumulates. Dirty bulbs do not give off as much light as they should. Replace fluorescent bulbs that begin to darken on the ends. This means the bulb is aging and not producing as much light as it should.  Pick them off the plant when they are ready to be eaten.    Wait until you have some foliage or flowering on your plants if you began growing them from seeds with grow lights.	Shop around for grow lights. Look for lights that will provide all the colors found in natural sunlight. Set up your grow lights the same way you would set up a lamp. Make sure the intensity of the light is strong. Give your vegetable plants at least 14 to 18 hours of direct light every day. Choose the right bulbs for your vegetable plants. Rotate your vegetable plants under the grow lights every week. Inspect the bulbs in your grow lights every 4 to 6 weeks. Harvest your vegetables the way you would with an outdoor garden. Transplant your vegetable plants to your outdoor garden when the conditions are good.
Your heels should make a "V" shape. Make sure to focus on rotating your hips out. However, if you have hyperextended legs you can open your ankles to a couple of centimeters apart if your knees touch. If you demi-plie in 1st, you should make sure you are not rolling forward over your feet. This will lead to severe injuries.; , Your arms should make a circle, and they should rest about 3 inches (7.6 cm) away from your body.   Tuck your thumbs in and keep your fingers and arms long.	Put your heels together and spread your toes apart. With your arms, pretend that you are holding a beach ball with your arms all the way around it.

Think of the room in which you want to place the chair. Is it a bedroom, family room or simply a hallway? If you are planning to place the chair in a hallway it is likely to be more of a decorative piece and remain untouched. On the other hand, if you are placing the chair in the family room, you want a piece that can take a lot of wear.For example, if you have children, pets, or friends with a penchant for destruction, you'll want a chair that's durable and practical. However, if you live alone and want to make a statement, maybe you'd prefer a chair that's more artistic than practical.; , An accent chair should make a room more inviting, not clutter it up unnecessarily and block movement. Plan out where you want the chair to go before purchasing. For example, if you are looking for some extra seating in a family room, consider adding a chair or two to face inwards and book-end a sofa. Or try placing an accent chair in a corner or next to window to create a reading nook.Knowing where you will place the chair can also help you decide on size and style in the future.  There are many factors that can affect the size of your accent chair. Not only do you need to think about the size of the room, but also the height and width of your other furniture and the people who use it. For example, your accent chair should sit at the same height as your sofa and other chairs.   You may also want a chair with more leg room for those who are tall.  Before choosing a fabric, it’s best to consider how the chair will be used and by whom. This will help you pick a fabric that works in the room rather than against it. For example, if you have children or pets, you may want to avoid materials like suede. While a classic for accent chairs, it’s easily stained and not very durable. Similarly, you may want to go with microfiber rather than leather. It will give you a similar look, but be far more kind to dirt and food residue.   You can also use the fabric of a chair to make it stand out from the rest of your furniture. For example, if you have mainly upholstered pieces, try a leather accent chair for a rugged contrast.  Think about the look and shape of the chair you want in the room. For example, do you want something with a sleek silhouette or is it important to have a bigger piece with arms? If you're looking for a classic chair style, choose a roomy club chair with extra deep seats or a large wingback chair that can help balance out a room with a bigger sofa. You can even go a completely different route with a slipper chair, which is armless and sits low to the ground., One of the easiest ways to decide on a color for an accent chair is to base it off other colors already in the room. To do this, try using complementary colors on the color wheel. For example, if you have a lot of blue in the room via lamps, rugs, or paintings, then try a burnt orange-colored accent chair. Or, if you have a large chartreuse or earthy green sofa, try a deep violet for your chair., Accent chairs are meant to bring a new design element to a room. They are also easy ways to make an eye-popping statement while still remaining practical. Go for a color you love, but wouldn't use normally. For example, bold jewel-tones like jade, ruby, and sapphire always stand out with neutral tones like black, gray, or navy.You can also pick large patterns like floral prints, geometric shapes, chevron stripes, or animal prints to bring the chair to the forefront., For a put-together look, try matching the accent chair to other items in the room, either through their colors or patterns. This can be anything from pillows, lamps, and pictures to knick-knacks. For example, if you have black and white striped accent pillows on your sofa, try getting a chair that mimics the pattern with black and white lines. The chair will still stand out against your other furniture, however, it will help keep symmetry in the room by matching smaller pieces.   Or if you have a favorite art piece, pull one or two colors from there and find an accent chair in the same shades.	Take into account the chair’s purpose. Decide on placement. Look at the size. Pick a suitable fabric. Pick a chair style. Go for complementary colors. Choose a statement color or pattern. Work with the room’s decor.
It is recommended to do your sketch with a hard pastel or a pastel pencil. Draw lightly. It is also recommended to use a pastel paper to do your painting on. Wallis paper is like a very fine sandpaper and the tooth of the paper holds the pastels. It gives you rich colors and the ability to manipulate and blend them.    It is recommended that you use hard pastels first. Save the soft pastels for the finishing touches. Like icing on a cake. Because of the tooth of Wallis paper and other papers like it, using the hard pastels first will be beneficial and will keep you from using up your expensive soft pastels too quickly. The more pastel you put in an area...the darker it will be. It is also recommended that you wear rubber gloves and do your blending with your gloved finger. This to keep from getting sore fingers if you are using Wallis paper or a paper like it. It's like trying to sand off your fingerprints. Ouch!	Sketch what you want to paint. Begin painting with the pastels.
Farming often produces a good amount of biodegradable waste in the form of decayed crops and grass, and many farmers use these materials to create and sell compost. Buying from organic farmers is the only way to guarantee a completely organic product, however, since compost from other farms will likely contain trace amounts of pesticide residue from grass clippings and leaves. These pesticides will like break down during decomposition, creating a mostly organic product, but the compost will not be 100 percent organic unless it comes from an organic farm.  Many municipalities sell compost and other farming materials, especially if those municipalities include agricultural regions. Contact your municipality or nearby municipalities to find out if they sell organic compost and how you can obtain it.  Compost is a common soil amendment, and most garden centers will carry some even if the store is small. As time passes, the interest in organic farming and gardening continues to grow, organic composts are found more easily at a range of garden supply stores. You can further increase your likelihood of success by going to an organic garden center, though, since organic garden centers specialize in carrying organic products.  You can find high quality, certified organic composts at big box or chain retailers, but your likelihood of running across low quality composts is increased at a big box store. Many of these products are poorly labeled and tightly sealed, making it difficult to check the content and quality prior to purchase. If you do purchase organic compost from a major store, make sure that you check the quality once you bring it home. Do not use it if it appears poorly made., If buying from a manufacturer, buying in bulk rather than by bag is generally more cost effective. Moreover, since you cannot check the quality in person before buying the compost, you should only buy from reliable manufacturers and you should also check the quality of the compost once it is delivered.	Contact organic farmers. Go to the municipality. Check out the supply at a garden center. Use caution when buying from a big box store. Order online or by phone from compost manufacturers.You can purchase organic compost directly from the manufacturer by locating the manufacturer’s contact information.
Hardiness zones are based on regional temperature averages. These colorful bands have a difference of about 10 degrees Fahrenheit from one to the next.   Each zone is further divided into subzone a or b, with the former being 5 degrees (Fahrenheit) cooler than the latter. One’s official zone indicates the lowest or highest possible temperature in their area during a normal year.; , Gardeners should check plant tags and purchase specimens that are considered suitable for their particular zone.   For example, a perennial that is classified as being for zones 8 to 10 would probably not survive the winter in zone 6. Likewise, gardeners in zone 11 would have a hard time getting the aforementioned plant through the summer.  The hardiness zone map is not a completely infallible resource but it is good as a general guide. Some of the faults with the map are outlined below:   Though efforts have been made to incorporate known microclimates into the updated map, the revised edition may not account for all of the nuances that are out there. The plant hardiness zones don't take into account extreme weather patterns, so gardeners who are experiencing unseasonably cold or warm periods may experience some plant loss as a result. Growers should keep in mind that some specimens that are said to grow in their zone may not necessarily thrive there. After all, there are many factors besides temperature which may account for a perennial’s overall success or failure.  The USDA has published a USDA Hardiness Zone Map which makes it easier to determine your exact zone. Go to the website and click on your state. A detailed map of the state that includes major cities will pop up to show you exactly which zone you live in.   To make this map, the USDA gathered average low winter temperature data for all areas throughout the United States and then grouped areas with similar temperatures together to form zones. Each individual zone is 10 degrees F warmer or cooler than the zones adjacent to it. For instance, USDA Hardiness Zone 5 is assigned to areas where the average winter low is between -20 and -10 degrees F. USDA Hardiness Zone 6 is assigned to areas where the average winter low is between -10 and 0 degrees F (an average of 10 degrees warmer than zone 5). And USDA Hardiness Zone 4 is assigned to areas where the average winter low is between -30 and -20 degrees F (an average of 10 degrees colder than zone 5). The zones are further subdivided into 5-degree Fahrenheit increments. USDA Hardiness Zone 5A winter lows are between -20 and -15 degrees Fahrenheit while zone 5B is -15 to -10 degrees Fahrenheit.  The range of average annual minimum winter temperatures for each zone on the USDA Plant Hardiness Zone map is as follows:Zone 0:   a: < −53.9 °C (−65 °F)  b: −53.9 °C (−65 °F) to −51.1 °C (−60 °F)    Zone 1:   a: −51.1 °C (−60 °F) to −48.3 °C (−55 °F)  b: −48.3 °C (−55 °F) to −45.6 °C (−50 °F)    Zone 2:   a: −45.6 °C (−50 °F) to −42.8 °C (−45 °F)  b: −42.8 °C (−45 °F) to −40 °C (−40 °F)    Zone 3:   a: −40 °C (−40 °F) to −37.2 °C (−35 °F)  b: −37.2 °C (−35 °F) to −34.4 °C (−30 °F)    Zone 4:   a: −34.4 °C (−30 °F) to −31.7 °C (−25 °F)  b: −31.7 °C (−25 °F) to −28.9 °C (−20 °F)    Zone 5:   a: −28.9 °C (−20 °F) to −26.1 °C (−15 °F)  b: −26.1 °C (−15 °F) to −23.3 °C (−10 °F)    Zone 6:   a: −23.3 °C (−10 °F) to −20.6 °C (−5 °F)  b: −20.6 °C (−5 °F) to −17.8 °C (0 °F)    Zone 7:   a: −17.8 °C (0 °F) to −15 °C (5 °F)  b: −15 °C (5 °F) to −12.2 °C (10 °F)    Zone 8:   a: −12.2 °C (10 °F) to −9.4 °C (15 °F)  b: −9.4 °C (15 °F) to −6.7 °C (20 °F)    Zone 9:   a: −6.7 °C (20 °F) to −3.9 °C (25 °F)  b: −3.9 °C (25 °F) to −1.1 °C (30 °F)    Zone 10:   a: −1.1 °C (30 °F) to +1.7 °C (35 °F)  b: +1.7 °C (35 °F) to +4.4 °C (40 °F)    Zone 11:   a: +4.4 °C (40 °F) to +7.2 °C (45 °F)  b: +7.2 °C (45 °F) to +10 °C (50 °F)    Zone 12:   a: +10 °C (50 °F) to +12.8 °C (55 °F)  b: > +12.8 °C (55 °F)    , While the average low temperature in the winter is a big factor in determining which plants will grow in your zone, the average high summer temperatures must also be considered.   Many plants cannot take the heat in hot southern climates. This high end of a plant’s temperature tolerance is actually taken into consideration when a plant is assigned a zone range. For instance, Japanese spirea (Spiraea japonica) is hardy in USDA Hardiness Zones 4 to 8. This means it will only thrive in climates where winter temperatures drop to below 20 degrees Fahrenheit. It will not grow well in the mild winters and hot summers of USDA Hardiness Zone 9 or higher.  Living in warmer climates in the west, south and along the coast can make finding your gardening zone a little more complicated. These areas are riddled with microclimates that are influenced by elevation. Temperatures within these microclimates are not the norm for the general area.   Fortunately, “Sunset Magazine” has gathered information about these microclimates to help gardeners purchase the right plants. Go to their “Plant Finder” page, click on “What is your Sunset Climate Zone?” and simply enter your zip code. Sunset climate zone tolerances are not often listed for plants purchased through the mail, though. So when you live in these warmer areas, it is better to go to a local nursery or garden center to purchase plants. They will be very familiar with these microclimates and can recommend the right plants for your gardening zone.  The best time to plant trees, shrubs and perennials depends to some extent on your USDA Hardiness Zone.   In Zones 9 through 1, where temperatures dip to below freezing during the winter, deciduous trees and shrubs should be planted right around the first killing frost in the fall. Evergreens and perennial plants should be planted right after the last hard frost in the spring. If evergreens are planted in the fall, they often sustain damage to the leaves due to drying winter winds and cold temperatures. The Farmer’s Almanac is a very helpful resource when trying to determine when the first and last frosts usually occur in your area. In USDA Hardiness Zones 10 and above where temperatures rarely drop below freezing, the best time to plant trees and shrubs is in late fall, winter or very early spring to give the plants time to get established before the heat of the summer. Perennials should be planted after the last frost in the spring.  Take the ever-fluctuating climate into consideration when selecting trees, shrubs and perennials. All areas throughout the United States experience unusual highs and lows from time to time.   Determine your Hardiness Zone then choose plants that are rated hardy for at least one Zone higher and one Zone lower to insure the plant will survive an unexpected extreme.	Understand what is meant by a plant hardiness zone. Check plant tags to find the recommended zone for planting. Recognize the issues with the plant hardiness scale. Use the USDA zone map to find your exact plant hardiness zone. Familiarize yourself with the temperature scale. Take a plant's heat tolerance into account. Consider whether you live within a microclimate. Know that planting times will vary according to your hardiness zone. Play it safe.
Places you can buy them are eBay or Home Depot. You could also simply pick the seeds out of a pumpkin.; , Fill it with compost or natural fertilizer. Using your fingers, dig a small hole into the compost/natural fertilizer.  Make sure they're not in too deep before covering the hole with the fertilizer once more.  However, make sure the soil doesn't get too wet. Otherwise, the seeds will die.  Then, transplant them into clay pots. However, be careful not to disturb the pumpkin roots - they might go into shock and die.  The tendrils of the pumpkin plants will then coil around the dowel rods. After a while, the pumpkins will produce blossoms, which is a sign that they will be ready soon.  Since your pumpkin plants are indoors and have no access to pollination by bees or other insects, you are in charge of pollinating blossoms so that your plants can produce pumpkins.   Learn how to identify female and male blossoms. Pumpkins produce both male and female blossoms on the same vine. Male blossoms are longer, thinner, and look like trumpets. They have a stamen (little stem with pollen on it) on the inside. Female blossoms are wider, shorter, and more open, like little bowls. They do not have stamens in them. Watch (and possibly collect) your male blossoms carefully. It is possible for the vine to produce male blossoms first. They might wilt before a female blossom develops. If they wilt, don't throw them away, but save them until a female blossom is open. Pollinate the female blossoms. This can be done in two different ways: if your male blossoms are still on the vine and alive, use a clean paintbrush (or baking brush/basting brush) to carefully pick up some pollen (yellow powder) off of the stamen (little stem in the inside middle of the blossom) of the male blossoms. Use your brush to gently touch the pollen to the base (inside) of the female blossom(s). If your male blossoms are wilted, open them up carefully and pull out the stamen (stem in the middle of the blossoms with the pollen on the end). Take the stamen and gently push it with the pollen end into the female blossom until it touches the bottom and some pollen comes off. You can just leave the stamen in there, if you want, or remove it afterward. , Cut off the pumpkin about two inches above the pumpkin's top.	Purchase pumpkin seeds. Find a plastic, disposable cup. Place three seeds about half an inch down. Water the pumpkin seeds every other day. Wait a few weeks until all the pumpkin seeds have sprouted. Next to the pumpkins in the clay plots, put in six foot dowel rods. Pollinate the blossoms. When fruit develops from the blossoms, make sure your plant gets enough light and water.  , Once the pumpkins have turned the mature color, they are ready to harvest.
Boston ferns will do best in a potting mixture of peat moss, sand, and garden soil. You can buy all of these at your local gardening store. Your final mixture should be even parts of each ingredient.The pot should be big enough for your fern to sit comfortably without it's roots being near the drainage holes, but without a lot of extra space that could accumulate "root rot.", Put your mixture and plant into the clean pot with drainage holes in the bottom.The fern can be planted about half of the way to the top of the pot so that the roots have space in the soil. Fill in the rest of the pot with more potting mixture, leaving about 1 inch( 25.4 mm) of space from the top., In many places, the summers are warm and humid enough to provide the perfect environment for a Boston fern. They do best in environments with humidity levels of at least 50 percent. If your daytime temperatures are between 65 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit (18 to 24 degrees Celsius), and your nighttime temperatures are between 55 and 65 degrees Fahrenheit (13 to 18 degrees Celsius), your Boston ferns will thrive outdoors.You can place them on your porch or patio, and they should do well.   The cooler temperatures at night will help to prevent fungus from developing.  If you are keeping your Boston fern indoors, whether permanently or just for the winter months, you will need to be careful about making sure it has adequate humidity. The very best thing to do is to place it in a room with a humidifier. Keep your house between 65 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit (18 to 24 degrees Celsius), and put it in a cooler room at night.If you don’t want to invest in a humidifier, there are other options. You can place your fern in a saucer filled with small stones and water. The water will create humidity as it evaporates.  Boston ferns do best when receiving indirect, filtered sunlight. If they’re outdoors, place them somewhere where they will get sunlight through tree branches, or cracks in a porch roof. If they’re indoors, place them near a window. You don’t want your fern to be in shade, but you don’t want them to be in direct sunlight. It’s a delicate balance., Just like sunlight, you want to provide your Boston fern with enough water, but not too much. Water it with lukewarm water so that the soil is completely damp but not soaked. During warm weather months, you’ll need to water it more frequently. Make sure that the soil is never completely dry.In the wintertime, the fern is not in “growing season.” You can be less vigilant about watering it, and it's actually good to let the soil become dry to the touch before watering again. As new growth appears, start watering the fern more often so that the soil is continuously damp.  Boston ferns don’t require much, but it is helpful to feed them monthly during the warmer months. Purchase houseplant food at your local gardening supply store. Read the instructions on the packaging, and dilute it so that it is half as strong for your fern.   During the winter months, you can skip these feedings.  Fronds are the branch-like pieces that extend from the plant, covered in leaves. Older leaves may become discolored or lose their leaves, which isn’t the most aesthetically pleasing. Use sharp, clean scissors to remove the fronds all the way at the base. This will allow new, healthy fronds to grow.The best time to prune your Boston fern is in the spring or summer, during growing season.  Luckily, Boston ferns aren’t typically a target for insects, but they can occasionally attract bugs. Don’t use anything too harsh on your fern. Spray it with a mild insecticide or a natural insect repellant, and observe. Hopefully, this will be all you need to control any potential pests.	Gather your potting supplies. Pot your fern. Place your fern outdoors in a warm, humid environment. Put your Boston fern in an appropriate room indoors. Provide your fern with indirect sunlight. Keep the soil moist. Give your fern monthly feedings. Trim discolored or leafless fronds. Protect your fern from insects.
Pull the end of the thread through the needle so that the tail is a couple of inches long. Turn the hand wheel toward you until the needle is no longer visible and goes into the bobbin case.  Move the hand wheel slowly until the needle reaches its high point again. Continue to hold the thread that came through the needle during this process. When the needle comes up, the bobbin thread loop will also rise.  Pull the thread toward you until the loop is brought further out of the bobbin case. Pull both of the pieces of thread until they are under the presser foot. Drape the tail of the thread to the back and the right of the sewing machine.	Lower the needle. Raise the needle. Arrange the thread.
For a sustained, powerful aroma, make a custom candle. Choose a mason jar or other fire safe container. Go to a craft supplies store for some smokeless candle wicks and flaked soy wax, and make sure your kitchen is stocked with a tablespoon of vanilla extract, another of cinnamon, and ½ a tablespoon of ground clove.Use a microwave and start melting your wax by heating one cup on high for two minutes. Once the first cup is melted, add a bit of wax in one minute increments until you have sufficient melted wax for the container that will hold your candle. If you’re using a standard mason jar, you’ll need two cups of wax overall. Once the wax is melted, add the vanilla and spices. Mix well, ideally by stirring with a disposable skewer. Wrap the end of a candle wick that will be exposed around a thin item that can bridge the opening of your candle’s container. Allow the metal-tipped end to dangle to the bottom of the container. Pour the melted wax into the candle container while adjusting the wick to keep it in the center of the wax. Allow the candle to sit at room temperature for at least 4 hours to set.  You can make a spray that can instantly fill a room with the fall scent of your choosing. For an especially woodsy option, start with 3 tablespoons of either vodka, ethyl alcohol, or witch hazel. Add 10 drops each of the following oils; juniper, sage, bergamot, and cinnamon. Add these ingredients to an 8-ounce spray bottle and fill the bottle the rest of the way with water.   Always shake the bottle well before using. For a similar option, but sweeter-smelling option, go with 10 drops each of cedar wood, rosemary, orange, and clove oils instead. Avoid spraying your aromatic mist on anyone’s skin, or in front of anyone’s face.  If you have an essential oil diffuser, there are several great blends you can make to produce fall aromas. For example, use 3 drops of cardamom and 1 drop each of clove, cassia, and ginger essential oils to make a spiced Chai-inspired scent. For a more cool-walk-in-the-woods approach, use 3 drops of eucalyptus, 2 drops of juniper berry, and a single drop of sage essential oil.To get the scent of apple pie emanating from your diffuser, add 2 drops each of clove, ginger, and cinnamon bark oils. Add a drop of nutmeg too, for an even sweeter aroma. While classic cone or stick incense can provide fall-inspired aromas as well, essential oils are safer, healthier, and will better disperse aroma in your home.	Make your own fall-scented candles. Make an essential oil spray. Mix a fall-scented blend for your diffuser.
Fill the bowl with warm water until it is nearly full and rest the tuber on the surface of the water. The tuber should float. Place the bowl near a warm window and change the water every three to seven days.   Do not expose the tuber to direct sunlight or freezing temperatures. Plant the lotus within a few weeks after the tuber sprouts.  The right size container will depend on the type of lotus you chose. Bowl lotuses are very small and can fit comfortably inside a 2-gallon (7.57-liter) container, but a large lotus may need a 50-gallon (189.27-liter) container.   Make sure that your container does not have holes. Your lotus may begin growing out of the holes, creating a mess and causing it to perform poorly.  The best dirt is about 60 percent clay and 40 percent river sand, but most dense soils will work sufficiently well. Leave about 1 to 4 in. (2.54 to 10.16 cm) of empty space in between the top of the soil and the rim of the pot.  For now, the surface level of the water should only be about as high as the pot, if not a little higher.  Place it in a horizontal position with the back part next to the wall of the container and the growing point toward the center. The growing points should stick straight up.   Gently press the tuber into the soil just enough to anchor it, but do not bury it too deep. The surface of the water should only be slightly higher than the top of the growing tip.  Your plant will be ready for deeper water once the growing tips show leaves. Smaller types of lotus only need 1 to 6 in. (2.54 to 15.24 cm) of water covering the top of the soil, but larger varieties may need up to 3 feet (0.9 m). (1 m) of water.  If you do not weigh the tuber down, it will float to the surface of the water.	Float the tuber in a large bowl. Select the right container. Fill your container with dirt. Place the pot in a shallow pond or tank. Set the tuber on top of the soil. After a few days, place the pot into your pond. Place a rock on top of the tuber to weigh it down.
Hold the coin by its edges: touching the surface directly can leave small scratches in the surface. If you want to protect the coin’s surface, don't rub it.  The higher your water pressure, the better. Make sure to not use a high-powered water jet that could go straight through the coin.  If dirt remains, lightly scrub the coin with a soft toothbrush and dish soap. Run the toothbrush under warm water to further soften the bristles. Rinse the brush and the coin frequently to avoid scratching the coin with the loosened dirt. Do not apply much pressure, and focus on brushing only the soiled area of the coin.   Toothbrush bristles come with varying degrees of firmness — you want one labeled as soft or extra-soft. If you use a firm bristle, you risk damaging the coin.  Especially on ancient coins, there may be dirt that remains after soaking and brushing. To remove this, use a small, sharp implement such as a toothpick or a precision screwdriver. Carefully pry and chip off the encrusted dirt, and try not to scratch the surface of the coin. You can spot-clean more precisely if you work under good lighting and use a microscope or magnifying glass.  Wait about ten minutes, then rub the vinegar off with a toothbrush. This may give the coin a more polished finish. Consider using anything acidic: lemon juice, apple cider vinegar, and even sodas have been said to help clean rust off of old coins.   Consider adding salt to your vinegar/citric acid/soda. The combination of acid and chloride may make your cleaning solution even more powerful.  After soaking, thoroughly rinse the coin under very warm, running water. If the coin is clean enough for your taste, proceed to drying. Don't leave the acid on the coin, or it will keep etching and produce an unsightly green coating of copper salts.  Pat the coin dry with a soft, lint-free cloth, and then lay the coin on a soft, dry cloth to finish drying. Do not rub the coin dry.	Wash the coin under cold running water. Run the water over the coin for about a minute. Lightly brush the coin. Spot-clean encrusted dirt. Pour some vinegar over the coin. Rinse the coin again. Dry the coin.
The filter will attach to the pipes beneath the sink, so clear enough space to accommodate the filter system.; , Before you choose a filter, you will need to know what kind of impurities are present in your natural water supply.   Buy a do-it-yourself water testing kit to determine what you want to filter out of your water. Ask the water company for details on your water composition. If you use city or public water, they are required to disclose the makeup of the water you are drinking.  Each under-the-sink system will specialize in certain contaminants.   Review different models and talk to sales associates about what will work best for your water.  Under-the-sink filters should be able to make your water appealing to drink as well as safe.  Under-the-sink water filters use one of these methods to remove pollutants in your water.   Choose an activated carbon system if you want to use a replaceable cartridge. This type of system will capture chemicals, pesticides and other chemicals by using carbon in the filter.  This system will remove larger particles from your water and flush them as waste. The water pressure will be higher, and excess water is stored in a tank under the sink.  Many under-the-sink models include an attachment for the faucet which will allow you to get purified water for drinking, which uses the filter, and then regular tap water when you are cleaning or washing dishes.  You can pay between $100 and $300 for an under-the-sink water filter.  Major chains such as Lowe's and Home Improvement carry them, and you can also check with your local hardware store.  Specific brands sell them on their websites, and you can also find them on sites such as eBay, Amazon, Overstock and other online retailers.  Installation of your under-the-sink water filter can be timely. Some companies will install the filter for you.   Use a professional if you are planning to utilize a warranty. Many warranties will require you to have your filter professionally installed.  Most under-the-sink filters are easily maintained. You will want to find out how often to change the filter and what to do if it breaks or malfunctions.	Make sure you have room under your sink for a filter. Understand your water composition. Shop for a filter that will remove the pollutants present in your water. Choose a filter that can remove odors as well. Decide between activated carbon or reverse osmosis. Choose reverse osmosis if you want something more complex. Consider a filter that comes with a faucet attachment. Consider your budget. Look for filters in home improvement stores. Shop online for a larger selection and potential price deals. Consider professional installation. Ask a sales associate about maintenance.
To be successful on this project (where failure could, one might assume, leave you dead) requires a thorough survey of the site you choose. Here are some explanations why this is critical to success.  Bomb shelters must be able to sustain minimal damage in a near miss or direct hit from exploding ordinance.  Soft soil can offer only limited resistance to bomb energy, so building in soft soil requires a deep excavation with highly reinforced construction. In areas with poor drainage or a high water table, the option of building deep will require more engineering than this page will offer. Building in solid rock, unless you have a suitable cavern to use as a superstructure, will require blasting and drilling, which also will exceed the scope of this page. Building into the side of a mountain or steep hill is a good choice for people with the resources to do so, and without the depth requirements, the following steps are fairly typical of what needs to be done to successfully complete your bomb shelter project. Building on stable, flat, well-drained land is the most direct approach to getting the job done, and that will be what we assume the reader plans to do.; , Basically, there are four things to keep in mind while designing your shelter.  How many people will it house? This will give you information needed to design the shelter in respect to size and accommodation. Since bomb shelters typical are very temporary in nature unless a sustained bombardment is anticipated, you can expect to allow at least 72 square feet of space per person. Decide what ordinance your structure will need to resist. A typical 500 pound bomb has a blast energy of about 10,000 feet per second using high explosives, and if fused for a ground burst or impact detonation, you will want a minimum of 15 feet of energy absorbing material between the ground and your structural roof.  Bunker busters, on the other hand, can penetrate many feet (the exact distance, for obvious reasons, is classified), of reinforced concrete.  Since 20 feet is a reasonable limit to excavate and redress, we will assume our design on that depth, other considerations are best left to experts.   With an excavation this deep, shoring, sheet pilings, and other issues will require professional assistance, so the following construction steps are general requirements for minimal performance., If you are knowledgeable about concrete construction methods including load bearing cast in place concrete beams, roofs, and walls, you could do this yourself, however getting an expert is recommended, Most likely, you will need engineered plans and a geotechnical report before a permit will be issued.  Now that the technical issues have been addressed, look further down for actual building instructions.,,  For a 12X18 foot shelter, you will want to clear about one acre of land for ancillary use., Trying to dig a very deep hole on unlevel land is an invitation to disaster., This is to allow an access ramp to be created, and will give workment/equipment access in later steps. Continue to build your ramp until you are below the finish floor grade of your shelter., You may use a load for this purpose, but a large excavator, in the 300 to 350 range and with an extended reach boom will give faster and more efficient production., Working in the bottom of a deep pit without cave in protection is illegal and foolish. When unstable soil is encountered, either use shoring systems or sheet piling to protect the workers., You may now want to rough in whatever utilities your shelter will require, such as electrical power, plumbing, and a fresh air supply duct, since these may be installed underneath your shelter foundation.,  Since the main structural element of the shelter will be the walls and especially the roof, you will not need an very thick floor, but the exterior walls will require a substantial foundation. This can be placed in a monolithic slab, making the floor itself about 8 inches thick, and the wall foundations about 3 feet thick and 5 feet wide., Number 5 rebar on 8 inch centers, the wall footings will need something like 8 number 8 rebar, 4 top and bottom supported by number 4 rebar stirrups on 24 inch centers. You will also want to provide 2 rows of dowels made from number 8 rebar on 12 inch centers spaced 10 inches apart. These will require a minimum of 30 inches embedment and 6 feet of projection. Keep in mind these are general design requirements, if your structural engineer requires more or different configurations, he is the expert., Your bomb shelter should be protected by a blast resistant, reinforced concrete and steel laminated structural door and frame. Consulting a vault door manufacturer like Mosler is probably a good idea., You will almost certainly require an aerial concrete pump for this part of the project, choose one with sufficient boom and capacity to reach all sides of the slab without getting too near the excavation. These special vehicles can have booms from 30 to 40 meters long, and a pump hose 6 inches in diameter., You may use coil rods, snap ties, or other means to secure the forms, along with whalers, stiff backs, and other shoring to keep your walls plumb and uniform in thickness. You will want to go ahead and erect the inside forms to the finished ceiling height of the bomb shelter. Generally, a minimum of 7 foot is required, but 8 foot ceilings are considered standard., The sides will be reinforced with number 8 rebar on twelve inch centers vertically (two rows), and number 6 rebar horizontal at 12 inch maximum centers on each row of vertical bars. Make sure to use corner bar reinforcement at all corners, and lap bars at splices a minimum of 48 bar diameters.,, The tensile strength of the concrete is up to you or a structural engineer, but 4000 psi concrete is recommended. The exterior forms should extend higher than the interior ceiling so they will act as a perimeter form for placing the concrete roof on your bunker.  Depending on the blast energy calculation you made earlier, decide on the thickness of the bunker roof.  Since it will support the weight of tons of earth as well as resisting the bomb blast, a minimum thickness of 2 feet is suggested., A minimum to two mats of number 8 rebar at 10 inches on center is needed, for roof spans greater than 16 feet, increase the rebar size, decrease the spacing, and thicken the roof unless steel support beams and columns are used to offset the increase load. You may also consider pouring lateral concrete support beams (and even using high tensile pre-stressed concrete slabs for the roof, if it is in your budget)., Make sure the concrete is slumped correctly and that you vibrate it to consolidate the materials while pouring. Using the services of a testing laboratory will help ensure the concrete reaches its required strength., You will want to leave the outside forms in place until the roof has been cast in place., You may choose to rent metal shoring systems from a form company, but you will need to install a minimum of one 4X4 tee jack at 32 inch cents both ways with the top of the tee 1 inch below the form joist bottoms. Assuming you are using 2X6 pine joists for your form, and the ceiling is 8 feet high, your tee jacks will be 7 feet 5 inches tall.  Install diagonal bracing to keep your tee jacks plumb and in line. For the uninitiated, a tee jack is a vertical post built from a 4X4 with a horizontal Tee on top, also usually a 4X4., After your tee jacks are in place, lay out your joists on 12 to 16 inch centers, then deck the joists with either form panel metal sheeting (preferred) or a minimum 3/4 form ply sheeting., You will have two or three mats of rebar, minimum, so tie your first mat of number 8 rebar on ten inch centers supporting it on rebar chairs sold for this purpose, the support and tie of the second mat using standees to maintain the correct spacing between mats., As with the walls, higher strength concrete is required, with a minimum yield of 4000 psi, but a preferred design mix of 5000 psi or 850 flexural strength. Allow this concrete placement to cure for a minimum of 7 days before removing the shoring support system. After 28 days, the outside forms can be removed, and backfilling can commence., If you have installed an air supply duct underneath the slab, you can backfill to the top, otherwise, you will want to install this duct work when you reach the elevation required., Do not backfill the access ramp yet, as you will need to construct a tunnel entrance to allow access first., You will need to create a tunnel at least 50 feet long to reach the door of your bomb shelter. Depending on the size of your door, using a concrete pipe or structural tubing like asphalt coated galvanized steel pipe in 10 or 12 feet diameter is the most practical method. Since tunnel failure can turn your refuge into a tomb in short order, care in choosing and constructing your entrance venue is just as important as designing and building the shelter itself., Restore the vegetation over the top, connect the utilities and air supply ducts, and you are finished.	Develop a site plan for the location you plan on building your bomb shelter at. Determine the critical factors to consider in your design. Hire a geotechnical firm to address drainage, soil density, excavation shoring requirements, and other factors to ensure safe digging and building conditions. Hire a structural engineer for detailed construction plans. Talk with your local planning and zoning office to determine what permits and licenses your project will require.Mark out your site, erect silt fences, erosion barriers, and other controls needed to begin clearing and excavation. Clear sufficient land for your excavation, spoil piles, and haul/storage areas. Grade the excavation area to a reasonably flat profile. Start digging your excavation about 150 feet from your actual shelter's footprint. Dig the bottom of the shelter pit about 4 feet wider than the outside wall dimensions. Inspect the sides of the excavation often, especially if you enter a different soil layer, to make sure they are stable. Dig until you reach the excavation requirements, grade the bottom of your pit, and compact the soil. Form up the foundation for your bomb shelter. Install the footing and slab reinforcement. Allow an opening on the end of the slab where your ramp enters your pit for a door. Place your concrete foundation and slab. Build or rent forms for your wall concrete placement. Install and tie the reinforcing bars for your walls.Build beam pockets if your ceiling/roof span requires structural steel support beams (refer to engineer's recommendations) to allow these beams to be installed prior to building the roof. Set the exterior forms, shore and align them, and place the concrete for these. Dowel out rebar for the shelter roof from the wall forms. Pour your concrete walls using the same pump you hired for the floor pour. Allow the concrete walls to set/cure a minimum of 7 days before removing the forms. Set up shoring for the roof forms. Finish fabricating and installing all of your tee jacks. Install your rebar reinforcing on top of the platform you have built to act as your ceiling form. Place the bomb shelter roof with concrete. Backfill around the wall perimeter in lifts, using compaction equipment to ensure the soil is compacted in 8 to 12 inch lifts. Backfill the excavation over the roof of the shelter carefully, and avoid using heavy equipment directly over the top of it, especially until the first four or five feet of fill has been installed and compacted. Construct an entrance to your bomb shelter. Finish constructing your entrance tunnel and backfilling the excavation.
This scale is a great way to throw some melodic variation into your lines, and fits neatly over funk, blues, rock, and pop chord progressions. It has a slightly moody, bluesy feel. As always, find the one and three and make them shine, often using the root note. The following is the A-minor pentatonic scale. The note in parenthesis is a grace note, used for a bluesy feel, that can be left out if you want: G|----------5-7-(8)-| D|-----------5---7-| A|-----5-(6)-7-------| E|-5-8-------------|  , The major pentatonic offers the variation loved in pentatonic, but it has a happier feel. It's not quite as bright as the major scale, but it's still a good mood kind of scale and is used accordingly. The following is for the A-major pentatonic scale: G|-----------4---6-| D|-----------4---7-| A|-----4---7-| E|-5-7-------------|, Start the scale on the root note and play from there, using the scale to help your find notes for your licks. The following scale is for A Major, since it starts on the fifth fret (an A): G|-----------------| D|-----------4-6-7-| A|-----4-5-7-------| E|-5-7-------------|, Not used a tone in funk, but still easily modified for funk, this note will give you a bit of a darker, more intense feel for songs that call for it. When played straight, it may sound a little too sad, but that focus on rhythm will give it the pulsing feel that makes it funk. This is for A minor: G|-----------------| D|-------------5-7-| A|-------5-7-----| E|-5-7-8-----------|	Learn the minor pentatonic scale. Learn the major pentatonic scale for a more upbeat feel. Play a major scale for warm, happy tones. Play the minor scale for a darker, sadder tone.
Most living rooms contain a sofa, armchair, side table, and coffee table. Look for these basic elements before adding extra pieces such as ottomans and additional tables.  Look for solid furniture with sturdy wood frames and sinuous steel springs. High-quality pieces may cost a little more, but they tend to hold up better and last longer.  Luxurious, high-quality materials will keep you feeling more comfortable and tend to last longer than cheaper fabrics. Stain-resistant fabrics are especially useful if you have young children, but they might still be a good idea even if you only plan on using the space for guests since spills and stains can happen to anyone.  Foam is comfortable and durable. Some cushions may be filled with down, but down usually breaks and wears quickly.  Lift one leg of the piece about six inches (15 centimeters) off the floor. If the adjacent leg has not risen as well, the frame is too flexible and too flimsy.  Each piece of furniture in your living room should complement the others. Otherwise, your room will look chaotic and thrown together. If you have an interior design theme, such as modern or traditional, stick with pieces that fit with your theme.  There are a number of ways to divide up interior design themes, but the main ones often include modern, contemporary, traditional, casual, and Old World.   Modern and contemporary furniture has sleek, clean lines and usually makes use of white, beige, or other neutral colors. Glass, metal, and shiny black lacquer are used more often than traditional woods. Traditional furniture is elegant. It tends to look a little more formal and may include details like rolled arms and skirted bottoms. Colors range from ivory to rich hues of red and other colors. Casual furniture is friendly and cozy. Many pieces make use of plaid, small prints, and other patterns. Old World furniture combines styles from French, Spanish, and Italian designs. Rustic, antique pieces are especially appropriate, and you should look for deep, earthy colors.  Loveseats typically provide seating for two individuals. If you have a small family or only intend to use the space for entertaining an occasional guest, a loveseat could save you space while providing you with as much as you need.  Chests, flat-top ottomans, and extra tables or seating can add a lot to a large living room, but too many of these pieces will crowd out a smaller space.	Start with the basics. Buy investment pieces. Look for high-quality, stain-resistant fabrics. Look for cushions made of wrapped foam. Test the strength of the frame. Coordinate your pieces. Know your themes. Opt for a loveseat instead of a sofa if you have a smaller space. Fill the room in with additional pieces as space allows.
Create one mound for each rhizome you will be planting. The mounds should be spaced about 3 feet (0.9 m) apart, so the hops have plenty of room to grow.  Dig a 4-inch hole in each mound. Plant the rhizomes horizontally, with the root side down. Mound soil over the rhizomes and loosely pack it down, then cover with straw or a light mulch to inhibit weed growth. Keep the soil consistently moist until the hops begin to sprout.  When the hops emerge and grow about 6 inches (15.2 cm), they need to be "trained" around the trellis you are using to help them grow vertically. Place the trellis near the plants and gently wrap them around its base.   Continue training the hops for a few days. After awhile, they'll begin growing clockwise around the trellis on their own. If some of the shoots that sprout look damaged or weak, remove them, rather than allowing them to take up space on the trellis. Each rhizome should produce between 4 and 6 healthy vines.  After a few months of growth, trim the leaves off the bottom 4 feet (1.2 m) of the bines. This prevents the plants from getting damaged by diseases or fungus that may be present in the soil.  As the vines begin to grow tall and strong, keep the soil around them weeded. Water the hops every day so that the soil stays moist, but not drenched. Continue caring for the hops in this way until late summer, when it's time to harvest them.	Mound the soil. Plant the hops. Train the bines. Trim the bines. Care for the plants.
To make a pyramid, you need to start with paper that has equal dimensions in the length and width. The thicker the paper, the more durable the pyramid, but if you go too thick, the pyramid will be difficult to fold. Good paper choices include:   Origami paper Construction paper Cardstock; , First, fold and unfold it diagonally through the center from top right to bottom left, and then diagonally through the center from the top left to bottom right., Look at the folds you’ve made (the paper will be folded into four triangles). Either with a pencil or in your mind, label the four folds that divide the paper into quarters as A, B, C, and D (in order, going counter-clockwise).  You want the paper in front of you so that the triangle labeled side D and A has its bottom edge facing you.  Start by folding the left side of the triangle in half in on itself, so the outer edges of sides C and D meet. Repeat on the other side, so that the outer edges of sides A and B meet., Start on one side, and fold the bottom corners in toward the center, so that each bottom corner comes to meet the top corner. Repeat on the other side.  Orient the square so it looks like a diamond, with all the folded flaps at the top and the neat bottom point facing you. On each side of the paper, fold the two side points of the diamond in to the center so the bottom edge of the diamond lines up with the center edge of the square.  On each of the four kite faces, open each fold one at a time until you get a small right triangle sticking out the back of your fold. Fold this little triangle down over the front, and then refold all the original folds. Repeat with each kite face.  Fold it back and forth to create a nice crease.Now, stand the kite up on the bottom tip, and gently press the center tip at the top. The paper should begin opening up and unfolding at the base at the last crease you made. Once it unfolds into a triangle, you can square off the edges of the base and the sides of your paper pyramid. , Either use a square piece of paper to create your own template, or print one off and use it as either the paper for the pyramid or a cut-out template that you can trace onto a different piece of paper.   A proper pyramid template pattern will have a square base, and off each side of that base there will be an attached triangle. Two or all four of these triangles will have tabs on them. Once cut out, the four triangles will come together and join at the top to form the pyramid faces.  The tabs on the side are important (so don’t cut them off) because these will be used to glue or tape the sides of the pyramid together.  Now that the pattern has been cut, you have the basic shape for your pyramid, and it can now be decorated any way you like. Remember that the faces on the underside of the paper will become the outside, so be sure to decorate the right side!   Try drawing an overlapping grid pattern to make it look like the bricks of an Egyptian pyramid.  After decorating, flip the pyramid back over to create creases so that the faces will come together nicely. Make sure to direct the creases inward, and don’t forget to crease the tabs as well. ]   If you are using thicker paper, such as cardboard, consider using a hobby knife or scissors to gently trace the lines where the pyramid will bend and fold.  Apply glue or tape to the outside edges (the decorated side edges) of all the tabs. Bring the four faces of the pyramid together, securing them to each other by positioning the sticky tabs on the inside of the pyramid faces.Gently press the sides to the tabs and allow the glue to dry.	Find a square piece of paper. Fold and unfold the paper. Lay the paper flat on a table. Orient the paper. Fold the paper into a smaller triangle. Fold the triangle into a square. Fold the square into a kite. Anchor the folds. Fold down the tip of the kite. Finished!  , Print or draw a pyramid template. Cut out your pyramid pattern. Flip the paper over and decorate. Crease all the pyramid edges. Form the pyramid.
Use the remote or close the door manually. This will allow you to access the tracks and the rest of the moving parts on your door.  Before lubricating your door, you'll want to make sure that it's not on. Disconnect your garage door from the power source, after you close it., The tracks are the what the garage door rollers ride on to open and close. You don't want to lubricate these, but you do want to make sure that they are completely cleaned out for your door to operate correctly. Wipe down the inside of both tracks and remove any dirt and debris.Make sure that there are no debris left in your tracks that the rollers can get stuck on.  If you are having issues getting debris out of the tracks, you can use a vacuum with a hose extension to suck out the dirt and debris. This is a great solution to reach the higher portion of the tracks that you may be having issues reaching., Popular standard degreasers like WD-40 isn't the best option for a garage door. Instead, purchase a lithium based grease at a hardware store or online. There are also certain greases that are made specifically for garage doors. Do not use oil.Garage door grease will typically come in an aerosol or spray can. Oil is susceptible to dirt and dust buildup and is more likely to drip than garage door grease or lube. Read the label to make sure that the grease that you are using is appropriate for your doors.  Slowly lift your garage door up manually and spray down the hinges as it meets the bend of the track. This will lubricate the moving parts on the door and will make opening and closing the garage door much smoother. Use one or two sprays on each hinge. Your hinges should be covered in lubricant., The rollers are the circular moving pieces on your garage door and are attached to each of your hinges. Inside of these rollers are small ball bearings that need to be lubricated for your door to open and close smoothly. Use the thin hose attachment to spray the grease inside of the rollers.Any exposed ball bearings must be thoroughly lubricated.  The springs can usually be found at the top of the garage door and must be fully lubricated as well. The bearing plates are the moving circular parts on both sides of the springs. Spray down the outside of the springs and near the center of the bearing plates, then open and close your garage door to spread the grease around.You will most likely need a step ladder to reach the springs and bearing plates. If your springs are making noises, you need to grease your springs.  Lubricating the lock will make locking your garage door easier, and can prevent rust in the long run. Point the lubricant towards the lock's keyhole and spray it once to lubricate it. Once you're done lubricating the lock, finish lubricating your garage door by spraying the grease on the large armbar at the top of your door., The rail is the portion that your chain rides on and should run along your garage's ceiling. The top portion of the rail is what your chain actually rides along, so it's the part that needs to be lubricated. Spray down the top of the rail and then spread the grease around with a rag.The chain comes with a natural protectant on it that makes it so that you don't have to grease it regularly. Spraying the bottom of the rail doesn't do anything.	Close the garage door. Cut power to the door. Clean out the tracks with a damp rag. Vacuum out dirt and dust from your tracks. Purchase a lithium based grease or garage door lube. Open your door and spray the lubricant on each of the hinges. Lubricate the rollers. Spray the outside of your springs and bearing plates. Spray the lock and armbar. Lubricate the top of the rail.
Use a half-gallon (2 L) mixing container and combine both of the liquid ingredients together. Stir vigorously, but don't create air bubbles.   If you need more glycerin solution, use a ratio of 1:2 glycerin to warm water and adjust the rest of the ingredients accordingly., These ingredients will make up your dye mixture and will be added to the glycerin and water mixture after. Pour 1/2 cup (4 oz.) of hot water, 1 tsp. (4.92 ml) of floral dye, and 1 tsp. (4.92 ml) of citric acid in a separate bowl. Stir continuously until the mixture is dissolved. Once you've mixed them together, combine them to your half-gallon (2 L) mixing container and continue to both liquid solutions together until they are well incorporated.The dye will help the plant to retain its natural color. If you don't use dye your boxwood cuttings will turn a golden hue.  You can pack as many boxwood cuttings into a single container that you want, as long as you have enough glycerin solution. For every ounce (28 g) of cuttings add 1 fluid ounce (0.125 cup) of glycerin solution in the container. Weigh your boxwood cuttings on a scale so that you know how much of the solution has to go into each container.   Using the correct amount of solution will ensure that the cuttings will be flexible and won't run out of solution to absorb.  Get the container that you set aside previously for your boxwood cuttings and pour the glycerin solution into the container. Use a measuring cup to make sure that you're pouring the right amount of solution into the container.   For instance, if you had 10 ounces (280 g) of boxwood cuttings, you'd need 10 fluid ounces (1.25 cups) of the solution.	Mix 2 cups (16 oz) of warm water with 1 cup (8 oz) of glycerin. Mix floral dye, citric acid, and 1/2 cup (4 oz) of hot water together. Weigh the boxwood cuttings. Pour the proper amount of solution into your container.
The unspoken rule of metal concerts is, however, not to wear the shirt for the band you are going to see. Find a band shirt for a similar band in the same genre as the one you are going to see. Black t-shirts or tank tops with graphic designs are always good choices for a rock or metal show. Avoid anything that isn't cotton. If you are moshing or in a large crowd you will definitely sweat!  , Keep in mind, rockers mix feminine and masculine in their looks, its going to be the accessories that tie this look together.   Match your tee with dark green, dark blue, black or dark purple jeans. If you want to style up your look a little more, try swapping jeans for a peplum skirt or fitted red mini. Either of these provides a feminine chic look. Plaid miniskirts are especially popular at punk rock concerts. If you are going to a heavy metal concert and plan to be in the mosh pit, wear jeans rather than a skirt. , Military boots, and dark sneakers are all rocker-chic.   Again, you want comfort as concerts are typically in packed areas. Nevertheless, this look lends itself to flats rather than heels. Try to wear shoes with a thicker material at the toe. Your feet will be stomped on quite a bit. Experienced metal heads advise to always wear combat boots to a heavy metal concert. Even sneakers won't protect your feet from all the stomping! , Keep in mind that rock looks combine masculine and feminine styles. The accessories are really a chance to make your look more feminine.   Layer bracelets (cuffs, leather bands, studded bangles, and jeweled wrap-arounds) until you have an eclectic look. Leather studded cuffs and belts are always good accessories for a rock or metal concert. Earrings should be minimal studs. Avoid long necklaces. If you are moshing or dancing at a rock concert, these can get pulled. , Simple light make-up and simple hairstyles are best, though. If you are dancing or moshing, your makeup might run. Wear waterproof makeup if possible. Avoid curling your hair too much, as this style isn't really in fashion for a rock or metal look. Ponytails and braids are simple and practical hairstyles for a rock or metal show.Brightly colored hair and mohawk styles are popular for a punk rock look.	Get a rock band or heavy metal band t-shirt. Match your bottom. Get the right shoes. Build the look with accessories. Hair and make up can be worn to personal preference.
While just about any type of herb will do well in a container, not all vegetables will. You can buy mature plants from a nursery or you can start them from seeds. Here are the types of herbs and vegetables that do well in container gardens:Herbs, such as basil, mint, and thyme. You can even plant a bunch in a large planter for a mini garden. All salad greens, such as collards, lettuce, mustard, and Swiss chard. Harvest only the outer layers. Tomatoes, eggplants, and peppers all do well in summer pots, but will need supports or cages. Cucumbers, zucchini, and other types of squash will also work. Cucumbers can also climb a trellis to save space.; , This is important, otherwise the soil will become waterlogged and lead to root rot, which can kill your plant. Your planter can be made out of anything: wood, plastic, clay, etc. Keep in mind, however, that wood planters don't last for more than a few seasons. Also, if you live in a hot, dry climate, stay away from terracotta; they dry out too quickly and soak up too much moisture.   If you absolutely must have a terracotta planter, get one that is sealed on the inside.  Short, wide pots are good for shallow-rooted, plants such as lettuce, while large, tall pots are good for vegetables, such as a zucchini or pumpkin. Half-size wine barrels also make great containers.A 10-inch (25.4 centimeters) pot is best for herbs and small plants, like strawberries and lettuce. A 14-inch (35.56 centimeters) pot is great for herbs and salad greens, like spinach, non-heading lettuce, and arugula plants. An 18-inch (45.72 centimeters) pot is good for small vegetables, such as broccoli, cauliflower, eggplant, and small peppers. It can also hold salad greens and herbs in small bunches. A 24-inch (60.96 centimeters) pot is best for large vegetables, such as cucumber, squash, and tomatoes. It can also hold small bunches of small vegetables and herbs.  This will prevent the soil from falling out while allowing the water to pass through. You can use a scrap of burlap, window screening, or even a coffee filter.   You will also want to place a dish under the planter to catch any excess water and keep your floor or patio clean.  Different plants will have different needs; some plants need a well-draining soil while others need a water-retaining soil. In general, however, you should look for soil that is light, fluffy, and holds moisture well.Consider looking for ingredients, such as: aged bark, lime, perlite, sphagnum peat moss, and vermiculite. They will make the soil more expensive, but they will ensure the healthiest crops.Added wetting agents will help the soil stay evenly damp. Fertilizers are great additions, but you will need to add more fertilizer later on; it doesn't last forever! If you have thirsty plants, such as vegetables, consider getting a specially-formulated soil that retains water., Make sure to have some extra soil on hand, as the soil will compress a little once you water it. Do not pack or press down on the soil, however. Instead, gently tap the pot against the ground, or rock it side-to-side, to collapse any air pockets., Carefully take your plant out of the container it came in, and make a hole in the soil large enough to hold the plant's root ball. Place the plant into the hole, and gently pat the soil around it.   If you are starting your garden from seeds, then sow the seeds according to the directions on the seed packet. At this point, you can also add cage or supports, if needed.  The soil will compress 15 to 20%, so you will have to add more soil on top and water again.Keep doing this until the soil level is 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) from the rim of the pot.   Add some liquid plant food to the water for a nutritional boost., Water them when the top inch (2.54 centimeters) of soil is dry. If you find that the soil is drying out too fast, add some mulching on top, such as fine bark or straw. If you live in a humid climate, use white pebbles instead; hey will dry out faster and prevent root rot.Fertilize only when necessary, and be sure to use the right type of fertilizer for your herb or vegetable. Each plant will have different requirements. Make sure that your plants are getting around 5 hours of direct sunlight each day. Some plants, such as cabbage, can live in shaded areas. Others, such as cucumbers, thrive in full sun.	Buy the right herbs or vegetables to plant in your container garden. Choose a planter with drainage holes at the bottom. Make sure that the planter is the right shape and size for your plant. Cover the drainage hole with a porous material. Choose a good soil suitable for the type of plant you are growing. Fill the pot with soil 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) from the rim. Add your plants, and fill the spaces with more soil. Water the soil until water starts to leak out of the bottom of the pot. Take care of your herbs or vegetables.
Winter weather will find the overlooked weakness if your preparation is incomplete.  Coolant systems that are not in the right proportion will lead to overheating due to freezing. Have the car's coolant system flushed in the fall before the first freeze. You also need to check the system for leaks and install fresh coolant.  Protect your paint job, guard against ice on the windshield (see tips), and guard against the fluids and/or water in your radiator from freezing. And, yes, there is such a thing as “gas line freeze”. Condensation builds up in the gas line and gas tank, and freezes. (You may want to inquire with an auto parts store about a head bolt heater.)   If you do not have shelter for your car, invest in a car cover. Try to find one that is reversible – with one side a very bright color such as orange, yellow and in neon shades. A car cover will not save you from freezing fluids, but it will keep snow and ice off the windshield and your paint, and help protect your car from salts that might be used on the streets in your community. , Change the windshield wiper fluid with one that has antifreeze added to it.  The cold weather puts unusual demands on the charging system.    An older car in an area that has temperatures that fall below freezing often uses 30-weight single viscosity oil. You need to go to a lower viscosity oil, like a 10-weight, when the temperature falls below zero and stays there. This also applies to your automatic transmission fluid. Higher weight oils and transmission fluids do not lubricate sufficiently in colder weather. Newer automobiles use multi-viscosity oil such as 10 and 30 weights. This eliminates the need to change type of oil.  (Like overnight.) The warm air in your tires rises. As it cools the bottom of the tire goes “flat”. This will resolve itself once you begin to drive and the air starts to circulate again. But start off slowly. Consult with a tire retailer about snow tires and chains.   Ensure traction so you know you are safe when driving on icy roads. Check your vehicle's tire treads. Replace any tires that do not have sufficient tread. Snow tires may also be a good investment.  Know where you are. Before you leave your starting point, advise a family member, friend or neighbor of your destination and judge the approximate duration of the trip. If possible, contact those persons if you will be delayed. Notify them when you reach your destination.; , If no such item can be found, apply a very large X on the roof section of the car cover. This can be achieved with vinyl, waterproof tape or take the car cover to an upholster to have a durable, highly reflective vinyl X sewn on. On the front and rear sides of the cover, use the same methods to apply your license plate number. When not in use, keep the car cover in the trunk.  This will provide added traction while driving and the sand can be used around your tires if you become stuck.)       A camping shovel       At least one sleeping bag, preferably one that is down.       Water       Foodstuffs that can be eaten cold. (Described in Item number 4.) A small First Aid kit A small tool kit, a jack that works and a spare tire in usable condition, and jumper cables.  If it has reception, call an emergency number first, then call the persons that are aware of your route and your travel time schedule. Test the cell phone periodically. Do not try to walk over for help. Exit the car ONLY to recover items from the trunk.  Position the X on the roof the best you can. The car cover will help retain heat inside the car and repel the cold, wind, and drafts. If you are in a severe situation, the reflective X can by seen by aircraft that may be conducting a search for you. Your license plate numbers will be visible to a search and rescue team working on the ground.	Prepare your car for winter driving according to the worst weather you can expect in your area. Check your anti-freeze. If you have a garage, use it for sheltering your car. Confirm that your heater system works correctly and the core doesn't leak, the blower works and the window defroster is operating.  , Inspect the windshield wipers and replace them if they are worn or have become hardened. Examine the car's electrical system, particularly the battery and charging arrangement. Maintain fluids regularly. Expect to have “square tires” after you have had the car sitting for a while. Avoid driving in weather conditions such as a blizzard, extreme cold and high winds or in rural areas of your community. In item number 2, it was noted that a car cover should be of a bright, neon color on one side. Prepare an emergency kit to keep in your trunk containing:  Flares       Flashlight and batteries (keep in the glove box or inside the vehicle)       Candles and a lighter or matches (keep them dry in a sealed, plastic bag       Battery operated radio       Spare batteries for your cellphone and flashlight       2 bags of sand (one on each side of the trunk, near the wheel wells. If you become stranded in your car, FIRST test your cell phone. Put the car cover on the vehicle with the bright, reflective X side out.
Writing about your own experiences is always the best way to go, because you'll know how the song should feel. If you want your song to tell a story, think about each part of that story and how it feels. Make sure the story isn't too complicated, because it will be hard to understand.; , If it is a sad song, it should normally be slow. Happy songs don't have to be fast, but they are normally higher and always in the major key. If it is a dark song, it will sound great in the minor key. You can even add some chords that clash if they sound appropriate to the mood of the song and you know what you are doing. If you don't have very much musical experience, experiment and see what sound you think reflects how your song should make listeners feel.  Keep trying until you find one that is best for your song. Then see if you can find chords that go well with your melody. It won't sound as impressive if it doesn't have some chords. If putting the two together is too hard, you could just sing the melody and only play the chords. A lot of songs are like this and they sound lovely. If you don't have a piano, you can do this with another instrument or skip this step. Just plan out a melody or chorus for your song.  Make sure it is the kind of melody that will sound good with words, because some melodies sound good on an instrument but not with lyrics.  Sing each line as your write it down making sure it has the right amount of syllables. You don't always have to rhyme but some here and there sound good, as long as your rhymes make sense and don't sound like you only put them there because you couldn't think of anything better that rhymed. Repeating a stanza a few times can be nice and it helps people recognize your song faster and be able to sing it.  Touch up anything that sounds unsatisfactory. Now you have yourself a good song that came from the heart.	Think about what you want to write about. Once you know what you want to write about, start thinking about songs you've heard, with the same kind of feeling. If you have a piano, try making a basic melody. Hum your melody and add things to it until you are satisfied. Start writing your story. Put the music and Lyrics together.
Once kudzu gets going it is very hard to stop and remove. Instead, it is best to watch out for the boundaries of your land and kill any kudzu that crosses over. Some people build a stone wall, but you’ll still need to pull the vines down.Be aware that kudzu seeds can also spread deep in the ground.  Instead of chopping down vines, which can make the kudzu spread even more, erect natural barriers instead. Pile grass clippings or wood pieces around the perimeter of the land. Reinforce these barriers as often as possible to prevent encroachment., If you try to kill kudzu with chemicals, you will likely fail. Kudzu has shown itself to be very resistant to plant and weed killers. Do not apply any herbicides to kudzu that you plan to harvest for consumption.  As with most plants, kudzu does require light and oxygen in order to survive and grow. Try to kill off the kudzu by robbing it of these things by covering it up. Smother it by placing a blanket of grass clippings over the base roots. Get a tarp or plastic sheet and cover the entire kudzu plant., Bring some goats into the area and let them free graze. They are capable of eating vast amounts of kudzu shoots, significantly lessening new growth. Goats are also very capable of navigating the rough terrain that kudzu often grows in.	Keep it away from your land. Build mulch barriers. Practice caution when applying herbicide. Smother it. Let animals feed on it.
; , Fold the corner inwards on the inner fold line.  Leave a small seam allowance.  Slip stitch the diagonal line of the mitre and hem. You're done.	Fold and press (iron) the hem of the item to be mitred. Open out the hem. Cut off the corner. Refold the hem.
One of the easiest ways of all to keep your room warmer is to use the sun, mother nature's original space heater. In general, you'll want to allow as much warm sunlight into your room as possible during the day and to prevent that warmth from leaving at night. For best results, you'll also need to know which windows in your room the sun shines through — generally, these are south-facing windows in the Northern Hemisphere and north-facing windows in the Southern Hemisphere.Here's simple sample schedule you may want to use:    Morning: Before you leave for work or school, close all of your room's windows. Open the blinds all the way.  Afternoon: Leave your blinds open until sun stops shining into your room. As soon as it starts to get dark and cold, close the blinds.  Night: Keep the blinds and windows closed throughout the night to preserve heat.; , In a world where the climate impact of household practices is becoming a bigger concern, many environment-conscious consumers are choosing to heat the person, not the room. Wearing a coat, a jacket, or some sweat pants indoors is a great way to stay warm without using an ounce of heating energy (or spending a penny on your heating bill.)   If your room is especially cold at night, you might try wearing layers at night. Though some people find this uncomfortable, soft garments like sweatpants and "hoodie" sweatshirts usually give the most warmth without sacrificing much comfort. Artificial fabrics that don't "breathe" like polyester, rayon, and so on generally trap the most heat (this is why they're so uncomfortable in the summer).  One of the worst feelings in the world is navigating an ice-cold room in your pajamas only to slide into a sub-zero bed. While your bed should heat up once you're in it, you can avoid this awful feeling by heating it up before you get in. A hot water bottle is one great way to do this — simply fill it with steaming water, close the lid tight, and leave it in the center of your bed under the covers 15 minutes before you go to bed.. As it cools, it will dissipate heat into your bed, leaving it nice and toasty when you get in.   Medical water bottles are available at many pharmacies for around $15 or less. If you're using a microwave to heat your water, be sure to use a microwave-safe container (like a glass or ceramic bowl).  The last thing you want when you're trying to heat a room is a draft (sometimes spelled "draught"), a spot where cool air can leak into the room. Keep any drafts plugged up with spare rags or blankets while you're waiting for a more permanent solution (like replacing a leaky window, etc.) When drafts are especially bad, this simple fix can make a big difference.   Not sure whether you have a draft? There are several ways to discover them. One is simply to hold your hand near a crack in a window or door and feel for the motion of air. You can also use a candle — if its flame flickers near a crack, you have a draft. Try the U.S. Government's draft-detecting tips at energy.gov for more ideas.  Do you have a heater or radiator in your room that doesn't seem to be making a difference when it comes to keeping you warm? Use these tips to increase their effectiveness (and save you money you'd otherwise be wasting):   Make sure there are no pieces of furniture between the heater or radiator and yourself. For instance, many older houses hide radiators behind couches. Put a sheet of tinfoil behind a radiator (use a sheet about the same a size as the radiator itself). This reflects heat that would normally be transmitted into the wall, heating the rest of the room. If your heater is portable, use it in the smallest space possible so that it can most effectively heat you. For instance, a space heater will heat a small bedroom much better than it will heat a large living room.  It's easy to forget that human beings are essentially walking, talking, biological furnaces, constantly emitting heat into the air around them. Bringing an extra person or two into the room can make a noticeable distance — your combined body heat and the heat of your exhalation will help warm the room.   Two things are important to keep in mind with this method: the smaller the room and the more physically active the people in it, the warmer it will get. In other words, a lively party in a small room will produce a lot more heat than a few people sitting on couches in a large living room. If your friends are busy, even pets can make a room a little warmer (unless they're cold-blooded — fish and lizards aren't helpful here).  This trick may seem a little ridiculous, but it does work. After all, a hair dryer is essentially a small space heater with a fan in it. You can blow hot air directly onto your bed or lift up the covers and point the hairdryer underneath to create a pocket of warm air for you to lie in.   Be careful not to touch the hot metal elements at the end of your hair dryer with your bedsheets, especially if they're made of a fabric that's prone to melting (like polyester, etc.)	Use your windows and blinds to warm your room with sunlight. Wear layers for energy-free heating. Put hot water bottle in your bed. Plug drafts with spare blankets. Make the most of existing heaters or radiators. Invite people into the room. Get a hair dryer and lightly blow the bed with the dryer.
Child-safe glue like Elmer's Glue is also made from PVA; however, it is a low-quality version of the product. Ask for bookbinder's glue to ensure you are getting a strong, durable product.   It is a good idea to choose a neutral PH adhesive. This non-acidic glue will not deteriorate the paper that you plan to glue to your wood.; ,, If you are using a very thin paper, you may find that the glue needs to be thinned in order to avoid bubbling.   You can thin the glue by adding water to it in another container. Add slowly and stir until you reach the desired consistency.  If you have painted the wood, it will be much harder to adhere the paper and you should make sure to use the glue in its original form.  Depending upon the size of the project, you may want to ask a friend to help you line it up.  Apply it to the wood's surface until you have a consistent, thin layer.  Make sure to get all corners. You can wipe up overlapping glue.    If you have extra paper, you can overlap the paper over the wood to ensure a good even surface. After it has dried, you can cut a clean edge with a razor knife and mat.  You can also wear plastic gloves and smooth the paper with your hands.  Trim the edges, if necessary.	Buy an archival polyvinyl acetate (PVA) glue from a craft shop. Wash your hands so that they are clear of all lotions and oils.  , Thin the bookbinder's glue, if need be. Prepare the wood so that it is clean and dry. Prepare the paper nearby on a hard surface. Dip a sponge or sponge brush in the PVA adhesive. Apply the PVA to the brush again and spread a thin layer on the paper's surface. Align and place the paper on the wood. Smooth the paper onto the wood with a soft, dry sponge. Allow the glue to dry overnight. Wash your sponge or sponge brush immediately after you use them to avoid hardening.
Make sure your bender is designed for EMT conduit of the size you are using. Even a universal bender may require attaching a shoe and/or follow bar designed for EMT.This article focuses on hand benders. If you are using a hydraulic or power bender (recommended for conduit with a nominal size over 2 inches), find instructions for your specific bender model. Hickey benders tend to crush or kink EMT conduit. Use a bender with a curved track for the conduit to slot into.; , A stub up bend is a 90º bend near the end of the conduit. Measure the distance on the wall from the end of the conduit to the position of the bend.  The radius of the bend will add extra length to the bent end of your conduit. Take this into account by subtracting a certain amount from your measurement:If you are using ½" EMT conduit, subtract 5" (12.7 cm). ¾" conduit: subtract 6" (15.2 cm). 1" conduit: subtract 8" (20.3 cm. 1¼" conduit: subtract 11" (27.9 cm).  Place your conduit on the floor. Measure from the end of the conduit to the new length you calculated, and mark the conduit at this point. Line the arrow symbol on your bender up so it points to this mark. Slot your bender onto the conduit. Make sure the bender handle is angled toward the end you measured from.   If your bender does not have an arrow symbol, you may need to find the instructions for your  , Your foot should provide most if not all of the pressure. Without pulling, use one hand to steady the handle on your bender, and the other to steady the conduit end once it rises within reach. Apply firm, constant foot pressure, as a pause could create a kink in your conduit.Bend until the end of the conduit is vertical, or very slightly past vertical.   If your conduit is 1¼" or larger, you may need an assistant to operate the handle.  Attach a level to the vertical length of conduit. If necessary, make small adjustments to the bend until the bubble of the level is centered. The conduit will flex back slightly after you remove the bender, so bending slightly too far will provide the best results.	Select the correct bender. Measure the desired length of the stub. Subtract the take-up height. Line the arrow mark on your bender to this measurement. Press down on the foot pedal to bend the conduit. Confirm the bend with a spirit level (recommended).

Look at public train schedules and maps for your city to see if they cover routes serving your origin and destination. You’ll save time, spend less money on fuel and parking, and cut down on pollution. Plus, you can read, relax, or get work done during the commute.  While not always as efficient as rail, metropolitan bus networks commonly serve broader areas, and can save you money on fuel and parking. On the highway and in city streets, buses can sometimes take advantage of bus-only lanes that bypass traffic.  If you live fairly close to work, try going there by bicycle instead of driving. You might find that your travel time is not much different from when you were driving to and from work in traffic. Plus you’ll get some fresh air, save money on fuel, and get a good amount of exercise.  Alternative modes of transportation such as biking, walking, and busing will be much more practical if you can manage to live as close as possible to your place of work. But if locating close to your job isn’t an option, at least try to live near a public transportation route that connects your residence and place of work.	Take advantage of rail systems. Try taking the bus. Consider riding your bike. Find a residence close to work.
You can also do it to more, just make sure the number of spoons is divisible by four. , Do this with the other groups of three spoons.    You can also use more spoon tops on the top or bottom of the butterfly to create different sized wings. For example, to have bigger top wings than bottom ones, you would have three spoons for each wing on the top and two spoons for each wing on the bottom.  You may also paint the spoons (make sure the paint can adhere to the plastic.) If you're going to paint the spoons, you will need a couple coats of paint so the butterfly will look bright — so there won't be any streaky bits of plastic showing.	Repeat Steps 1 to 2 in the first method (the simple butterfly), but instead of using four spoons, do this to 12 spoons. Use the handle of one of the spoons as the body again.  , For the wings, glue three of the spoon tops together to create a wing shape. Let the glue dry, then attach the wing shaped spoon tops to the body. Decorate your butterfly with jewels, glitter, or sharpies as desired.
Many owner's manuals never even mention steering fluid, and despite the urging of some mechanics, there is growing disagreement that a full flush is really needed for most cars.If the fluid doesn't smell burnt and there are no metallic bits in the fluid, you can get by with a simpler "flush."   If your fluid is dark or you are losing sleep worrying about your car, this simple procedure will refresh your fluid for the foreseeable future., This is usually labeled with a steering wheel icon on the cap.  Note the color and consistency of the fluid. If it smells burnt or has bits of metal in it, you'll need to do a full flush of the system. Note the current level of the fluid.  This will take some time, and you will not get everything, but this is a simple and easy way to get old fluid out without a complicated flush., This simple procedure will protect your car, cheaply, and is just as effective a method as a full flush if you have no other problems. The power steering system is, relatively speaking, rather clean and simple. Unlike other fluids, like oil, the power steering system doesn't even need a filter. This quick "refresher" is likely all you'll need to do to keep your wheels turning easily.   Many cars don't even recommend changing this fluid — you'll be ahead of the game if you even do this.  Drive the car around, recirculating the fluid, and repeat a few weeks later if you want a full "flush." This won't get everything out, but more than enough to keep your car running happily.	Recognize that flushing power steering is not necessarily essential. Locate the power steering fluid reservoir on your engine. Mark the current level and condition of the power steering fluid. Use a turkey baster to suction the old fluid out of the reservoir. Refill the reservoir to its prior level with fresh fluid. Repeat the process a few weeks later to fully refresh the fluid.
Run your washing machine and allow it to fill with hot water. Use the highest load size when doing this as well., Open the lid while the washer is running. Use a measuring cup to measure and pour four cups (946.35 ml) of white vinegar into the washer as it fills., For an even deeper cleaning, you can add baking soda to the water. Measure out a cup (236.58 ml) of baking soda and carefully pour it into the water in your machine., Allowing your machine to run will let the vinegar and baking soda wash away a lot of the dirt and grime on the inside of your washing machine., Letting the hot water and vinegar sit in your washing machine for an hour will help pull away leftover grime and dirt from within the machine., Use a clean cloth and citrus cleaner to wash down the rest of your washing machine. Citrus cleaners are great at removing limescale, soap scum and buildup. You can purchase citrus cleaners at the store or you can make them at home. Spray the cleaner in dirty areas and use the cloth to wipe up the grime and dirt.Citrus cleaners use the natural properties found in fruits like lemons, oranges, and limes to remove dirt. When cleaning, make sure to wipe off the fabric softener and bleach reservoirs that are on your washer. You can also use a toothbrush to get to hard to reach places.  Close the lid and finish the cycle in your washing machine. Wait until the cycle completes and all the water has drained from the machine.  Finish cleaning out the interior of the washing machine with a dry rag. Once it's dry, you can repeat the steps to finish cleaning the remaining dirt or gunk that's built up inside of your machine.	Set your washing machine to the hottest temperature and longest cycle. Add four cups (946.35 ml) of white vinegar to the washer. Pour a cup (236.58 ml) of baking soda to the water. Close the lid and let the washing machine run for 5 minutes. Open the lid and pause the machine for an hour. Wipe the outside of your machine while your machine is paused. Finish the washing machine's cycle. Wipe down the interior of the machine and repeat.
Metal is considered a "counter-culture," meaning it opposes "the normal, functional, and unexciting Culture that was dominant in society by being outside of that which was in power, Counter-culturalists argued, they were able to see what was real." So when you before you begin writing, erase any preconceived notions that you have about a particular topic.  Metal music focuses on darker topics that match the heaviness of the music and skirt the "popular" beliefs of society. The topics often challenge the listeners’ political, religious, emotional, philosophical, and/or social beliefs. Select a topic that you have experience with or have a strong connection to, this is going to make the rest of the process much easier.   Popular topics for metal songs include war, personal angst, mental disease, mythology, tragedy, death, hate, intolerance, corruption and love.  Once you have selected the topic, you want to spend time formulating what your thoughts on the subject are. Unlike popular music, metal pulls from real "truths" rather than perceived "morals" or popular "beliefs" on the subject.    Start with what is "society's perspective." Think of what the culture promotes as the correct "belief" or "moral" in the discussion of that topic. It will be easier if you can find a belief that you find to be counter-intuitive, paradoxical or illogical such "war for peace," "religiously-motivated murder," or "victim-blaming."  Contrast that to examples based on experience. Take a real life, personal or a fictional example that challenges the mainstream beliefs behind this topic. How has your experience challenged society's view?  Make note of any other arguments, perspectives, or facts surrounding this topic. What kind of things do people say about the subject? What promotes these beliefs? What are the consequences behind this ethical belief? Who does this affect?  Find a "truth" within the topic. Based solely on the examples that challenge that perspective, what truths can you logically pull out? This truth will become the main thrust of your song.  Unlike other popular music, there is not a standard song format such as "verse-chorus-verse-chorus." Instead, create your own structure based on the topic. Is there an important message that can be repeated?Do you want to provide the listener with a resolution? Here are some basic elements of the dramatic structure you can include:    What is the rising action? What examples or personal experiences can you include to bring the listener to agree with your song's main "truth"?  What is the climax? Can you create a moment where the listener can throw out the societal norms or absolute "morals" that they had?  What is the resolution? What did these examples teach the listener? What did you learn?  , Don't stick to "rhyming patterns" or "rules behind poetry." Many popular metal songs don't necessarily rhyme or follow traditionally. Instead just weave together the basic parts you created in the last step. Tell your "story" to the listener.  Literary devices that work particularly well in metal music include personification, allegories, figurative language, imagery, metaphors and synecdoches. Some helpful ways to find out what devices will work with your topic include:   What popular images are associated with that topic? (Metaphors, allegories, personification, synecdoches, etc.) What observations can you pull from this topic? (Imagery, etc.) Is there fiction or mythology that you can pull from? (Metaphors, allegories, etc.)  , Use wikiHow to Write Power Metal Music to create the sound behind your lyrics.  Sometimes the music doesn't match up with the sound. So play the music and sing the lyrics to find where these inconsistencies are. Then edit either the music or the sound to fit the emotion behind what you are saying/hearing.  Their fans were often disenfranchised youth who felt no connection to the free-love movement of the 1970s or the societal norms of the 1970s. They discussed topics that directly affected these youths and were relevant to what was going on in the world during that time.; , This topic was perfect for the period where America used military force to achieve political change. In choosing this, they could speak out against the basic "American" beliefs behind the war effort.    Societal beliefs: Society believed that war could bring peace.  Experiences: War breeds more pain, suffering and destruction. Politicians start war, because they don't have to deal with those tragedies themselves.  Other observations: It's the poor that fight, people die in masses, the generals guide soldier into certain death.  The "truth": Politicians have the power and misuse it.  They really focused less on rhyming and more on creating a vivid story with a rise, climax and a resolution.    Rising Action: "Generals gathered in their masses," "In the fields the bodies burning," and "Evil minds that plot destruction" are all examples of realistic experiences and observations that Black Sabbath pulled from.  Climax: "Politicians hide themselves away" and "Wait 'til their judgement day comes" support that from the examples, politicians will eventually be held responsible for what they did.  Resolution: "Now in darkness world stops turning," and "No more war pigs have the power" explain that eventually the people will rise up, and take back the power from the politicians. This provides a solution to the problems that existed in the rising action.  Finding ways to make the lines fit together and to create a "story." They tied the rising action to the climax with the "oh lord yeah" which foreshadows the resolution of judgement day.  Black Sabbath changed these experiences and facts surrounding war into something more meaningful and symbolic with literary devices. They weaved these ideas throughout the song, focusing on the main literary device of personification of "war pigs."   Popular images of "tanks," "machines," and "battle fields" are all references in the song. Observations like the masses being gathered and a chess game being played are also depicted. Fictitious and mythological images of "sorcerers" and "witches" are used in the song.	Understand the meaning behind Metal Music. Pick a topic. Brainstorm the topic. Start to weave together the basic parts of the song. Develop and formulate the lyrical poem. Consider finding a literary device(s) to add depth to the song. Develop the sound to go with the lyrics. Come back to the song, and revise as necessary. Black Sabbath set out to create Metal's counter-culture. They choose the topic of war. Black Sabbath then started to weave together these basic ideas into the song, "War Pigs". Black Sabbath began to formulate these basic parts of the song together. Literary devices were used to add depth to the song.
If you have ferns that are already growing in your garden, you likely won’t need to move them unless they’re showing signs of ill health. Ferns like lots of shade and moisture, and do well under the canopy of a few other larger plants or trees. Plant (or transplant) ferns onto a plot that gets northern sun and no direct sunlight. If ferns are left in an area with direct sunlight, their leaves will burn.  If it does not rain regularly in your area, you’ll need to water your ferns on a daily basis so that the soil is kept moist. Add a dense layer of pine needle or leaf mulch to the tops of your ferns; about 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) thick is ideal. This will help to lock in moisture and keep the rate of evaporation relatively low, so that the air near the ferns is a bit more humid.  Six months after the original planting, you can begin fertilizing the ferns for added growth. Select an organic fertilizer that is spray-on, and apply it to the ferns (following package directions). Additionally, you can add a layer of compost and mulch to the soil to create a better growing environment for the ferns. Do keep in mind that ferns have a lesser requirement of fertilizer than other common houseplants.  Ferns don’t have many natural predators outdoors, other than slugs and one or two rare diseases. If, however, you notice that your fern has damaged or diseased fronds, use a pair of gardening shears to cut them back. This will keep the integrity of the rest of the plant, and if it is a disease, prevent it from spreading to other plants.  Ferns can get quite large over time, and require splitting and transplanting. To divide a large fern into several smaller ferns, carefully dig out the plant and its roots. Carefully break apart the plant into sections; typically, the fern will grow in clumps making it easy to split. Then replant each of these, and water them well.	Plant ferns in the ideal location. Keep the soil moist. Fertilize the ferns once a month. Cut back damaged fronds. Transplant if necessary.
Not only should they be purchased from a reliable brand, but they should be the right tires for your vehicle type and the season. Check the vehicle user's manual for advice, and discuss your options with the retailer before purchasing.; , They should be free of imperfections, such as nicks, cuts or holes. If you see anything that you're not sure about, ask first.   If purchasing used or reconditioned tires, check even more thoroughly, especially for puncture signs. After purchase, do a regular check for cuts, holes, embedded stones, etc., at least every few days. The earlier you spot a problem, the easier it will be to fix the affected tire and keep it in good condition.  This may be costly but it is safer, as all the tires will have the same amount of tread and there will be less chance of uneven wear caused by leaving on existing tires.If you do choose to only replace two tires, is recommended that you place the new tires on the rear axle. This is because the new grip will give you better control in difficult driving conditions, as the rear wheels are not connected to the steering wheel.However, this may depend on your vehicle's requirements, so always check the user's manual for advice.  In addition, read the tire manufacturer's requirements. That way you will be aware of any unique requirements that are relevant to either your car or the tires you've purchased.  Balancing is an important way to prevent early demise of your tires; get the tires balanced each time that you purchase new ones; they should balance properly on the wheel mounts.   If a tire is unbalanced, it will cause uneven wear on the tire tread. It can also cause the car to vibrate and front end parts of the car may also wear out faster.  Do a monthly tire check when the tires are cold (at least three hours since driving). Check the tire pressure to see if it is at the point recommended by the vehicle user's manual. Tires that are under- or over-inflated will wear faster and won't perform as they should to maintain grip and keep you safe on the road. By maintaining the right pressure in your car's tires, you can help them to last longer.   Use a tire gauge to check the tires. These are available from auto supplies stores and hardware stores. The recommended tire pressure for your vehicle can usually be found in the vehicle user's handbook, on the car manufacturer's website, on a label inside the door or inside the gas tank flap. The inflation level shown on the tire refers to its maximum level of inflation, not the recommended tire pressure; don't confuse the two!  , At the same time that you do a monthly tire check, also check the tread for wear. Tread is related directly to grip and traction, so the more worn the tread is, the less grip it has. Worn tread on new tires is an indicator of a problem, and you should have the car checked by a mechanic to see what the problem might be and have it fixed quickly.  It should also be checked as quickly as possible after hitting the wheels on something. For example, if you bang the wheels into a curb or into a pothole, etc., they may go out of alignment. If this misalignment is not corrected, the tires will wear faster and this may compromise your steering and safety.   Wheel alignment checking should also occur after noticing irregular tread wear.  Rotation of the tires at the intervals advised by the manual can help preserve them for longer.  Do not regularly screech to a halt, storm off from the traffic lights or speed over the mandated limit. All of these actions cause additional wear and tear on your tires and reduce the longevity of your tires (not to mention wasting fuel).	Purchase good quality tires. Inspect the new tires before agreeing to buy them. Try to replace all four tires at once. Read the instructions related to tires in the vehicle user's manual. Ensure that the tire balance has been checked upon fitting the tires after purchase. Inspect the tire pressure regularly. Inspect the wear of the tire tread regularly. Check the wheel alignment yearly. Rotate the tires as advised in the vehicle user's manual. Drive with a view to maintaining sensible speeds and avoiding actions that might harm the tires.
Audacity is a free, open source software program available for download off their website. Follow the download instruction, then install Audacity. Once installed (a computer restart may be necessary) open Audacity and click File, then Open, or press Ctrl+O (Command-O on a Macintosh).; , Click Open. Two large, blue oscilloscope-like shapes will appear on the screen—one for the left channel (bottom) and one for the right (top).  Press pause, and then zoom in on that section.   Continue zooming and rewinding until you can place your cursor on the exact part of the blue line that begins the foul word.  Verify you have the right selection by clicking on the green Play arrow.  Click "Generate" on the popup window to complete the silence.  Tone—This selection will make a tone with a pitch that you can vary in the window which appears. This is a "television style" edit. Use the settings shown: If you're musically inclined, you can set the pitch of the beep to be the same as the key of the song. For example, if the song is in the key of A (major or minor), set frequency to 880Hz. Keep the Amplitude low to begin with, especially if you don't choose Sine wave—you can always undo and make it a bit louder if it's too soft. You can also click the Effect menu and select Wahwah, setting resonance to 6.0. This makes the voice make another traditional radio edit sound, while leaving the beat rather than silence, although it does not work for all curse words.  Take care so that the inserted section is the same number of samples as the deleted section, and if possible, make sure the waveforms line up at the beginning and the end.  If you inserted a tone, for example, you'll see what looks like a solid block:  , Rewind to a few seconds before the word, then press the play button to hear your effect. If it's not to your liking, simply undo, then try other methods till you find something acceptable. , Then, click the effects button again and at the top it will say Repeat Sliding Time Scale/Pitch Shift. Click that button two or three times more and for the f word it will make a sound like 'fuwwww' or for the b word 'bewwww'.	Obtain music editing software. Browse to the song file (.mp3, .wma, or .wav) you wish to edit. Press the play icon on the toolbar and listen to the song until you reach the part of the song with the vulgar word. With your cursor, click and drag in the waveform area to select the duration of the inappropriate word. Press the stop icon (the orange square), click on the Generate menu, and select one of the following options:    Silence—This selection will eliminate all sound from the selection, creating a traditional "radio edit.", Tip for the really musically-inclined: Take an instrumental section that matches the key and rhythm of the offending section, and replace the offending section with the instrumental bit. Note the change of the waveform display. Test your edit. Enjoy your music without the profanity.  , Alternatively select the curse word, press the effects tab at the top and go down to Sliding Time Scale/Pitch Shift and where it says Final Pitch Shift (Semitones): type in -12.000 and click okay.
Note: The suitability of the soil to grow grass often correlates with the suitability of the soil for a landing strip. Too much clay will produce a soupy mess when wet, for example.	Stability especially in poor weather.
This type of book club gathers a collection of books for its members to borrow. The more people you invite, the larger and more interesting your library. That said, for logistics reasons you may want to start with ten people or fewer.  There are two common ways this type of club can function:   Each member loans the club 1-3 books each meeting. Alternatively, each member donates a certain amount of money each meeting. The host for that month (a rotating position) spends the money to buy books for the club to enjoy.  Unless you have a communal space to store the books, the book club usually only borrows or returns books once every month or two. This is also a good chance to trade recommendations and socialize.   It's usually easiest to have one person store the book collection and host the meetings, so you don't have to transport the books. Consider putting out a donation box to reimburse this host for his time.  Here are a few suggested rules to keep the club running smoothly:   Each member can borrow one book at a time. Each book is due back after a certain amount of time (such as two months). Set a small fine for late books, to be put in a communal fund for snacks or similar expenses. Set a larger fine for lost or damaged books, to be given to the original owner of the book.  For space reasons, most clubs won't want to keep their collection growing endlessly. After a book has been around for a certain period of time (say 6 to 12 months), return it to its original owner or purchaser.  One person should be responsible for a document that lists every book in the collection, with the following information:   Who currently has the book (if anyone). When the book is due back in the collection. The original owner/purchaser. When the book is due to return to the original owner/purchaser.	Come up with a member list. Set rules for book acquisition. Decide where and when to meet. Write down the loan policy. Set a return schedule. Assign a member to track the loans.
In order to dye yarn in a slow cooker, you must choose the right type. You can only use undyed yarn made from protein-based fibers, such as wool or silk. The process won’t work on plant-based fibers, such as cotton, bamboo, or flax, or synthetic yarns, such as acrylic or nylon.You can use yarn that’s a blend of protein-based and other fibers as long as it’s at least 50 % protein-based. For example, you could use yarn that’s 75% wool and 25% nylon.; , To prepare the yarn for dyeing, you need to wrap the yarn in large loop that’s approximately 3 to 4 feet (0.91 to 1.2 m) (91 to 122 cm) long so it’s easier to work with. Wind it around the back of a chair to create the loop, and use a piece of synthetic yarn that won’t dye to loosely tie it so it’s secure.If you purchase yarn in a hank, or a big circle, you don’t need to tie it in a loop. A ball or skein of yarn must be tied in a loop, though. You may want to secure the loop of yarn in one more than one location to ensure that it stays wrapped up while you work with it.  Find a large bowl that’s big enough to hold the yarn. Pour 8 cups (1.89 l) of warm water into the bowl, and add ⅔ cup (158 ml) of white vinegar. Mix the solution with a wooden spoon to ensure that the water and vinegar are fully combined.The water doesn’t need to be hot. It should be between 95 and 105 degrees Fahrenheit (35 to 41 degrees Celsius).  Once you’ve mixed the water and vinegar, take the loop of yarn and place it in the mixture. Push it down into the water and hold it under until it is saturated enough to remain under the water on its own. Allow the yarn to soak for at least 30 minutes.Soaking the yarn in the vinegar mixture helps soften the fibers so the yarn will absorb the color more easily.  To ready the slow cooker for dyeing, plug it in. Turn the heat to high, so it can begin to heat up.For the best results, use a slow cooker that holds at least 6-quarts (5.7 l). If you are using a non-food coloring to dye your yarn, such as a fabric dye, you shouldn’t use the same slow cooker that you use for preparing food. You may want to buy a second slow cooker just for dyeing yarn at a thrift or discount store. You can add a liner to the interior of the slow cooker if you’re worried about the dye coloring it.  After you’ve turned the slow cooker on, pour enough water into it to fill it halfway. Allow the water to heat for 2 to 3 minutes, so it’s slightly warm when you add the coloring.There should be enough water in the slow cooker to cover the yarn completely. Start by filling it half way. If the yarn isn’t covered once you place it in the slow cooker, you can pour in more water.  When the water has had time to warm slightly, add food coloring in your chosen color to it. The amount of coloring you should add depends on how dark or bright you want the yarn’s color to be. Use a spoon to mix it into the water until it’s fully combined.For the best results, use synthetic food coloring. Vegetable-based food colorings typically don’t work as well. You can also use powdered food drink mix, such as Kool Aid, to dye the yarn. Fabric dye also works well to dye yarn, but it will leave you unable to use the slow cooker to make meals again in the future. It’s best to start with a small amount of coloring or dye. If you aren’t happy with the color of the yarn when it’s finished cooking, you can add more coloring and allow it cook longer. You can get an idea of how the color will turn out by sprinkling a few drops of the colored water on a piece of white paper towel. Create a custom shade for your yarn by mixing two or more food coloring colors.  After you’ve added the coloring to the water, lift the yarn out of the vinegar solution. Set it immediately in the slow cooker, making sure that it’s completely covered by the colored water.There’s no need to wring out the yarn after you take it out of the vinegar solution.  If the yarn isn’t completely covered with the color solution, add extra water to the slow cooker. That may mean you need to mix in additional coloring or dye as well., When the yarn is completely covered with the colored water, place the lid on the slow cooker. Allow the yarn to cook in the colored solution for 3 to 8 hours, or until the water becomes clear because all of the color has been absorbed.Don’t stir or move the yarn while it’s cooking. If you allow the yarn to cook in the slow cooker until the water is clear and it still isn’t as dark as you’d like, lift the yarn out of the water and add more coloring or dye. Mix it in to ensure that it’s fully combined, return the yarn to the slow cooker, and allow it to cook until the water is clear again.  When the yarn is the color that you want, lift it out of the slow cooker. Place it in a colander in the sink, and allow it to cool for at least 15 minutes.When you place the yarn in the colander, press down on it to release the excess liquid in the fibers.  When the yarn is cool enough to handle, turn on the water in your sink. Rinse the yarn under lukewarm water until the water runs clear., After the yarn is rinsed, place it on a dry towel. Wrap the towel around the yarn and press it to remove the extra moisture.It’s best to use an old towel because some dye may transfer from the yarn to the towel. You can also place the yarn in your washing machine on the spin cycle or spin it in a salad spinner to remove the excess moisture.  When the excess moisture is removed from the yarn, unwrap it from the loop and hang in a warm area of your home to dry. It may take as long as a day for the yarn to dry completely.When the yarn is dry, you can roll it back up in a ball or wrap it in another loop.	Choose a protein-based yarn. Tie the yarn in a loop. Combine some vinegar and water. Place the yarn in the vinegar mixture and let it sit. Heat the slow cooker. Fill the slow cooker half way with water. Mix the coloring into the water. Place the yarn in the colored water. Add more water to cover the yarn if necessary. Cover the slow cooker and cook the yarn for several hours. Transfer the yarn to a colander and cool it. Run the yarn under lukewarm water. Dry the yarn with a towel. Allow the yarn to air dry.
Locate your wire and cut it to the desired length. You don’t want too much slack, so try anywhere from 3 inches to a foot. This wire will connect the switch to the capacitor. You’ll also need to strip the wire from the rubber casing.  Solder the wire to one of the two terminals of the capacitor. Use a quality soldering gun to avoid a messy circuit board. Solder a blob of lead free rosin core to the surface. Then heat the wire to the blob with your soldering gun. It should dry shortly to create a firm connection.         , Take the wire you just soldered to the capacitor and attach it to the “off” side of the switch. You might need to solder the wire onto the switch, but most switches you buy have screwable ports for wires.  Wrap a strip of tape around your circular object with the adhesive side facing outward until it overlaps. Now take the enamel coated wire and wrap it 7-15 times. Leave some wire out to attach to the terminals. Don’t overlap any of the coil. Take time and be precise. Make sure the wire is snug and that there aren’t any spatial gaps.          Coat the finished wiring with tape so it’s secure. Slide the windings off the object. Cut the terminals of the coils to the desired length, but make sure you leave yourself enough room to work with., Using sandpaper, file down the tips of the wire to remove the enamel coat. This will create a stronger bond between the components.  Attach a strand of coil to the other terminal of the capacitor. Use care and don’t create a mess.          Solder onto the opposite side of the switch.  Connect one of the leads of the coil to the other “on” terminal of the switch., Make sure your battery for the device is charged and in place. Test the device on a handheld video game. Newer models might not work. Insert the electronic device into the circular coil and flip the switch.	Prepare your wire. Solder the wire. Attach to the switch. Prepare your coil. Remove the enameled coat. Solder the coil to the capacitor. Attach the coil to the switch. Fire when ready.
This means that if the words were , "She falls like the petal drifting from it's rose," you would gracefully sink to the floor and pretend to be the petal. Fluent is where you pour your heart and feelings out with your movements. Let's just say if you danced fluent to the rose petal line, you would probably feel sad because "she is drifting", so you would show that with a sad, but graceful, drift away from the center.; , It would get very boring to watch someone do the same movement over, and over, and over again.  The best places are the ones with a large lengthy mirror on the wall. , You should listen to it maybe 2-3 time to get the feel of the words, instruments, and the tempo.  This is a key part in getting better. You don't want to pull a muscle and not be able to practice, so be sure to stretch your arms, legs, neck, and maybe do some push-ups. If you plan on doing tricks, be sure to stretch extra well, so you won't get injured.  This sometimes is a hard concept for some people to understand. When you dance fluently, like the water in a stream, you let your body pretend you are trapped under the ocean. (Pretend you can still breathe) You would get bored just standing there with nothing to do, so you start to flow. Your limbs are floating, your heart lies on a cloud, your eyes are closed. You outstretch your fingers and open your mind to more fluent movement. You touch the sky with every reach and skim the ocean's sandy floor while the suns rays dance around you. This is how it feels to dance fluent. You move your arms and legs and head so they flow gracefully together.  To make your dance stand out, you may want to add tricks. There are hundreds of dance tutorials online. Chose a tutorial from an actual known dancer(so you can guarantee it's safe) and follow the teacher. Some examples of tricks are pirouettes, splits, barrel rolls, jumps, and leaps.	Understand that when you dance lyrical, your movements show the words of the song. Try to come up with lots of different feelings and moves. Find a stage, an open place, such as a basement, or even outside in your front lawn (if you do do this, make sure there is an outlet so you can plug in a CD player). Pick a song with deep meaning and flowing music, otherwise it gets a little harder to stay fluent with your movements.  , Listen to the song. Do your body a favor; before you dance, make sure you stretch. Just let your body flow. Learn tricks.
Otherwise, you can irritate it. What's more, you want to work with a clean palette.; , Give special emphasis to the area below your eye, nearest your nose. Smudge the eye pencil with a tissue wrapped around your finger for a smoother look. Be sure to let the edges of the "bruise" fade realistically.   Highlight immediately beneath your eye and the line that forms a crescent shape underneath your eye. These two areas get very puffy and inflamed when hit.  Highlight the edge of the nose that got hit (near the corner of the eye) and just below the eye, where the last knuckle would land.   A cream-based shadow may be more effective, but matte powder will work, too.  Use a stipple sponge, if you have it, to mimic a scrape. Concentrate the red on the corner of the eye near the tear duct and at the top of the cheekbone near the outer edge of the eye.  Dab the brush on your hand before applying to make sure you're not accidentally concentrating too much product on any one area.  Add these colors at the outer corner of your eye, your orbital bone, and the lower edge of the "bruise". When a bruise fades, it turns more to this end of the color spectrum.	Wash and dry your skin before you begin. Smear black eye pencil around your entire eye socket, including your eyelid. Apply a coat of matte, dark purple eyeshadow over the eye pencil. Apply some dark red eyeshadow or lipstick in small amounts. Add dark blue or dark maroon eyeshadow to the inner corner of the eye and along the eyelid. Finish by blending in yellow or light green.
You will need tempera paint, an old tray, washing-up liquid, a sponge, construction paper, and a container., Combine a cup of washing-up liquid and a few tablespoons of paint until properly mixed through using the drinking straw.,, Press the soup onto the paper using the sponge, until you have as many pretty bubble patterns and designs as desired. Use multiple colors for an extra vibrant piece of art., Hang it up and enjoy!	Gather your supplies. Mix the liquid and and paint.Lay the watercolor paper on the old tray. Make the bubble art. Allow your piece of art to dry.
The battery should be located in an accessible part on either side of the car's frame. The battery is a rectangular box with two cables attached to it. Some European cars (some BMW's) have the battery under the matting in the trunk, some vehicles can have the battery located under the rear seat, or some are located inside the fender of the wheel well (some Chrysler's). The latter is often very difficult to remove.  Locate the positive and the negative terminals of the old car battery. The positive terminal will have a plus sign (and is often red) and the negative terminal will have a minus sign (and is often black).  Loosen the negative cable clamp with a wrench (Usually 8mm or 10mm) and slide it off of the terminal. If the cables are unmarked, label them so that they don't get mixed up (otherwise you may ruin your car's electric system later on). It is also important that you disconnect the negative terminal socket before the positive terminal socket. Otherwise, you may short circuit the positive terminal to a grounded part of the car. , Unfasten the battery holder and remove any screws, clamps or bars holding the battery in place. Carefully lift the battery out of the car. Remember that a battery can weigh 30 to 60 pounds, or 13.5 to 27 kilos, so if you have any back problems, get a helping hand.	Locate the battery. Identify battery terminals. Disconnect the negative terminal. Disconnect the positive terminal.  , Remove the car battery.
Go out to watch at midnight or later. The pre-dawn hours are usually the best for viewing because the side of the Earth facing the sun allows more meteors to be visible., Mittens or gloves and a warm hat are also a good idea for those who feel the cold at night.   Bring a reclining chair if you don't fancy lying on the ground or holding your head tilted back all night.  Planning a camping trip at this time is a great option.  If you are unsure of your orientation, use your compass or an app to get your bearings and determine which direction is northeast.  The meteors can be seen using the naked eye.  For closer views, use binoculars or a camera with a telescopic lens. You don't have to use these to appreciate the meteors, however, and these can limit your field of vision, causing you to miss the ongoing show if you don't know where to look.  The stars of Perseus form somewhat of a "Y" or "V" shape and the meteors will seem to shoot outwards from a central point in this constellation. They will be visible, however, all over the sky.   Perseus can be found by following the bottom left star in Cassiopeia (the W constellation) down and to the left. There is a double cluster that appears the meteor shower is coming from.  The tripod is important to provide stability during long exposures and limit the camera movement when you take the photos.   Put the camera focus on "infinity" and use an open shutter over a period of minutes if your camera has this capability. Read wikiHow's article on photographing the night sky for more information.	Set your alarm clock. Pack a blanket, compass, bug spray, and snacks. Find a spot away from city lights. Look towards the northeastern sky. View the sky with your unaided vision. Look for the constellation Perseus. Bring along a tripod if you want to take photographs.
Most of the materials mentioned in the things you'll need section can be procured at online shopping sites or hardware retail shops. Some, such as the laser diode, can be found in other electronic devices such as a disk burner.; , Many countries have laws governing the use and power of laser pointers. You can even be prosecuted for having a laser pointer which exceeds the permissible power limit. Be sure to keep the law in mind and tone down your laser pointer as and when necessary.  You will need to drill two holes in the casing. Drill one on the top of the casing. This will be the switch. Drill another hole on the side of the casing for the laser.  Some casings come with laser diodes built in. If your casing comes with a built in laser diode, check whether it is powerful enough for your needs. If it isn't, gently remove the laser diode and replace it with a new one.  Any battery pack will do, as long as it is powerful enough.  You can solder pins on the laser diode to make the attachment easier.  Add a switch, and solder all the components to the casing.  Check whether it works. If it doesn't , you may need to replace the power source or check whether all the components are attached correctly.	Gather your materials. Keep the law in mind. Drill the holes. Insert the laser diode into the casing. Add a power source to your laser. Attach the power source to the laser diode. Put on the finishing touches. Test your laser pointer.
Quantities for each ingredient will vary, dependent on the size and amount of candles you plan to make. However, half a pound of wax equals to 10-12 small candles, and candles only require one wick each. You should check your mould tray for a point of reference if you're unsure about quantity.          Paraffin wax.Half a pound of wax should serve you well for a home set of candles. If you're feeling thrifty however, you can melt down old candles into fresh wax. Drops of essential oil. These are essential, and can be used if you want to give your candles a scent. Only a couple of drops per candle will be needed to get the scent. Baking tray mould. The size of your mould will determine how large the candles will be. Small muffin candles will burn for approximately one hour. Large muffin tray candles will go on for about three.Tart moulds and cookie cutters can be used as well for this, so long as there's a moulded slot for a candle to settle in. Pretabbed candle wicks. Making sure to get pretabbed wicks can take some of the hassle out of adding them into the wax. Dye chips.Dye chips are specifically made for use in homemade candles. They're small, but effective, so you'll probably only need around one per candle. You can eyeball the effects of the dye chips as you add them.; , If you're using a double boiler, bring the outside water to a boil first before adding the wax. A double boiler is prepared by filling a larger pot with water to boil, and setting a smaller pot in the middle. The boiling water on the outside will heat up whatever's inside the smaller pot.         Do not apply direct heat to candle wax. It can catch fire if you do. An empty coffee can will suffice for heating candle wax if you don't have an extra pot or pitcher to place in your double boiler.A small coffee can is a good alternative for someone who doesn't have a pot large enough to make a double boiler.  One dye chip per pound of wax should be enough to ensure a bold colour. It's important to add your dye while the candles are heated. That way, they'll be able to disperse throughout the wax with stirring. Dye chips are designed specifically for use in DIY candle-making, so they tend to mix with wax very well.         Mix it in with a wooden spoon to ensure the dye is consistent in the candles. Essential oils are added for the sake of scent, and should be added to the pot as soon as you've turned off the heat.  Paraffin wax needs to be 150 degrees Fahrenheit in order to be ready for pouring.If you have a thermometer at hand, place it in the wax and gauge the temperature. Check the consistency periodically. You can do this by placing a wooden spoon in the boiler pitcher and gently stirring the wax around.          If you don't have a thermometer, wait until a thin film forms around the edges of your pitcher., Because you'll ultimately be taking them up held by their fragile wick, you'll want to minimize that resistance early on.          Excessive spray isn't necessary. Just make sure the bottom of each mould slot is evenly sprayed. Being thorough at this stage prevents hassle later down the road.  Pour it into each of the holes in your mould, and try to get the wax as evenly distributed as possible. If you don't have enough, you should be able to eyeball how much more you'll need to heat to finish the job.          Pour slowly and steadily. The wax will be hot, and pouring it quickly could risk injuring yourself. Cookie cutters are a great alternative. You'll be able to make interesting shapes out of your candle wax.To make a cookie cutter into a mould, run masking tape along the edge and bend the cutter so it can rest firmly on a sheet of aluminum foil. This will be a good makeshift foundation for the candles to rest upon. Muffin tray are the most common choice for homemade candle moulds. However, you can use just about any type of mould your kitchen has to offer, so long as the slots are small enough to make working floating candles.  Give the heated wax a few minutes to settle and cool. From there, you should be able to add wicks with the hopes they'll stand up in the wax. Tabbed wicks are generally easier to add because the tab helps to guide and secure the wick in place.          You can use a toothpick or bamboo skewer to fix the wick after adding it if it falls., Once the wicks have set, candles take up to two hours to harden completely.Set them aside, and occupy your time with something else while they settle.  Once your candle have been given enough time to settle, pull them up gently using the wicks. Use a piece of paper towel to wipe off any extra gunk away from the candles once they've removed and ready to set.         If you try to take out the candles too soon, they'll become harder to remove. If you've made this mistake and want to fix it, put them in the freezer for a few minutes, then take them out and try again., You should aim for one with a wide base to ensure the most room for candles. Glass orbs with a to-the-side opening are a great choice with floating candles, as the surrounding glass helps intensify the flame light.  You can get this impression further across by decorating the base of the vase. Adding sand to the bottom will give the vase an aquatic vibe. Using decorative gems will give your vase fantasy-based atmosphere.          Clear and coloured stones are both welcome additions to the base of the vase as well.It's best to keep your base to a single type of decoration. Otherwise, it will look messy and hurt the atmosphere. Shake the pot gently around to get the stones evenly across the base. Make sure you add the stones before the water to avoid making a mess when you spread the foundation.  For the maximum effect, you should fill your vase between 50-75% with water. Add your stones or other base decorations to the vase before filing with water. This will eliminate the risk of splashing, and make it easier to even out the stones across the base.  Place the unlit candles gently in the pot holding the wick. Don't try to put them in holding the wax, as you'll risk capsizing them in the water. Continue to add the candles until the pot begins to look crowded. Try not to overcrowd the pot, as this will hurt the peaceful aesthetic you're trying to create.  If your pot as a wide opening and there aren't a lot of candles, you can light them with a regular pocket lighter. In most cases however, a trigger-operated firestarter is preferable. With a firestarter, you can stick the fire nozzle into the pot without the risk of burning your hand in the process.	Gather your ingredients.Ingredients for candles may be purchased at arts and crafts store. Place wax in a double-boiler and heat to 185 degrees.A double boiler or hot plate will suffice while heating your wax. Introduce dye chips while heating.Dye chips will give your candles a pleasant colour. Heat the wax. Coat your tray with cooking spray.If you don't coat your mould with cooking spray or petroleum jelly before hand, your candles will put up a hassle when you try to take them out. Pour your wax into the tray slots.Once the heat is off, pick up the pitcher with wax. Add the wick. Allow the candles time to harden. Remove candles from tray. Pick a pot or vase.You can use any sort of pot or vase, so long as its clear. Add decorative gems or sand to the vase bottom.Floating candles are all about creating an ethereal atmosphere. Add water to the vase. Place candles in the vase. Light your candles.
Run a couple gallons of lukewarm water into a sink or bucket. Since you’ll be working with bleach, you’ll need a higher concentration of water than you would when cleaning with vinegar. Make sure there’s nothing in your work area that might be damaged by spilled bleach.   Bleach will need to be used to clean humidifier filters with extensive mold or mildewing.Avoid using hot water, as steam can cause the release of bleach fumes., You’ll only need to use about a teaspoon of bleach for every gallon of water. This will sufficiently dilute the bleach so that it can be used as an effective yet non-harmful cleaning agent. Be careful not to overdo it—too much bleach may eat right through a plastic filter.When handling bleach, always wear gloves and work in a well-ventilated area. If possible, equip a respirator and eye protection.Avoid coming into contact with the bleach solution with bare skin.  Dunk the dirty filter into the solution and make sure it’s fully submerged. Bleach has potent cleaning and sterilizing properties, so no scrubbing is necessary. After a short soak, your humidifier filter will look as good as new.If there’s any mold, mildew or mineral deposits remaining after the initial soak, mix up a fresh batch of solution and soak the filter for another 10 minutes., Carefully remove the now-clean filter from the bleach solution and rinse it under warm water. Turn the filter slowly and aim the stream so that it flows through the filter from every angle. This will ensure that it comes out free of both mold and bleach. Air dry the filter, then return it to the humidifier.You can also make sure the filter has been properly rinsed by swishing it through a sinkful of clean water. It’s important that you wash away every remaining trace of bleach, or it could be released into the air when you operate your humidifier again.	Fill a large container with water. Add a splash of bleach. Soak the filter in the diluted bleach for 10 minutes. Rinse and dry the filter.
Very often when you make a mixtape for a parent or other older relative, it is intended to be a way for them to sample new music. If you're going to show them a lot of new music, spend some time trying to guess whether or not they'll actually enjoy listening to any of it first. Remember, this person has very different musical tastes than you do.  For this kind of mixtape, pick the catchiest and most accessible songs you can think of within the confines of whatever type of music you're planning to give away.   Use your past as a guide. If you can't figure out which tracks those might be, think back to the first time you heard the albums in question. What tracks immediately caught your attention? Even if you've moved on from them now, those are the tracks most likely to make a good impression on people who haven't heard the music before.	Hear with the recipient's ears. Pick your tracks based on what you think they will like.
You don't need much, only a basket or two to hold them in and gloves so your hands don't get all juicy! I wouldn't recommend picking in rainy weather as the raspberries can get squashed and liquidy.; , If you go out just hoping to come across a patch of them then you are wrong! You have to plan ahead and find somewhere close to you. Otherwise, it's a wasted journey and a waste of petrol! However, if you have in your own garden, then pick away!  , Raspberries can be harvested all the way from mid-summer through to the first frost. The fruit is ripe when it can be easily be removed from the plant without being squashed. Fruit ripens at different times, so you will be able to harvest raspberries throughout the season. By autumn they have usually gone past it.See "Tips" for more information.  If you are picking black, golden or purple raspberries, look for berries with firm plumpness. If they are almost a neon red they are slightly passed their best so don't pick them.  Do not pick ones that have a hole in them as an insect has probably got there before you. , Raspberries do not store well and spoil quickly after being picked. Brambles and blackberries are picked in the same way so keep that in mind if you have a bush or two of them! Read how to store raspberries for advice on how to keep them fresh for up to 6 days.	Make sure you are prepared for the picking. Find your area you are going to pick in. Harvest at the right time. Select only the bright red berries. Find the best ones to pick. Hold carefully between the thumb and forefinger and pull: , Use quickly.
For this step, you'll need twelve pieces of wood that are cut to 240 mm and six pieces of wood cut to 248 mm, all about 1 inch wide and 1/4 inch for the height. Use a handsaw to cut the pieces.   Make sure that the width and height of all 18 pieces of wood are exactly the same. Try to purchase wood sticks that are already pre-cut to be 1 inch wide and 1/4 inch high. That way you'll only need to worry about cutting the length.; , You'll need to cut 12 pieces at 50 mm each, with the same other dimensions as the other pieces (1 inch wide and 1/4 inch high).  In order to removed the jagged edges left from cutting the wood, you'll need to lightly sand the edges with some sandpaper.  To achieve the beautiful two-tone look, you'll need to stain half of the pieces of wood (of all sizes). So, separate each size of the wood pieces into two sections and apply wood stain to one group.   Choose any wood stain color you like, as long as it contrasts with the existing wood color. Apply the stain generously and wipe off the excess with a paper towel or rag. You need to cover the surface area of both sides and the ends, but don't worry about getting all of the 1/4 inch side because these sides will be glued together. Let the stain dry completely (at least 4 hours) until you move on to the next step.  Take the six pieces of wood that were cut to 248 mm and line them up. Each side of the jewelry box will be made out of three of the six pieces.   Use wood glue to glue the pieces together lengthwise into two three-piece sections, making sure you alternate between the stained and unstained pieces to achieve the two-tone look. Wipe off any excess glue that leaks up between the cracks. Make sure the ends are lined up perfectly and then let the glue dry. You can clamp the pieces into place for a more secure, tight seal if you would like. To avoid gluing the wood to whatever surface you're working on, it might be helpful to lay down a piece of clear Saran wrap to work on.  Alternating between stained and unstained pieces, line up six of the 240 mm pieces of wood on the Saran wrap to make the base. Glue the pieces together, but instead of lining up the ends, alternate them by 1/4 inch (so that the end pieces will fit inside the gaps).  Line up the short end pieces that you cut (the 50 mm pieces), alternating stained and unstained pieces, on each end of the base. Each end will be six pieces long.   Because of how you off-set the edges of the base, one piece will sit on the table and be flush with the base, while the next piece will sit on top of the base, and so on.  Glue the sides of the jewelry box to the frame that you've made (out of the base and the ends). Let the frame dry fully before you move on.   You can use some pieces of wood cut to fit the inside of the box to help the frame maintain its shape while it's drying.  Apply a small coat of Vaseline to the off-set end pieces (the 50 mm pieces) to keep the lid from sticking to the frame with the excess glue when you glue it together.  Glue the remaining six 240 mm pieces of wood to each other in place on top of the frame. As before, make sure to alternate between stained and unstained pieces. The pieces will fit into the existing slots made by the alternating off-set end pieces.   Once all pieces are in place, you will have a perfect rectangular box.  To help the jewelry box dry in the right shape, clamp the box on two sides with two hand clamps. Once the glue is dry, your jewelry box is finished.	Measure and cut the wood for the top, bottom, and sides of the jewelry box. Measure and cut the wood for the ends of the jewelry box. Sand the cut edges. Stain the wood. Make the sides. Make the base. Make the ends. Attach the sides. Use Vaseline to keep the lid from sticking. Make the top lid. Clamp the box to dry.
As with germinating clematis’ from seeds, propagating clematis from cuttings requires quite a bit of preparation and the proper materials. You’ll need a very sharp knife or pair of gardening shears, horticultural disinfectant, 6-inch planters, disinfected potting mixture, fungicide mix, rooting hormone powder, plastic bags, and straws/stakes of some sort to create mini ‘greenhouses’. Begin by using your disinfectant to clean your knife/shears, planting pots, and the stakes/straws you are using.  Use your knife or gardening shears to make a single clean cut through an existing clematis plant. Cut a vine/branch that is at least 3-feet long, severing the plant just above a set of leaves and below the next node up on the stem. If you can, try to take your cutting from the center of the vine rather than the base or the tip, as this has the highest likelihood of sprouting. Continue to separate your cutting out into smaller sections for planting, by cutting just above a leaf node.  If you want your cuttings to sprout, it is imperative that you very carefully follow the directions for using your fungicide and rooting hormone mixtures. Start by dunking each of your cuttings in the fungicide mixture, following the directions that came with the mix. Then, dip the ends of each cutting in the rooting hormone mix, being careful to get just the right amount. Adding too much of the rooting hormones can prevent growth, which is not what you want. Finish by cutting one leaf off each stem; this will reduce moisture loss.  Fill each of your pots with your sterile soil mixture so that they are about ¾ of the way full. Bury the tips of each of the cuttings so that the joint of the leaves are level with the topsoil. Give them a light watering so the soil is damp, and label the pot if applicable.  Clematis cuttings will thrive in a slightly humid environment, which you can easily create with a few household materials. Stick 3-4 straight straws or bamboo stakes into each container, and place a plastic bag over the top. Make sure that the bag is not touching the plant at all, and give the soil a good watering. Once a day, flip the bag inside out to let excess moisture out and to prevent rotting.  It will take 6-8 weeks for your cuttings to start growing, and in the meantime they should be placed under the best growing conditions possible. Relocate the potted plants to a place that has plenty of ambient sunlight, but is mainly shaded, with a temperature between 60–70 °F (16–21 °C).   Too much direct sunlight can overheat the young plants, especially under their plastic bags.  Although your cuttings may sprout in 6-8 weeks, they likely won’t be ready to be planted outdoors for about a year. During this time, water them regularly so that the soil is kept moist at all times, and continue removing and replacing your plastic bag ‘greenhouse’ to keep the humidity up.	Prepare your supplies. Take your cutting. Carefully prepare your cuttings for planting. Plant your cuttings. Increase the humidity. Move the cuttings to the best location. Maintain your cuttings.
Before your kid gets behind the wheel, your teen will be watching you drive; even if you don't realize it. Once the child has an image in their head of how the parents drive they'll start to model the same behavior. So if you've got any bad habits like running red lights, rolling through stop signs, or speeding, this would be the time to stop. Most parents don't find their own bad habits stressful but find it drives them crazy their teen does the same thing. Once they start repeating your bad habits, and you ask them to stop, they're probably going to say "but mom/dad, you do it." So the easiest way to avoid this and stay sane is: just don't do them.; , Many people are "unconsciously competent" when they drive; they do it without thinking about it. But if you have no conscious idea of what you're doing behind the wheel, how are you going to explain it to your teen when they ask what they should do? When you're driving around, make little "mental notes" about when you start braking, how fast you're driving in different situations, and where you're looking. When you have an idea of when, where, and what you're doing on the road, it's easier to recognize mistakes that your teen makes as early as possible. Which gives you both more time to deal with the road ahead.  Driving with your kids is not going to be perfect all the time. Especially in the beginning things are going to be rocky. But there is hope. Research has shown that if we have as little as 10 seconds notice before something bad happens, we'll start to come up with coping strategies that make us feel less stressed out.{{fact} For example: if you're approaching a turn onto a side street, ask yourself "how could this go wrong?" Biggest problem in this type of situation is driving too fast, so you decide on an "if-then" scenario. "If" my kid is going over 20kph/12mph within a few moments of starting the turn, "then" I'll hold the wheel and tell them to keep driving straight. Practice mentally going through different "if-then" scenarios to feel ready for anything (and preserve your sanity) on the road.  Some people hate the idea of having these, but learn to LOVE that people know your kid is learning. It can put your mind at ease and help you stay calm when you know that other drivers will attribute mistakes to someone learning rather than being a bad driver. You can get your own signs made at many sign shops, order them online, tape a handwritten note in the back window or use a government issued "L" (learner) sign.	Pay Attention to Your Own Bad Habits. Be Aware of What You're Doing and How You're Doing It!, Get Emotionally Bulletproof for Your Kids Mistakes. Use Student Driver Signs.
Is it your average point-and-shoot pocket camera? If so, there's a chance it will be allowed inside. Check before taking measures to sneak it in.; , Most cameras now are going for a thin feel and look, and this works to your advantage. Fatter cameras are generally not as tall; use the dimensions to help you feel out places it can go.  It can be in a pocket, purse, concealed in clothing or strapped to your body. Here are a few methods.   Wear a large, baggy sweatshirt with nothing underneath (this is particularly effective if you are female).Use your camera's strap or strap from somewhere else to sling it over your shoulder. Secure it so it hangs right in the pit of your back where it curves in before your buttocks. Put your sweatshirt on over it. If the guards ask you to remove your sweatshirt, lift the front up a bit to show them that you can't, as you have nothing on underneath. Take your purse (or the purse of a female accompanying you, if you are male). Either cut out the lining on the bottom, or find material like it and cut a piece that fits. Lift it and place your camera in the bottom. Fill the remaining space with soft material, both to protect your camera and solidify the bottom again. Replace the lining. Throw some tampons on top. Most bouncers will not dig around very thoroughly. Wear a somewhat baggy long sleeve shirt. If your camera is small enough, strap it with some tape or a strap to your underarm. Be warned, if you are going to an establishment with a gun threat, you are likely to be frisked and this is easily found through touch. Crotch it. Similar to the underarm technique, wear baggy pants and strap it to your inner thigh, very close to your private area. There's a very good chance you won't be searched thoroughly here. If you are a female, wear a mid-length fluffy skirt. Not only will you not be touched there, a skirt looks open enough to allay suspicion, though it conceals very well. You can also unbutton your pants, hang your camera from your button, and then re-button your pants. Then simply slip the camera down into your pants and let it hang. It may be uncomfortable,but holds your camera securely and you don't have to worry about it being found, even if you're frisked. If you have a small and thin wallet, empty most of your wallet and tape it to the inside of the wallet. Keep your wallet in a large pocket and if frisked, when they ask what's in your pocket, immediately say its just your wallet. If you do this you should get in fine. If you're using a professional grade camera with a lens, this may work for you. You'll need a friend. Take your camera, a separate body you won't be shooting with, and two lenses. Have your friend conceal one lens well and one lens very conspicuously, so that it will be found with a simple search. Do the same with your two camera bodies. Have your friend go first. When the lens is found, have them give it up obligingly and apologize to you, where you will step up, possibly curse or look abashed, and hand over your dummy camera body. These will be tagged for pickup after the show, and it is unlikely they will search you for a second camera. The same can be done with small pocket cameras. Conceal your real one well, and then use a disposable or cheap other camera as your dummy. Ladies: Fluff and tease your hair up to a nice volume. Get a poofy sort of hat, like the ones Britney Spears is fond of. Pull some of your hair into a poof on top of your head, and conceal your camera inside. Top it off with your big hat and you're good to go. This is also easily reversed once inside, so you don't have to walk around with bad hair. Security may ask you to remove your hat though, counteracting this technique. Use your gloves. Get one pair of gloves, and a third of the same or a similar type. Place your camera inside one glove, and wear the other two. When in line, place your camera glove someplace inconspicuous but where you might set your gloves normally. When in plain sight of a bouncer, or right before being searched, obviously take your gloves off and place them on top of the third, then pick them up in one hand or set them on the table with your jacket and umbrella, or something of the sort. Then when you have been searched, pick up your gloves, tip your hat, and enjoy the show.  I doubt that the guard would ask you to take off your shoes. When in there, go into the bathroom and take the camera out of your shoe; put the camera in one of your pockets or any other easily-accessible area and enjoy the show.  Go through the whole process with the guard and get in. During the concert, play, show, etc. rip open the seam and take out the camera.  Be apologetic and act ignorant.  if the guard asks to see your bag give it to them most guards don't check in the hoodie. Put in some cash, a phone, etc. to make it look inconspicuous.	Examine your camera. Check its size. Find a place to put your camera. If your camera is strong and thin enough, put your camera in your shoe. Wear an old jacket and carve a little seam in it(make sure it's on the inside of the coat so nobody sees it), the size of a camera will do it and tape it up or sew it up. Once inside, if you get caught, do not make a fuss or a scene, your camera, film, memory card, and tickets may all be subject to confiscation. Take a cinch bag and a hoodie, wrap you camera into your hoodie and put the hoodie in you bag. Finished.
If you're using medical tape to keep gauze or other protective wrapping on your body, it helps to gently wet the edges of the tape to make it easier to remove. The water will help dampen the tape and make it easier for it to come off. Then, slowly pick at the tape while it's in the water until it eventually peels off.          Don't soak a serious wound in water to help get the tape off. It's usually important to keep wounds as dry as possible as you're trying to heal them, making it important that you only use a small amount of water to help ease off medical tape.  Gradual pulling makes it a lot more painful. Instead, dab it gently with water and pull it off as quickly as possible. One second of quick pain is better than ten seconds of wincing and whimpering while you carefully rip it. Plus, the soapy water should help to soften it and remove it much more quickly.  Carefully lift up a small piece of the tape, dabbing a cotton ball in a little Vaseline, then wiping a little under the lifted piece of tape to help soften the adhesive. Slowly lift up more of the tape using the cotton bud and more vaseline. Continue doing until all the tape is removed.  Medical tape will often leave some gunk stuck to your skin and your hairs, and the best way to remove it is by rubbing it vigorously with warm soapy water. Stay clear of the wound, if there is one, or leave the wound covered while you clean up the area affected by the tape.	Wet the edges of medical tape. Remove the tape quickly. If it's especially painful, use a small amount of Vaseline. Clean up the remaining residue.
Graduation caps have tassels that often come in a separate plastic bag from the gown and are not already on the mortarboard, which is the official name for the flat graduation cap.Shake the tassel in order to untangle any of its strands before you try to fasten it to the cap. This will make the process easier. The mortarboard earned its name because it was said to resemble tools used by masons to hold mortar. These graduation caps, including tassels, were first worn by artists and students in the 14th century and being able to wear one indicated intelligence and power.; , You can figure out the front of the cap by looking on the cap’s inside. There will be writing that says “front of cap.”   Graduation caps usually have a square, flat top. They sit on the top of a skull cap that should be form-fitting around your head. The tassel goes on top of the cap. Make sure you wear the cap correctly also. Mortarboard graduation caps should be worn so the cap’s front tip is centered on your forehead, right between your eyes. The hat shouldn’t be tilted off your head. Put it directly on your head’s top., Most tassels have two strings that form into a loop at the end to affix them to the button on the top of the graduation cap.Place the center of the loop end of the tassel over the button at the top of the cap with the tassel toward the front of the cap. To do so, you must bend the loop in half and start passing the tassel side of the loop through the loop end. This will create a hole which the button can be placed through and when the tassel is then pulled tight, it will be securely held on the cap's button by friction and gravity. Gently tug both sides of the loop under the button edge to lock it into place. Criss cross your loop under the button, and pull until you hear it snap.  This is probably not necessary, but some people want a little more security around their tassel.   You could use a drop of glue on the end of the tassel before fastening it to the button. You could also use adhesive tape for the same purpose. Basically, you are sliding the loop at the top of the tassel onto the button at the center of the top of your mortarboard. Tug gently on the tassel to make sure it's firmly seated under the button. The glue or adhesive is just extra support.  Once, you are declared a graduate, flip it to the left side. Flipping the tassel is called “turning the tassel.”   If you want to keep the tassel as a treasure before you toss your cap, you can quickly remove it and tuck it in your pocket for safe keeping and pictures later. Don’t flip your tassel until you actually are handed your diploma on the commencement stage. Although the mortarboard is very old, turning the tassel is a tradition that only dates back about 40 years.  The rules are different if you’re not an undergraduate or high school student.   If you are getting a graduate degree (like a master’s degree or PHD), you will want to wear your tassel on the left side throughout the graduation ceremonies. Fastening the tassel works the same way no matter what the degree level, though.  You will need a button on the top of the hat so that you have something to loop the tassel around.   Fasten the tassel as you would do to a graduation hat, by looping the tassel around the hat’s button and securing it by criss crossing it around the button. You could fasten the tassel to the button by using a slipknot. To make a slipknot, hold the yarn with two hands. Create a loop by bring the yarn in your right hand under the yarn in the left hand, so the bottom of the yarn crosses. Secure the yarn at the crossing point. Reach through the loop, and grab the yarn on the left side. Pull the right hand back through with the yarn. Grab the two hanging ends and the loop, and pull them in opposite directions.  Sometimes people want to put a yarn tassel on a crocheted hat (or other piece of knitted work like a shawl).   Make the tassel separately, rather than crocheting it directly into the hat. You will want to attach the tassel to the hat after you finish the hat. Cut a piece of cardboard that is the width of the tassel length you want. You may need a different size of cardboard if you are working off a pattern. In such a case, follow the directions.  Take yarn, and wrap it around the cardboard. The more you wrap it, the fuller the ultimate tassel will become. You could also wind the yarn around something else, like a videogame or CD jacket. Wind it around loosely. Now, take a separate piece of yarn, and use it to tie the yarn bundle together at one end. You want this piece to be at least 6 inches long because you will also need it to tie the tassel to the hat. Slide the yarn carefully off the cardboard. You want a loop at the end of the yarn. Take another piece of yarn, and tie it around the bundle of yarn below the already tied end. Knot it.  You want to cut the loops off on the opposite end of the bundle that is tied, and trim the ends to make sure they are even.Now attach the tassel to the hat. You could use a crewel needle to stitch the tassel to the hat. Weave the end of the yard into the hat’s stitches. Thread one end end into the needle, and stitch the tassel and hat together. ,	Remove the tassel from its packaging. Locate the front of the graduation cap. Find the loop end of the tassel. Use a glue gun or other adhesive to better secure the tassel. Put the tassel on the right side of the cap until you graduate if you’re an undergraduate. Wear the tassel on the left if you’re getting a graduate degree. Secure a button to the hat. Put a tassel on a crocheted hat. Complete the yarn tassel. Cut the loops at one end of the tassel. Finished.
Waldo is a cottage industry of his own. In addition to puzzles and the books, you can find online Waldo riddles and games.It works the same way; you are given a complicated photo that includes a sea of people and you're tasked with spotting Waldo. Sometimes you will be given a multiple sentence riddle containing clues as to his location. Waldo is often harder to spot because the illustrator uses colors to fool you. For example, don’t assume he’s in the seas of red you see.  There are Waldo apps you can download on the Android and iOS smartphones. The newest apps are free.The plot involves a twister that has torn through the countryside, and you must locate Waldo and other hidden objects that the twister has scattered about, or they will be lost in the sea. Unusual stories accompany each new land. You will use a map to visit each of the lands, and will earn coins as you find the objects in them. The coins are used to unlock new lands. The game is called Waldo & Friends. One downside of it is that it contains ads. The positive is that if you are done with all of the Waldo books, there are plenty of other places you can find Waldo!  , You can increase your chances of finding Waldo in the app with a few quick strategies.Try playing the same scene again and again so you figure out where objects are placed, and you will be able to find them when you play again. When you find an object, don’t tap it right away. If you find more objects nearby and tap them to get combos, you will end up with a higher final score. Save bones for really tough scenarios because you can use them to instantly find an item. Wait until the final star of the game because they’re hard to get.  Look for the colors that stand out in Waldo's clothes, or look for the hat. These items will either be differently colored from the surrounding scenery or will stand out as something out of context.   Watch out for Waldo lookalikes! Often, there will be Waldo impostors in red-and-white striped shirts or glasses, there to trick you into thinking you've found Waldo. Be sure to look closely at the image you find to make sure it's the true Waldo. Look for "extras." Often, scanning for the bonus items on each page, you'll uncover Waldo along the way! It's a two-for-one that can save many valuable minutes in your day.	Look online. Download a Waldo app. Use tricks to find Waldo in the app. Look at the scenery in which Waldo appears.
If possible, use thread that matches the color of your clothing. If the stitch won't be visible from outside the garment, then the color of the thread does not matter. You may also choose to use a vibrantly-colored thread to complement or contrast with the fabric.; , If the fabric is thick and tough (denim, leather, and multi-layered cloth), use a sharp, heavy needle so that you can pierce the cloth without too much effort. If the fabric is soft or thin, you may use any needle – though you might want to use a more delicate needle.Cotton, nylon, silk, jute, mixed fabric, and any other thin, soft fabric is better stitched with a lighter needles. The needle can be as short as 1-2 inches, or longer as needed. If you use a thick needle—approximately 1 mm in thickness—it may leave visible holes in the fabric. You may use a finger cap to prevent being poked by the needle while stitching. Opt for a thicker needle to avoid breaking any needles. Use a solid board to push the needle through while stitching if your finger hurts. Some thick fabrics like denim need pushing against a hard surface.  If unsure, try laying the thread over the torn area for reference. Take about 10 inches more than you think you'll need. The in-and-out sewing motion will take up a lot of thread, and you'll also need a bit more thread than the needle's length in order to tie the final knot. Remember: the thicker the fabric, the more thread you'll need. You may choose to take two times more thread if the fabric is thicker than 5mm.  Make sure that the tip of the thread is tight, not split. If the tip is frayed: wet it, then roll it with your fingers so that it goes easily through the eye of the needle.Try using a needle threader if you have trouble., Hold both ends of the thread. Tie a small knot to keep the far tip (the one that you didn't thread through the eye of the needle) from slipping through the fabric after the needle.   If you intend to make a stitch to a torn knit wear, then you must make a bigger effort. Knit wear or woolen clothes contain much bigger gaps than other fabrics. Here, to begin with, you must make a knot with the threaded needle so that your thread has something holding it in place.	Get a thread roll and a needle. Pick the right needle for the cloth. Make sure that you have enough thread. Thread the needle. Knot the thread.
You will need a good pair of rose gloves and a pair of sharpened bypass pruners.   Rose gloves need to be thick and tall to protect your hands and arms from any thorns growing on the bushes. Bypass pruners cut like scissors do, making them preferable to anvil-type pruners, which have a tendency to crush the stems as they cut. Nice, clean cuts are essential to maintaining the health of the plant. You should also make sure that the pruners are very sharp. Sharp pruners will make cleaner cuts than dull pruners. If you do not have bypass pruners, you could use hedge clippers or trimmers, instead. Whatever you use, though, make sure that the tool can create sharp, clean cuts. If cutting canes larger than 1/2 inch (1.27 cm) in diameter, use loppers instead of pruners.; , Regardless of the purpose, time of year, or type of cut you are making, the cut should be made roughly 1/4 inch (6.35 mm) above the leaf bud at an outward angle.   The slant should be away from the bud. Cutting any closer to the bud could shock it, but cutting any further from the bud will leave too much old stem, and the plant will be directing a lot of lost energy to stem that will no longer produce much.  As you prune your roses, you should periodically dip them into a cleaning solution to sanitize them, thereby limiting the risk of spreading disease. This should be done regardless of how much you are pruning and during which season.   A common, all-purpose household cleaner is thought to work best. Alternatively, a solution of 70% rubbing alcohol can be used, instead.	Gather the necessary tools. Cut at an angle. Dip pruners into disinfecting solution.
“Slow toilet” can mean one of two things. Either the bowl isn’t filling quickly, or it isn’t draining quickly. If you’re dealing with the latter, the drain is likely clogged. You’ll need to unclog the toilet. If the bowl isn’t filling quickly enough, you might only need to check the tank.  The tank is the upright portion of the toilet, where you find the flushing handle. Lay the tank cover on the floor carefully; the heavy porcelain can potentially damage your floors., The flapper is a piece of plastic or rubber which sits over the valve at the bottom of the tank. Unless your toilet isn’t flushing at all, there should be a chain connecting this to the trip lever, a small arm running from the flushing handle.The chain should have just enough slack for the flapper to rest over the valve, sealing it. But it should be tight enough to lift the flapper when the flushing handle is used.  Performing this adjustment is rather simple. The chain should run through a hole in the flushing handle. You can easily disconnect the chain, and place a different link through the hole to adjust the chain’s overall length. The chain should be left with about half an inch of slack.Adjusting the chain means you may come into contact with the water in the toilet’s tank. As long as you wash your hands afterwards, this is perfectly safe.	Find the source of the problem. Lift the tank cover. Check the chain connecting the flushing handle to the flapper. Adjust the chain if needed.
Locate sheet music for the fife online or at music stores. Use a fingering chart side by side with the sheet music to remember where to place your fingers for each note.   You may be able to adapt music for another wind instrument—like a flute, piccolo, or panpipe—to play for the fife. Ask music store staff or someone familiar with wind instruments for help with this.  If you can’t or don’t want to read sheet music, you can also learn new songs simply by listening to them and sounding out the notes on your fife through trial and error, one note at a time.   It will get easier to pick out notes once you have a better understanding of your instrument and practice picking up songs by ear. If you get stuck figuring out a note or section of notes, try moving on to a different part of the song., Take deep breaths and move slowly from note to note when you’re figuring out a song. It helps to stand up rather than sit down to play. Hold your head and shoulders up and your chest open to take big deep breaths.   It can be very difficult and awkward at first to move your fingers from note to note. Be patient. Break the music down into small parts (just a few notes at a time), then repeat the same part over and over until you can move your fingers easily to each note before moving onto the next part.  Look up a fife and drum corps in your area. Join one of these groups to team up with other fife players and drummers to learn new songs, get valuable input and experience, and play in parades or historical events.  If you want to find another group to play with, and especially if you’re interested in the rich military history of fife music, talk to war reenactors about playing the fife for their reenactments or other events.  Continue to play just for yourself and improve by learning more from a teacher, an instructional book, or watching videos and looking up music online.	Find sheet music. Play music by ear. Breathe and take it slow. Join a fife and drum corps. Check with war reenactor groups. Keep playing on your own.
In the case of a small pattern, the tacking or pinning may be dispensed with and instead, the two sheets held firmly pressed against the window pane with the left hand, whilst the right hand does the tracing. However, even then it is safer to pin, sticky tack or gum the four corners of the two sheets together. This is especially useful in case of interruption such as the telephone ringing, as it is difficult to fit them together again exactly.  The tracing may be done with a pencil, or, with a gel ink pen or water-colour paint., The process of tracing is easy enough, so long as the hand does not get tired. Depending on how complex and large the pattern, you will become tired, hence the reason why it is best to tack the pattern to the window to take rest periods., Use as required.	Tack or pin the piece of paper on which the copy is to be made onto the pattern.  Take your preferred tracing item.  Commence tracing.  Remove when completed.
Unwrap the curtains if they are still packaged. After that, you should wash your curtains on a cold water delicate cycle and then dry them with low heat or no heat on a gentle cycle. Beyond removing residue from your curtains, washing will also make stubborn wrinkles less difficult.If your curtains are especially dirty, as might be the case if you're swapping in old curtains that have been in storage, you may want to wash them in warm water, but only if the label recommends doing so. Generally, you should wash your curtains in cold water. This will help prevent fading and shrinkage in your curtain fabric. For best results, you should use detergent intended for delicate fabric. With curtains that have dark or prominent colors, you might also want to use detergent formulated to keep colors from fading.If care instructions are included with your curtains, keep these. Some kinds of fabric or styles of curtain may require special treatment. If yours do, this information will be included in the care instructions. If there aren’t care instructions on the packaging or a separate sheet of paper, look for a small tag on your curtain. This should have information like the material your curtains are made of and recommended washing and ironing procedure.; , Much like you've laid your curtains out close to where you intend to hang them, you'll also want your ironing board set up close to the hanging location. This will create less opportunity for wrinkles to form while transporting your curtains between the ironing and hanging location.   If you're having trouble setting up your ironing board, look for a catch or button underneath the board. Many boards have this feature to prevent the legs from extending while you are moving it. You may find it easiest to set up your ironing board in its tallest position to make transferring your curtains from the board to the curtain rod easier., Depending on the age and brand of iron you're using, the time it take to heat up can vary. In many cases, five minutes should be sufficient for your iron to heat up.Then turn your iron’s dial to the appropriate fabric setting.   Most irons have a dial with which you can select a setting for the kind of fabric you'll be ironing. Common fabrics that are likely listed on your iron include cotton, linen, and synthetic fabrics. Check the tag on your curtain or its care instructions to determine the fabric you'll be ironing, and set your iron to that fabric.Never lay your iron so the metal, heated part of the iron rests on your ironing board. This can cause your iron to burn the board.  A little spritz of water to dampen the curtains will help your iron work its magic. Regular water from your faucet should work fine for this purpose, but if you have hard water, you may want to use distilled water to prevent discoloration in your curtains from mineral buildup.Feel free to use the spray feature on irons that have one in place of a spray bottle. However, a spray bottle will come in handy if you have to spot treat wrinkles that form after you iron.  There are many ways you can lay out your curtain, and you may find that some work better for you than others. To prevent missing wrinkles and make hanging the curtain easier on yourself, you may want to work from the top of the curtain down.   You can identify the top of the curtain easily by looking for the curtain rod loops or pockets. When ironing from one end to another, you'll likely need to reposition your curtains several times throughout the process.  If your iron doesn't have a stream or spray feature, take your water bottle and spray the curtain with clean water a few times until it is damp. Pass your iron back and forth over the width of the curtain until wrinkles are smoothed and work your way toward its bottom.It's unlikely you'll be able to iron your entire curtain on your board all at once. As you work farther down the curtain, you can adjust your curtain so that the already ironed top portion hangs off the end of your ironing board. Continue until the ironed portion almost reaches the floor. It's very common for a curtain to wrinkle after ironing. By allowing your ironed curtain to hang loosely off the edge of your ironing board until it almost reaches the floor, it's unlikely bunching or re-wrinkling will occur., Roughly one half to two-thirds of your curtain should be ironed at this point. By hanging the ironed portion of your curtain now, there'll be less of a chance it will wrinkle and you'll still be able to finish the un-ironed part. To do this you should:   Disassemble your curtain rod. Feed the rod through the tabs, pockets, or hanging loops at the top of the curtain. Hang the curtain and rod in place. The remaining un-ironed part of your curtain should hang low enough for you to finish the ironing. If you have a low ironing board, it may be difficult to iron enough curtain to allow the un-ironed remainder to reach your board after hanging so you can finish ironing it. In this case, you may want to bring a stool or something you can drape the ironed part of your curtain over to keep it from wrinkling while finishing the entire curtain. Then you can hang it., As you continue to iron your way toward the bottom of the curtain, you can allow ironed parts to fall into position to hang with the upper ironed portion. Try to avoid sharp angles that causes the fabric to fold or bunch. This could re-wrinkle your curtains.After you've finished, you can spot treat remaining wrinkles. You can do this easily with your spray bottle. Simply spray any remaining wrinkles with water, smooth the fabric with your hands, and let it dry. This technique works well for removing light wrinkles., Delicate, embellished fabrics can be damaged from the heat of your iron. However, for most unembellished curtains, you shouldn't need to do anything special to iron out wrinkles.   To protect delicate fabrics and embellishments, you can overlay a pillowcase or sheet over the embellished area you'll be ironing to protect it from direct heat, and then iron as normal. If you're concerned that the heat setting for your iron may be too high, a pillowcase/sheet buffer is also a good idea., Many curtains will not require starch, though easily wrinkled delicate fabrics may call for it. Starch will make your fabric crisp and less wrinkle prone. Your curtain instructions should indicate if a starch solution should be used on your curtains.Many modern forms of starch come premixed in a spray can. For this kind of starch product, you should follow the directions as indicated on its label. Some starch comes in powdered form and is intended to be mixed with clean water in a spray bottle. You can make your own starch spray with one heaping tablespoon of corn starch and one pint of clean water. Mix the solution well before using., With especially delicate or expensive curtains, your pillowcase/sheet heat buffer might not be enough to fully protect your curtains. You can still iron your curtains safely by using your pad and ironing the back of the curtain rather than the front., These kind of fabrics are especially prone to heat damage. When ironing these, you'll be sure to want buffer fabric, like a pillowcase or sheet, in between the iron and the curtain fabric. For extreme wrinkles, spray the curtain fabric with water first, put your buffer fabric in place, and then iron.  Gather pleats together and iron them down in a way that follows the design of the fabric. This will make the accent of the pleat look crisper and more sharply defined.   A spritz of water from your spray bottle can help your iron remove stubborn wrinkles in the pleating.	Wash the curtains. Set up your ironing board. Set up your iron. Prepare your spray bottle. Lay out your first curtain segment on your ironing board. Iron across the width. Hang your segment of curtain. Finish the curtains. Evaluate your curtain fabric. Use starch when recommended. Iron the back of the curtain for further heat protection. Take extra care with silk or satin curtains. Iron pleats to make them more pronounced.
Use windshield cleaner to clean the inside and outside of your windshield at least once a month. If you know you are about to drive for a lengthy period at night, make sure to clean your windshield beforehand as well.Alternatively, you can use a mixture of water, dishwashing detergent and vinegar to clean your windshield. Mix six cups (1,400 ml) of water, a tablespoon (30 ml) of detergent and a cup (240 ml) of vinegar together until well-combined. Fill a spray bottle with the mixture and use a clean microfiber cloth to wipe your windshield clean.; , Clean your side mirrors and windows once a month, or as they become dirty. You can use the detergent-vinegar solution to clean these as well. Spray the solution onto a microfiber cloth. Wipe the inside and outside of your windows clean, as well as the surfaces of your outside mirrors.To avoid streaks, make sure to dry your windows and side mirrors with a clean microfiber cloth afterwards.  You can use toothpaste to do this. Wet your headlights with a damp cloth. Apply a tablespoon (30 ml) of toothpaste to each headlight. Using the damp cloth, scrub the toothpaste over the entire surface. Scrub for one minute, focusing on dirty areas. Then rinse the headlights with water and dry them with a clean microfiber cloth.If the toothpaste method does not work, then you may need to get your headlights professionally buffed and cleaned.	Clean your windshield. Make sure your mirrors and windows are clean. Clean your headlights.
Before you can do a thorough job of cleaning out the vehicle’s interior, you’ll need to remove any loose trash from the cabin. If you have personal items like blankets, spare pairs of shoes or the like, you should remove them as well.Use a trash bag to collect scraps, loose wrappers, or any other trash from the floor, seats or ashtrays in the vehicle. Collect your personal items and set them aside to bring inside. Don’t forget to clean any trash or personal items out of the trunk as well.; , Either use a shop vacuum with a long hose or take your vehicle to an automotive vacuum center. Be sure to vacuum all of the carpeted surfaces in the vehicle, including the trunk and beneath the seats.If you take your vehicle to an automotive vacuum center (usually located with car washes) you will likely need quarters to pay for the vacuum. Keep an eye out for stains in the carpet you’ll need to address as you vacuum.  Use an automotive interior cleaner to wipe down all plastic trim components in the interior of your vehicle. If you don’t have automotive cleaner, an all purpose cleaner will also suffice for wiping away dust or any stuck on grime.Don’t use all purpose or interior cleaner on leather. Make sure to wipe in the nooks and crannies of the dashboard where dust tends to collect. You can purchase interior cleaners at most automotive and large retail stores.  Use a cleaner designed specifically for use on leather when cleaning leather seats or upholstery inserts. This will prolong the life of the leather and prevent it from cracking.They make spray-on leather cleaner as well as pre-moistened wipes you can use to simply wipe the seats and trip components down. If you wish, you may also use a leather treater after cleaning the leather. This will condition the leather deeper and help it maintain its softness and shine longer.  Use a glass cleaner to spray and wipe down all of the glass surfaces on the interior of the vehicle, including the inside of the windshield and the rear view mirror. Pay close attention to wipe away any streaks or fingerprints.You should wash the exterior of the windows with glass cleaner after washing the car to ensure there are no water spots.  If there are any stains in the seats or carpets that need to be addressed you can use either a spot-stain remover or a small carpet shampooer. Prior to using a stain remover on the stain, test it in an inconspicuous area to ensure the stain remover will not negatively affect the dye in the material.After you’ve tested your stain removal method, scrub it into any stains on the carpet or seats. Follow the directions for how long to leave it on the stain and how to properly wipe it away to remove the stain completely.  Engine degreaser works best on a warm application. Start the vehicle and allow it to run for a few minutes to bring up the temperature of the engine block and other components. This will make removing stuck on grime significantly easier.Don’t leave the engine running for too long or it may get too hot to touch.  Use a hand or socket wrench of the appropriate size to loosen the nut holding the negative cable onto the battery terminal. Slide the cable off and tuck it down to the side of the battery. Then use some plastic bags and tape to cover the battery and any other loose bits of wiring you see in the engine compartment.While the engine likely won’t suffer any issues from getting wet, it’s better to protect electronics that could feasibly arc when reconnected. If there are any aftermarket wires in your engine bay for things like external amplifiers or subwoofers, make sure they are covered.  Spray the engine degreaser directly onto the metal portions of the engine and cylinder head. If some of it over-sprays onto plastic components that’s all right, but try to avoid getting it on painted surfaces as it may damage paint.Read the instructions on the specific type of engine degreaser you purchased to know how long to let it sit. The longer you let the degreaser set (within reason) the deeper it will clean.  Use a stiff bristled brush to scrub large deposits of stuck on dirt or grime in your engine while the degreaser works. It should loosen the grime, allowing you to remove it with the brush. Be extremely careful not to burn yourself or breath the fumes in too deeply.It’s best to use engine degreaser in open, well ventilated areas. Remember that the engine is hot, so avoid touching it directly with your hands.  Use a hose to rinse the engine degreaser and all of the grime off of the engine. After you finish rinsing it, look around for areas that you may need to apply degreaser to again. Repeat the process if necessary.If certain parts of the engine are still dirty, apply the degreaser again and repeat the process. Plastic that still looks dirty can be cleaned with an all-purpose cleaner.  Before washing the body of the car, apply tire and wheel cleaners to your tires and rims. You may choose to buy a combination tire and wheel cleaner to minimize the steps, or you may choose to purchase cleaners for each portion of the wheel. Allow the cleaner to set for a while and scrub away brake dust or stuck on grime with a soft bristled brush and a rag.Make sure to use a sponge or rag that you do not intend to use washing the body of the vehicle. Allow the cleaner to sit for a few minutes on the wheels and tires before spraying them off.  Use a hose to rinse the wheel and tire cleaners off, then rinse the rest of the car in its entirety. If there are any leaves or other debris on the car, you may want to remove them by hand before continuing to rinse the body.A lot of the dirt and road sludge should come off of the car as you rinse it. A high pressure nozzle will help get more of the tough to clean dirt off of the vehicle.  Fill a bucket with water and a bit of automotive soap. Soak a clean sponge in the soapy water and use it to begin washing the top of the body of the vehicle. Walk all the way around the vehicle cleaning the high portions of the body before moving lower.If it is a very large vehicle, you may choose to wash only sections, such as the front of the vehicle, at a time. Don’t apply soapy water to a vehicle in direct sunlight or it may dry onto the paint.  Once you have washed the entire body of the vehicle, rinse it thoroughly to ensure no soap can remain and dry on the paint. Just as you did with soaping it up, start rinsing at the top and ensure all the soap has been washed away before moving lower.Soap can dry onto paint, causing it to look duller. Removing dried soap can remove wax and even damage clearcoat.  You can use a towel to dry the vehicle, or you may choose to allow it to air dry. Once the vehicle is dry, use the applicator sponge that comes with automotive wax to apply a fresh coat to the painted metal portions of the exterior of your vehicle.Even if you use a towel, you will need to wait until the water dries in the small crevices all around the vehicle before you wax. Apply the wax to the entire body of the vehicle, then give it time to dry.  Most automotive wax will turn a white, chalky color upon drying enough to be buffed off. Check by touching the wax with your index finger. If it rubs away beneath your finger without you having to apply much pressure, it’s ready to be buffed off. Use a chamois towel and wipe the wax away in circular motions to reveal shiny paint beneath.If your chamois towel gets dirty, swap it out for another one. You don’t want to buff dirty into the new wax.	Clean out trash and personal items. Vacuum the carpets. Wipe down plastic surfaces with interior cleaner. Use leather cleaner on leather parts. Wipe down interior and exterior glass. Use a carpet shampooer or stain remover if necessary. Warm the engine up for five minutes. Disconnect the battery and cover exposed wiring. Apply engine degreaser. Use a brush to scrub stuck on grime. Rinse the engine with a hose. Apply wheel and tire cleaner. Rinse the car with clean water. Use a sponge and soapy water to clean the body. Rinse the entire vehicle. Once the vehicle is dry, apply a coat of wax. Buff the wax off once it dries.
,  Find a stud or a joist if you plan to hang your bike from the ceiling. To do this, you can either get a stud finder or, if your ceiling walls are finished, look for a line of nail heads through the paneling or drywall.       Measure to decide where your mounting hardware will attach to the wall. If you have a helper, have this person hold the bike where you want it to hang so that you can mark where the mounting screws will go.       Pre-drill holes for the mounting screws. Make sure the holes go into the middle of the stud or joist. Use larger screws screws (~2 inch, #10) for a ceiling mounted hook than for a wall mounted hook.       Attach the mounting hardware and try it out. Hang and retrieve the bike several times to make sure it works as you intended. Note: This step is particularly important for children to try, because you must make sure they are able to hang and retrieve their bikes.	Visit a bike shop, hardware or home improvement store to purchase the necessary materials.  , Install your hardware.
Even if you know the story like the back of your hand, you still need to write it down. Include every detail you'd like to include in the song. This step sounds simple but once you start becomes very difficult when you try to include everything. Keep it short enough to turn into lyrics unless you plan on writing a hip hop ballad.; , Underline the details that correspond to the important parts. Take out all the unimportant bits that won't be going into the song, and then rewrite it onto another sheet of paper if you'd like, to keep it clean.  Make sure it rhymes, and put each stanza together so that it forms one long poem. These will be the verses to your song, since they tell the story well.  This is a little harder, since the chorus usually doesn't tell a story- it basically sums it up. Stop and think: what is the main feeling you want the story to give? If it's a happy song about something encouraging, try to write a stanza describing that happiness. If it tells the story of a break up, make the chorus a reflection of the feelings you had going through the break up.  A pre-chorus is just a short couple of lines that comes before the chorus but isn't actually part of the chorus. An example of a pre-chorus would be in Taylor Swift's "You Belong With Me," when she sings "she wears short skirts, I wear t-shirts, she's cheer captain..." until it reaches the chorus. This step is optional.  Generally this is only 1-2 lines that repeat over a few times towards the end of the song. The bridge doesn't have to have anything to do with the chorus- you could make it focus on a certain part of the story, or the entire story at once.  Figure out the order in which you're going to put the verses and the chorus. A popular form is Verse, Pre-Chorus, Chorus, Verse, Pre-Chorus, Chorus, Bridge, Verse, Chorus.  Now that you have the actual lyrics, put them to a tune or ask someone else to write one for you if you struggle with it. Once you have a tune, you can sing your very own song and share it with others! Congratulations- you have just written your very own hip hop song based on a story!	Write out your story. Take a highlighter and highlight the 2-4 most important parts. Write one stanza (usually 4-6 lines) for each main detail of the story. The next step is to think of the chorus. Write out a pre-chorus if you feel the song needs one. Write the bridge to the song. Decide on a song format. Write a catchy tune!
If you are going to include items that need to sit at the bottom of the bucket (like a tree branch, etc.) make room so that you can fit the piece on the bottom.  If you have large, protruding items, add them first to the bucket and then you can build around them.  For example, if you include a few protruding birch tree branches, surround the branches with pine cones and embed small twinkling lights around the pine cones to add sparkle.  The smallest, special touches should be added after your structure has been created. This includes touches of glitter, lights or small berries.	Fill the bucket with newspaper or filler so that your items will sit at the top of the bucket and on display. Add longest/largest piece first and then work around that focal point. Build natural items around each other and add touches of holiday magic. Add final touches after the basic elements are in place.
Get the stuff that you need. This will be included at the "Things You'll Need" section of this article.; , Make sure that everything is well away of the fire-prone places, such as dryers and chimneys. It is recommended that you add a screen at the fireplace in the family room to prevent chimney fire. Make sure that you throw out the dust filter that filters the clothes in your dryer. You should do this monthly, or after 10 sets of clothes. Also check to see if any pipelines that connect the dryer aren't clogged. If you do find a clot, do not use the dryer, and call a plumber. If you need to dry clothes, dry them on a clothes-hanger outside at your deck.  Make sure that you have 2 exits out of your house when the fire comes. Discuss with your family on where to go from every room that is frequently used (e.g. Bathroom). Sound an alarm to do some drills with your family, and that you are confident with it.	Prepare. Check. Do some drills.
There are two general methods of propagating zucchini - either by planting seeds, or by purchasing a small pre-existing zucchini plant and transplanting it to your garden. If you choose to grow your zucchini from seeds, you’ll have to start your seeds 4-6 weeks prior to the planting time outdoors for your environment/location. Grabbing a pre-potted plant is always easier and less time-consuming, but may not be as fulfilling as starting your zucchini from seeds.   There are a few kinds of zucchini, but the squash are all generally the same. You might see zucchini as classified as ‘open habit’ or ‘dense habit’, which refers to the way the leaves grow on the bush (sprawling/vine-y or bush-like). Most bush varieties of zucchini are considered summer squash, while vine varieties are considered winter squash. Zucchini will vary naturally between a yellow-ish hue and a green so dark it is nearly black. Some have very mild stripes/spots, this is normal and should not be concerning.; , Zucchini is typically considered a summer squash, because it thrives and produces the best fruit in summer. Some varieties are considered winter squashes, but this has to do with the time of fruiting, rather than the time of planting. Zucchini are sun loving and won’t do well in cold soil. Therefore, plant your zucchini when the temperature of the soil outdoors is at least 55 °F (13 °C). This is normally after the first or second week of spring, after all chance of frost have passed.If you’re not sure when to plant, call your local agricultural extension for detailed information on planting times for zucchini in your area.  Zucchini will thrive in an area that gets full sunlight with plenty of room to spread out. Find a location in your garden that will supply the zucchini with at least 6-10 hours of sunlight per day, and that lacks too much shade. Be sure to select a plot that has well draining soil; zucchini like moist soil, but not soggy soil.   If necessary, improve drainage by planting the zucchini on soil mounds, or through larger changes such as soil amendment and drainage systems. Plant in an area with southern exposure for maximum sun (or northern exposure in the Southern Hemisphere).  Although not everyone has the time to, preparing soil several months in advance will allow for the best growing conditions for your zucchini. Start by mixing in a gardening mulch and fertilizer, to supply the soil with the necessary nutrients. Test the soil pH, and amend it if necessary; zucchini prefer a soil environment with a pH between 6 and 7.5. To make the soil more acidic (lower pH), mix in peat moss or pine needles. To make the soil more alkaline (higher pH), mix in lime.To add nutrients and organic material, till compost into the soil a month before planting, then cover with mulch until time to plant. If your soil does not drain well, mix in some sand to help encourage water drainage.  If you’d rather not take chances of sowing your seeds directly into the soil, you can start your zucchini seeds indoors 4-6 weeks prior to transplanting them outdoors. Grab seed trays, soil-less potting mixture, and your seeds. Place a single seed in each tray, cover with ⅛ inch of potting mixture, and water well! These should be placed in an area that gets sunlight and is at least 60 °F (16 °C). When the second set of leaves have sprouted, the zucchini starts are ready to be transplanted outdoors.  Use a gardening trowel to dig a small hole for your zucchini plant. If you’re planting seeds, you’ll need to stick each seed less than ½-inch under the soil. For zucchini starts, dig each hole to be slightly larger than the root ball on your plant. Keep 75–100 centimeter (39.4 in) space between each plant (same distance for row space). You can thin out seedlings if needed.  Place each zucchini seed or start into its own individual hole. Cover seeds with ¼ or ½ inch of soil, so that they are able to get the necessary sunlight and water for germinating. Cover up a zucchini transplant with enough soil to cover the root ball without reaching up the stem. Finish up planting with a heavy watering, and you’re done!  , Keep an eye on your zucchini as they begin to grow. They’re relatively low-maintenance plants, but they do require a bit of upkeep in order to stay in tip-top producing condition. Pull out any weeds on site, and apply a layer of mulch if weeds continue to be a problem. Add a liquid growth fertilizer every 3-4 weeks to help promote growth in your zucchini. Cut off any diseased or dying fruit or branches to prevent disease from spreading to other parts of the plant, and to promote continuous growth., In order for your plant to start producing zucchini fruit, it has to become pollinated. If you lack bees or other pollinating insects in your area, or if your zucchini plant doesn’t seem to be producing any squash, you can pollinate your plant on your own. Pick a male zucchini flower, identifiable by its long stem, slender stem, and a visible stamen in the center. Carefully pull back the blossoms on the stem, and rub the stamen inside a female zucchini flower. Female zucchini flowers have short stems, a bulbous growth where the flower meets the stem, and lack stamens.You can do this to several flowers or just a few, depending on the amount of time you have and the growth you’re trying to promote.  When zucchini have grown to at least 4-inches in length, they are ready to be picked. Picking zucchini regularly promotes more squash production. Therefore, if you want lots of the squash, then pick all the zucchinis as they reach maturity. If you don’t have a need for too many squash, leave one or two zucchinis on the vine for the whole growing season to slow down the production. To harvest your zucchini, use a sharp knife to sever the squash from the rough stem that attaches it to the bush.   Enjoy the flowers in salads. These are edible and if you pick them, there won't be so many zucchini fruits growing. Crops will continue to grow until the first frosts if they established well during spring. You can simply cut the stem of a zucchini to promote growth, if you don’t want to harvest all of your squash yet.	Decide how you’re going to start your zucchini. Know when to plant. Find the perfect planting location. Prepare your soil. Start your seeds. Prepare your plot. Plant your zucchini. Maintain your zucchini plants. Promote growth. Harvest your zucchini.

It needs to be sheltered, and have some shade during the day. Somewhere near the herb garden or veggie patch is ideal, especially if it's easy to reach from your kitchen.;	Select a large space in your garden.
Unplug the cooler and turn off the water. Then remove the panels. Once the panels are removed, take out the used fiber pads., Open the drain plug if the swamp cooler has one. Allow the water to drain out. If there is no plug, siphon the water out with a hose.If you have a portable swamp cooler, make sure you drain the water outside and not inside your house. For window-mounted swamp coolers, you can leave it mounted in the window and let it drain outside the window. You may also choose to unmount it for maintenance and then put it back in the window.  Use a stiff brush or broom to sweep the inside of the swamp cooler. After you brush the debris and dirt loose, use a small vacuum that can be used on wet and dry surfaces to vacuum up the dirt.Debris can get inside the water pan. This can cause blockages that stop up the cooler, and may lead to unclean water cycling through it.  To clean the water reservoir, pour distilled white vinegar inside it. Let the vinegar sit in the water reservoir for an hour. You can also rinse the water tank with mild soap and warm water. Rinse the water tank well.When the time is up, drain the vinegar or soapy water into a bucket.  Use a scrub brush or cloth to clean the bottom of the water reservoir. Make sure to remove all stains and buildup, scrubbing harder if necessary. Rinse the water reservoir with clean water after you finish scrubbing.	Remove the panels and take out the fiber pads. Drain the water out of the swamp cooler. Brush out the inside of the swamp cooler. Soak the reservoir with vinegar. Scrub the water reservoir.
You can design and print a label using adhesive paper, or you can make a label from scratch using a piece of paper and clear tape. Make the label after you have poured the Mod Podge into the container and shaken it up. Here is how you can make a label from scratch, without a computer or printer:Write "Mod Podge" or "Decoupage" on a small piece of paper. Cut a piece of clear, packaging tape that is bigger than your label. Place the label face down onto the middle of the piece of tape. Wrap the packing tape around the glass container. Smooth the tape down to rid the label of any air bubbles.  Simply apply a thin layer of Mod Podge to the area you want decorated using a paint brush. You can also use a foam brush as well. Press your fabric or paper onto the wet Mod Podge, making sure to smooth out any ripples, bubbles or creases. Apply a second, thin layer of Mod Podge on top of your fabric or paper. You can always apply another coat of Mod Podge after the first one has dried., If you made Mod Podge out of glue and water, you can add a few drops of food coloring, and then paint it over some mason jars. This will create colored mason jars. Be sure to add 2 tablespoons of water-based gloss or varnish to your Mod Podge, or else the jars will be matte and frosted-looking.   If you wish to create tinted mason jars that look like sea glass, then omit the varnish.  Your homemade Mod Podge will not be as durable as the store-bought variety. You can make it more durable by wait until it has dried completely (several hours) and then applying spray-on acrylic sealer.   Simply hold the can six to eight inches away from the surface and spray the paint on using light, even strokes. Once the sealer has dried, you may add a second coat, if necessary. If you added varnish or glitter to your Mod Podge to make it glossy, be sure that you use an acrylic sealer with a gloss finish.	Consider adding a label the jar. Use Mod Podge to decorate boxes and other items. Consider tinting your Mod Podge. Consider sealing your project.
There are many resources online that use calculators to determine watts. They will do the formula for you.Such resources typically ask you to enter the number of volts, and the number of amps. Then you are asked to hit the “calculate” button to get the watts. Keep in mind, though, that online calculators aren’t always accurate because every appliance is going to be slightly different in its power needs. Some online sites will give you the watts needed if you click on the appliance type, such as a television or desktop computer.Sites sometimes have charts that list the watts used by various appliances, from refrigerators to boom boxes., You can figure out how many watts an appliance needs by looking for the data plate.   Find this on the back of your appliance. It’s likely to list how many volts, amps, and watts you need to power your appliance. You might find this information stamped on the back of the appliance. Or you could find the wattage listed on the nameplate.Wattage meters plug into the appliance, and they tell you the exact amount of power that the appliance needs to run. The wattage of an appliance might vary depending on its setting. For example, a radio is going to use more watts if you turn the volume on high.	Find an online calculator. Check your appliance.
You can use just about any type of fabric for this project. It should be about three times the height and width of your pillow., Lay the fabric down, wrong side up, on a flat surface. Set your pillow on top of the fabric. Make sure that it is centered., Fold the top edge of the fabric over the pillow and smooth it down. Repeat with the bottom edge. Make sure that the fabric to either side of the pillow is smooth., Smooth the fabric to the left side of the pillow down first. Fold the top edge down at an angle towards the center, then fold the bottom edge up to meet it. When you are done, you should have a "<" shape., Do the same thing you just did for the left side. Fold the top edge down at an angle, then the bottom edge. When you are done, you should have a ">" shape., Fold the left side down first, then the right. Make sure that they are still folded into points., A square knot is essentially a double-knot.Use the same knot as when starting to tie your shoes. Instead of doing the same knot twice, you reverse them: right-over-left, then left-over-right.Keep the fabric folded into points.  If you need to, tuck then inside the knot for extra security.	Cut your fabric. Place your pillow on top of the fabric. Fold the top and bottom edges of the fabric over the pillow. Fold the left side of the fabric into a point. Fold the right side of the fabric to a point. Wrap the sides of the fabric over the front of the pillow. Tie the ends of the fabric into a square knot. Tuck the ends of the fabrics under the knot.
If you care for fabrics incorrectly, then you could create a fire hazard. For example, some materials cannot be placed in the dryer. Make sure that you read all of your clothing labels so that you do not accidentally create a hazard., If you line dry items, make sure that they are located away from heat sources, such as your dryer, iron, or radiator. If the clothes came in contact with the hot appliance, they could become a fire hazard.Even if they don’t catch fire, you could damage your clothes.  Because your iron is small, it’s easy to overlook it; however, irons are still a source of heat. If you accidentally leave a hot iron laying with the hot side down, it could ignite the item it’s on, especially if it’s on your ironing board.   Always check your iron to make sure that it’s turned off before you walk away. Make a habit of not leaving your iron with the hot side down. To stay safe, unplug your iron between uses.  Piles of laundry can create a hazard by overheating a power cord, hiding damage, or falling behind machines. Instead, store both clean and dirty laundry in either laundry baskets or a hamper.  Items like paint, stain removers, gasoline cans, or chemicals need to be stored away from your hot appliances, such as your dryer, iron, hot water heater, or radiator.If you can store the items elsewhere, it’s best to relocate them to an area that doesn’t have so many heat sources.	Read the care labels on your clothing. Hang your clothes in a safe location. Use your iron safely. Avoid piling laundry on the floor or appliances. Avoid storing combustible materials near hot appliances.
If your vehicle was built prior to 1996, you will need an OBD I scanner. Vehicles made after 1996 will need an OBD II scanner. Connect the code scanner to the port beneath the dashboard and turn it on. Once connected, use the scanner to bring up the error codes making the check engine light come on.In some code scanners, it will provide the English description of the error code on the read out. If your code scanner does not, you will need to look up the code the scanner shows you to find out what it is.  Insert the key into the ignition and start the engine. Wait a minute for the engine idle to level off, then use a pen and paper to write down the RPMs that your engine settles and idles at.You may need to let the engine run for a few minutes in order for it to come down to its normal idle speed. Keep the paper you write the RPMs on handy so you can compare it to the engine’s idle as you continue the test.  With the idle RPMs noted, shut the vehicle back off and remove the key from the ignition. Open the hood and locate the Idle Control Motor. Once you locate it, disconnect it.The way to disconnect your Idle Control Motor will vary from application to application; refer to your vehicle’s service manual for more specific instruction as to how to disconnect it. You can usually disconnect the idle control motor by unplugging the wiring clip going into it.  With the Idle Control Motor disconnected, get back into the vehicle and start the engine again. The engine should still start and run without any issue despite the idle control motor being disconnected.Be sure to tuck the wiring you disconnected up in the engine bay so it doesn’t get caught in any moving parts.  Allow the engine to run for a minute so it settles to a consistent idle, then take note of any difference in the idle RPMs versus the idle you observed earlier. If the idle has not changed at all, it’s likely because your idle control motor has not been functioning.If the idle control motor was working, disconnecting it should have created a difference in the engine’s idle. This test confirms there’s an issue with the idle control motor, but not what the issue may be.  If you identified a difference in engine idle RPMs with the Idle control motor connected and disconnected, confirm your hypothesis by reconnecting it and starting the engine again.The idle should go back to what it was when the idle control motor was last connected. Refer to the note you took about idle RPMs to compare it to your first reading.	Use a code scanner to check error codes. Start the engine and take note of the idle RPMs. Shut the car off and disconnect the Idle Control Motor. Restart the engine. Look for a difference in idle speed. Shut off the engine and reconnect the Idle Control Motor.
You want to make sure that the company you are going to sign with is a legitimate, experienced company that is going to make money for you. You’ll want to look at things like:Their length of experience in the business Their credit list - the artists they have worked with The terms of the deal they are offering Their professionalism and look of their web site; , Word of mouth is a powerful tool in the music business. If you know other singers or songwriters who have already licensed their music, find out who they have worked with. Ask if they have been satisfied with their deals and with the money they have received. The way a company treats one artist is a sign of how they’re going to treat you., Get out and meet people in the business. Listen to what kind of music is getting played, and where it’s getting played. Try to determine where your music will fit in. Licensing may include TV commercials, TV and movie background music, theme songs. Even licensing for background elevator music brings in money and leads to exposure. Do the research to figure out where you are going to have the best chances to get your sound out there.	Research licensing companies online. Talk with other artists you know. Attend music conventions.
Most modern vehicles have a serpentine belt instead of a fan belt, though the names may be used interchangeably. Older model vehicles and some high performance applications still utilize fan belts instead of electric fans. Older belts were made of neoprene and would benefit from the application of belt dressing, but newer EPDM-made belts may dry out as a result of using belt dressing.If your fan belt was installed after the year 2000, it is likely an EPDM-made belt. The two belts are difficult to tell apart visually until they are worn out and need to be replaced.; , You will need to apply the belt dressing directly onto the belt. In order to do so, you will need to open the hood of the vehicle and remove any cowl cover that may be in place over the fan belt itself. This may require the use of some basic hand tools like a socket or hand wrench.Some vehicles have engine covers that will need to be removed. You will need direct line of sight and access to the belt while the engine is running.  The fan belt will likely be located at the front of the engine, attached to a pulley that rotates the cooling fan or fans for the radiator. It will often be black or grey. You may be able to locate it faster by starting at the radiator fan and working backward.In many older American vehicles, the fan belt is connected to shaft with a large metal fan at the end and is easy to identify. Serpentine or accessory belts that serve the same function as a fan belt may be on the side of a horizontally mounted engine.  Ensure the vehicle is in park with the parking brake engaged, then start the engine. You will need the engine to be running in order to apply the belt dressing evenly over the entire length of the belt.Leave the hood open and engine covers removed when starting the engine.  With the engine running, spray the belt dressing directly onto the back of the fan belt. As the engine runs, the fan belt will be moving quickly, so you can leave the can in one place and spray onto the belt as it spins.Spray the belt dressing onto the belt until the entire belt is wet. The squeaking from the fan belt should stop almost immediately.	Ensure your vehicle is equipped with a neoprene belt. Open the hood. Locate the fan belt. Start the vehicle. Spray the belt dressing directly onto the belt.
The antenna is one of the simplest parts of a homemade radio: all you need is a long piece of wire and a small cylinder. Ideally, the wire should be 50 feet long, but if you don’t have that much, you can use 15 or 20 feet. Use any small diameter insulated wire, like a 20 or 22 gauge., In this radio circuit, you'll need to make a simple inductor. Inductors store energy in the form of a magnetic field, though the specifics and behaviors of inductors is a little complicated. You can make your own by wrapping wire around a small cylinder. Find a small cylinder. You can use a glass bottle, a cardboard tube, or any other cylinder you can find from around the house. Just make sure it’s not metal, because metal will conduct electricity and throw off your signal. Look for any object with a 2-3 inch diameter. Gather five inches of slack, then tape the wire to the cylinder at the five-inch point. You can use electrical tape, or any other tape you have on hand. Begin wrapping the wire around the cylinder slowly, pushing the coils together to avoid gaps. Continue wrapping until the whole cylinder is coiled with wire. Tape off the end, then measure another five inches of slack. Cut the wire off at the five-inch point. You should now have a cylinder completely coiled over with five inches of slack on either side.  Tuning capacitors set a resonance frequency for the radio, meaning that they allow you to tune in to certain resonances of the medium wave radio bands.Variable tuning capacitors aren’t too expensive, costing around 10-15 dollars if you buy online at sites like Amazon. You may also be able to find one at a local electronics or hobby store like Radio Shack.  Capacitors and resistors are small electronic components that affect the flow of electricity in different ways. Capacitance is measured in farads (F), while resistance is measured in ohms (Ω). These measurements help you to know which type of capacitors and resistors to buy.Buy one 33pF (pico-farad) capacitor, one 10nF (nano-farad) capacitor and one 22uF (micro-farad) electrolytic capacitor. Capacitors can be bought from a variety of online shops and electronics hobby stores very cheaply, with most vendors selling these specific parts from between two cents and 25 cents.Buy one 1 megohm resistor. Keep in mind that “one megohm” may be abbreviated as “1.0M Ohm” As with the capacitor, shop online or look at electronics shop, and expect prices to range from 10 cents to 25 cents. Always buy extras of your components. These pieces are very small, and are made inexpensively, so it’s not uncommon to get a faulty piece every once in a while.  Amplifiers help us take the small signals that we pick up from the radio waves and make them bigger so that we can hear them. For this radio, we’ll use something called an operational amplifier, or op-amp. Op-amps are small integrated circuits with 8 prongs, and they look a bit like small spiders.Look online for a “general purpose” op amp. Search on Amazon or in Mouser Electronics’ catalog, and look for amps in the four to seven dollar price range., Speakers receive voltage amplified by the op amp and turn them into sound waves that we can hear. The voltage moves a magnet, which in turn moves a cone that produces the sound waves.If you have a speaker around the house, feel free to use it. Otherwise, look online for any kind of small speaker with two speaker-wire leads (not the kind that plugs in with a headphone jack).  Breadboards allow you to create a mockup of a circuit without requiring any soldering. They have many rows and columns of holes, and electrical connections can be made by simply placing component wires into adjacent holes.Breadboards are an inexpensive investment for anyone with an interest in electronics, as they’re easy to use and can be changed over and over again to create new circuits. Look online or in a hobby store, where they’re sold for five to ten dollars.  You’ll need a bit of wire in two different colors to make into jumpers. You’ll also use it to attach to the ends of your power source. Make sure you have around 10 or 15 inches of each color.  This particular circuit requires 9 volts of electricity to function. Any variety of 9 volt battery will work. Tape one five inch wire to the negative (flat) end and one five inch wire to the positive (raised) end with electrical tape to get it ready for attachment.   Cut two five-inch pieces of shielded wire. One will attach to each pole of the battery, and then to the circuit board. Using wire strippers or a sharp knife, cut 1-2mm of shielding off of each end of the wires. Tape one exposed-metal end of one wire to the positive (raised) end of the battery, using electrical tape. Tape the other wire to the negative (flat) end of the battery, again using electrical tape.  Lay your breadboard on the table in front of you “long-wise” so that the long edge is facing towards you and the short edges are on the outside. It doesn’t matter which side is on top, because both halves of the breadboard work the same way. Connectivity is achieved by placing components adjacently into the short columns, not the long rows.The only exceptions are the long, connected rows at the top and bottoms of the breadboard. These connect left-to right, not up and down.  Most breadboards have a long trough running across the middle, separating the board into two equal halves. You’ll want to place your op-amp so that four legs are on one side of the trough and four legs are on the other; four legs on the top half and four legs on the bottom half. This will allow you to build the input (the antenna) on one side of the breadboard and the output (the speaker and tuning capacitor) on the other side.         Be aware that the amplifier has a “front” and a “back”. The “front” of the op-amp has a small circular divot and the “back” does not. Make sure that the “front” is facing towards the left of the breadboard.  Current flows both ways over a resistor, so you don’t have to worry about it being “backwards” or “forwards”.Place one lead into the hole directly above the op-amp’s second leg on the top side of the amp. Place the other leg in the hole directly below the op-amp’s second leg on the bottom side of the amp. To clarify, “second leg” means second from the left, or “front” of the op-amp.  Place the short lead of your 10nF capacitor in the hole directly below the lead of your 1.0M Ohm resistor, on the bottom side of the breadboard. Next, place the long lead of your 10nF capacitor in a hole four columns over, to the left.  Most resistors and ceramic capacitors, like your 10nF and 33pF capacitors, let voltage travel over them in both directions. However, electrolytic capacitors do not: they are “polarized”. This means that they can only accept voltage going in one direction, and it needs to come in on the shorter, or positive leg. Do not apply voltage to the negative, or shorter leg: this can cause the capacitor to fail in a puff of smoke.On the top side of your breadboard, place the long lead of the 22uF capacitor in the hole directly above the top lead of your 1.0M resistor. Again, keep in mind that capacitors only allow voltage to flow in one direction, so the long lead needs to be the one connected to the resistor. Place the short lead in a hole four rows away from the long lead, to the right.  Get your black and red insulated wire. Cut one black jumper wire and one red jumper wire. Make sure they’re long enough to reach holes several rows away. Strip the insulation from one both ends of the jumpers. Using a pair of wire strippers, scissors, or a knife, cut off about 2cm of insulation from each end of the wire. This will allow the wire to form connectivity when placed into a hole on the breadboard.         Put one end of the red wire into the hole right above the first leg of the op amp, on the top side. Stick the other end into the long row at the top of the breadboard. Unlike the rest of the grid of the breadboard, which makes connections going up and down, this long row creates connections going left to right across the whole row. Place one end of the black jumper wire into the hole beneath the fourth, or furthest right leg of the op-amp, on the bottom side of the breadboard. Connect the remaining lead to the bottommost row of the breadboard.  This capacitor, like the first one you placed, isn’t polarized. There’s no backwards and forwards for this one, as it allows current to pass over it in both directions. It won’t matter which lead goes in which spot.   Look at your 10nF capacitor. One of the leads is attached to a bottom leg of the op-amp. The other isn’t connected to anything yet. Place one lead of your 22pF capacitor into the hole directly above this unconnected 10nF lead. Put the other lead of your 22pF capacitor into a hole four rows away, to the left. Make sure the row you place it in is empty.  Your antenna has remained unused up until this point, so let’s go ahead and attach it. Place one end of the antenna into the hole directly above the empty lead of the 22pF capacitor; the lead that you just placed four rows away to the left. Spool the rest of your wire out across the room, as far as the walls will allow you.  Place the variable capacitor on the table, on the top side of the breadboard. Connect one lead in the hole above the rightmost lead of your 22pF capacitor. Place the other lead in any hole on the bottommost row of the breadboard, where it will make connectivity with your black jumper wire.  Place the coil on the table below your breadboard. You saved five inches of slack on either side of the coil, so place the left-hand lead into a hole on the bottommost row, where it will connect to your variable capacitor and your black jumper wire. Place the right-hand lead in a hole in the row where your 22pF capacitor and your 10nF capacitor make connection with the variable capacitor’s lead.  Place your speaker on the table to the right of the variable capacitor. Your speaker will have one black lead and one red lead, so untwist them and get ready to plug them in. Put the red lead into any hole on the topmost row of the breadboard, where it will make connectivity with the red jumper wire. Place the black lead into the hole directly above the short lead of your 22uF electrolytic capacitor.  Now that your circuit is finished, give it some power. If you haven’t already used electrical tape to attach wires to the positive and negative sides of the battery, do that now. Remember, the flat end of the battery is negative, and the raised side of the battery is positive.         Place the positive wire into any hole on the bottommost row of the breadboard. It will now create connectivity with the black jumper wire and the variable capacitor. Place the negative wire into any hole on the topmost row of the breadboard, where it will make connectivity with the speaker and the red jumper wire.  Once the circuit has power, the electricity will begin to flow to the amp and the speaker. The speaker should now be making sound, whether it’s a faint radio signal or just static. This is a good indication that all of your components are correctly connected.  Turn the variable tuner slowly, listening for audible radio stations. The further away from AM radio stations you live, the weaker the signals will be. However, be patient and turn the knob slowly. You’ll easily find a station with a little patience.  All circuits are touchy, and many require troubleshooting, especially if this is the first circuit you’ve ever built. Make sure that all leads are firmly pressed into their holes, and that they are all in the correct spots. Continue to check connections until you hear audio. If it fails to work, it may be necessary to rebuild the circuit and repeat the steps again.	Make an antenna. Make a coil. Buy a variable tuning capacitor. Buy capacitors and a resistor.

Despite the all-in-one rocket ships popular in science fiction stories, going to the moon is a mission best broken into separate parts: achieving low-Earth orbit, transferring from Earth to lunar orbit, landing on the moon, and reversing the steps to return to Earth.   Some science fiction stories that depicted a more realistic approach to going to the moon had astronauts going to an orbiting space station where smaller rockets were docked that would take them to the moon and back to the station. Because the United States was in competition with the Soviet Union, this approach was not adopted; the space stations Skylab, Salyut, and the International Space Station were all put up after Project Apollo had ended. The Apollo project used the three-stage Saturn V rocket. The bottom-most first stage lifted the assembly off the launching pad to a height of 42 miles (68 km), the second stage boosted it almost to low Earth orbit, and the third stage pushed it into orbit and then toward the moon.The Constellation project proposed by NASA for a return to the moon in 2018 consists of a two different two-stage rockets. There are two different first stage rocket designs: a crew-only lifting stage consisting of a single five-segment rocket booster, the Ares I, and a crew-and-cargo lifting stage consisting of five rocket engines beneath an external fuel tank supplemented by two five-segment solid rocket boosters, the Ares V. The second stage for both versions uses a single-liquid fuel engine. The heavy lifting assembly would carry the lunar orbital capsule and lander, which the astronauts would transfer to when the two rocket systems dock.; , Because the moon has no atmosphere, you have to bring your own oxygen so you have something to breathe while you’re there, and when you stroll about on the lunar surface you need to be in a spacesuit to protect yourself from the blazing heat of the two-week-long lunar day or the mind-numbing cold of the equally long lunar night – not to mention the radiation and micro-meteoroids the lack of atmosphere exposes the surface to.You’ll also need to have something to eat. Most of the foods used by the astronauts in space missions have to be freeze-dried and concentrated to reduce their weight and then be reconstituted by adding water when eaten.They also need to be high-protein foods to minimize the amount of body waste generated after eating. (At least you can wash them down with Tang.) Everything you take into space with you adds weight, which increases the amount of fuel necessary to lift it and the rocket carrying it into space, so you won’t be able to take too many personal effects into space – and those lunar rocks will weigh 6 times as much on Earth as they do on the moon.  A launch window is the time range for launching the rocket from Earth to be able to land in the desired area of the moon during a time when there would be sufficient light for exploring the landing area. The launch window was actually defined two ways, as a monthly window and a daily window.   The monthly launch window takes advantage of where the planned landing area is with respect to the Earth and the sun. Because Earth’s gravity forces the moon to keep the same side facing Earth, exploration missions were chosen in areas of the Earth-facing side to make radio communication between Earth and the moon possible. The time also had to be chosen at a time when the sun was shining on the landing area. The daily launch window takes advantage of launch conditions, such as the angle at which the spacecraft would be launched, the performance of booster rockets, and the presence of a ship downsite from the launch to track the rocket’s flight progress. Early on, light conditions for launching were important, as daylight made it easier to oversee aborts on the launch pad or before achieving orbit, as well as being able to document aborts with photographs. As NASA gained more practice in overseeing missions, daylight launches were less necessary; Apollo 17 was launched at night., Ideally, a rocket bound for the moon should be launched vertically to take advantage of Earth’s rotation in helping it achieve orbital velocity. However, in Project Apollo, NASA allowed for a possible range of 18 degrees either direction from vertical without significantly compromising the launch., In escaping the pull of Earth’s gravity, there are two velocities to consider: escape velocity and orbital velocity. Escape velocity is the velocity needed to escape a planet’s gravity completely, while orbital velocity is the velocity needed to go into orbit around a planet. Escape velocity for Earth’s surface is about 25,000 mph or 7 miles per second (40,248 km/hr or 11.2 km/s), while orbital velocity at the surface is .Orbital velocity for Earth’s surface is only around 18,000 mph (7.9 km/s); it takes less energy to achieve orbital velocity than escape velocity.   Furthermore, the values for orbital and escape velocity drop the further away from Earth’s surface you go, with escape velocity always about 1.414 (the square root of 2) times orbital velocity., After achieving low Earth orbit and verifying that all ship’s systems are functional, it’s then time to fire thrusters and go to the moon.   With Project Apollo, this was done by firing the third-stage thrusters one last time to propel the spacecraft toward the moon.Along the way, the command/service module (CSM) separated from the third stage, turned around, and docked with the lunar excursion module (LEM) carried in the upper part of the third stage. With Project Constellation, the plan is to have the rocket carrying the crew and its command capsule dock in low Earth orbit with the departure stage and lunar lander brought up by the cargo rocket. The departure stage would then fire its thrusters and send the spacecraft to the moon.  Once the spacecraft enters the gravity of the moon, fire the thrusters to slow it down and place it in orbit around the moon.  Both Project Apollo and Project Constellation feature separate orbital and landing modules. The Apollo command module required that one of the three astronauts remain behind to pilot it, while the other two boarded the lunar module.Project Constellation’s orbital capsule is designed to be run automatically, so that all four of the astronauts it is designed to carry could board its lunar lander, if desired., Because the moon has no atmosphere, it is necessary to use rockets to slow the lunar lander’s descent to about 100 mph (160 km/hr) to ensure an intact landing and slower still to guarantee its passengers a soft landing.Ideally, the planned landing surface should be free of sizable boulders; this is why the Sea of Tranquility was chosen as the landing site for Apollo 11., Once you land on the moon, it’s time to take that one small step and explore the lunar surface. While there, you can gather lunar rocks and dust for analysis on Earth, and if you brought along a collapsible lunar rover as the Apollo 15, 16, and 17 missions did, you can even hot-rod on the lunar surface at up to 11.2 mph (18 km/hr).(Don’t bother to rev the engine, though; the unit is battery powered, and there’s no air to carry the sound of a revving engine, anyway.)  , After you’ve done your business on the moon, pack up your samples and tools and board your lunar lander for the return trip.   The Apollo lunar module was designed in two stages: a descent stage to get it down to the moon and an ascent stage to lift the astronauts back into lunar orbit. The descent stage was left behind on the moon (and so also was the lunar rover)., The Apollo command module and the Constellation orbital capsule are both designed to take astronauts from the moon back to Earth. The contents of the lunar landers are transferred to the orbiters, and the lunar landers are then un-docked, to eventually crash back to the moon., The main thruster on the Apollo and Constellation service modules is fired to escape the moon’s gravity, and the spacecraft is directed back to Earth. On entering Earth’s gravity, the service module thruster is pointed toward Earth and fired again to slow the command capsule down before being jettisoned.  The command module/capsule’s heat shield is exposed to protect the astronauts from the heat of re-entry. As the vessel enters the thicker part of Earth’s atmosphere, parachutes are deployed to slow the capsule further.   For Project Apollo, the command module splashed down in the ocean, as previous manned NASA missions had done, and was recovered by a Navy vessel. The command modules were not re-used.For Project Constellation, the plan is to touch down on land, as Soviet manned space missions did, with splashdown in the ocean an option if touchdown on land is not possible. The command capsule is designed to be refurbished, replacing its heat shield with a new one, and reused.	Plan to go in stages. Pack for the trip. Determine the launch window. Lift off.

Over time, your windows can collect dust and grime, preventing the maximum amount of sunlight to enter the room. This is an easy, and often forgotten, step to increasing the natural light that enters the room.Clean your windows with a commercial glass cleaner or homemade window cleaning solution.  Make sure that you are allowing as much natural light into the room as you can. If the room lacks windows, and it is within your budget, consider adding a window to allow more natural light to enter the room.Trim trees that block natural light from entering the room. Open the curtains and blinds during the day. Move furniture away from the windows.  If the room does not have another room or attic above it, consider installing a skylight. Skylights are windows that are installed in the ceiling of the room. Much light ceiling fixtures, they allow light to rain down in the room.Install a skylight in an interior room that cannot have a window.	Keep your windows clean. Take advantage of natural light.

Like most things, the first step to getting involved is getting informed and the internet is a great place to start. Take some time to browse your nearby theater's website, if they have one,and read about their mission state, what shows they are casting, if they have crew openings, if they are holding audition, or are in need of donations., They can help direct you and suggest whom to speak with further either by email, phone, or in-person.  Chances are you’ve already visited the theater before as a patron, but if not plan on checking out a show. Stick around after the show, too, and see if you can chat up current cast members. This is a good way to get a vibe of the troupe and get tips or pointers from someone already in the know.	Research your local theater online. Call and speak to a staff member. Visit in-person.
These cables have an HDMI plug on one end and a smaller HDMI plug on the other end, as opposed to traditional HDMI cables.  The 2017 line of Kindle Fire HD's does not support HDMI output. If your TV doesn't support HDMI input, you'll also need to buy an HDMI-to-analog converter box and a set of RCA male-to-male cables.  The large end of the cable should go into the TV, and the small end connects to your Kindle Fire HD's micro-HDMI port.  The micro-HDMI port is next to the charging port on the bottom of the Kindle Fire HD. If you're using an HDMI-to-analog converter: plug the Kindle Fire HD into the converter using the HDMI cable, then plug the converter into the TV with the RCA cables.  You should see your Kindle Fire HD's screen reflected on your TV's screen, though you may need to rotate your Kindle Fire HD in order for the display to appear right-side-up on your TV.  If necessary, you'll also need to change your TV's input to match the slot to which the Kindle Fire HD is attached (e.g., Video 3).	Buy an HDMI-to-micro-HDMI cable. Connect your Kindle Fire HD to your TV with the HDMI cable. Turn on your TV.
A comic book binder with clear plastic sleeves will help prevent folding and tearing when comic books are kept on a bookshelf or in a box. Using a filing cabinet is another option.   Paperback and hardback collections can be stored on a bookshelf as usual.  Store your comics in a dry area at room temperature. Keep them away from direct sunlight. If they are kept in a storage area instead of on the shelf, keep them in plastic bags to minimize water damage.  Keep issues from the same series together, and order them by issue number. Use folder dividers to separate series kept on the same shelf or in the same container.  Purchase plastic slips to further protect your most valuable issues. Keep these in a secure place in a designated area of your comic collection, so you can easily locate them. When handling them, wear latex gloves to prevent leaving traces of skin oil on the pages.	Keep comics in sturdy containers. Protect comics from heat and moisture. Organize your collection. Protect valuable comics.
Any type of household vinegar or even table salt in water can be used to antique brass. This can take longer to take effect than the other methods — several hours for vinegar, and up to several days with salt water— but you do not have to handle any dangerous chemicals and probably already have the necessary ingredients in your kitchen.   Prepare the brass first as described above to ensure the antiquing succeeds. Wear rubber gloves for any method to prevent getting oil on the brass.  A mix of equal parts table salt and water will oxidize the brass, simply speeding up the natural aging process brass undergoes. Apply it with a small paintbrush over the entire surface and reapply daily until you've achieved the appearance you enjoy., Apply with a brush or simply dip the piece in any type of vinegar. Allow it to dry, then apply an additional coat if you'd like a darker color.   Mix a spoonful of table salt into the vinegar for a greener patina.Heating the brass with a hair dryer or oven to around 450ºF (230ºC) will produce more noticeable results, but you'll need oven mitts or thick gardener gloves to handle it at this temperature., This may not achieve the authentic appearance that ammonia or antiquing solution will, but some people prefer the "gingerbread" appearance that results.In any case, it is certainly safer and less expensive than those methods.   Pour some vinegar into a plastic bucket with an airtight lid. Place wooden blocks or other objects into the bucket so a stable, flat surface is dry above the level of the vinegar. Place the brass on top of the objects. Seal the lid to trap the vinegar fumes and let them alter the brass for several hours or overnight.  Once the result you want is achieved, which may take several applications, wash the brass in warm water. Dry it gently with a towel or by applying heat.   Once it is dry, you have the option to preserve its color by coating with a brass lacquer or wax.	Use vinegar or salt water to antique your brass safely and easily. Apply salt water to make brass slightly darker. Coat with vinegar instead for more pronounced aging. Use vinegar vapors for a warm brown appearance. Whichever method you used, wash with warm water and dry.
Prepare as much as possible while the boat is on the trailer, and on dry land. Prepare the engine, fuel, safety gear, mooring lines, fenders, etc. You should be ready to drive the boat off the trailer right after it's backed down the ramp. Other people want to launch as well, and tempers will flare if you use dock time to do things you could have done in the parking lot. It is a good idea to have your own written checklist.; , If bringing along guests, brief them on where to go and what tasks to do. If bringing along children, forbid young children and pets from playing or loitering on a boat launch ramp as this is a roadway that transitions into a waterway. Keep children and pets supervised by an adult in a different area than at the boat launch ramp. NEVER let children or pets play or be unattended at a boat launch ramp.  Unplug the trailer towing light assembly from the vehicle's electrical system.  This is very important!  , Undo and stow the hold down straps, but leave the winch hook in the bow eye. , This is easiest done with two people: one driving and one as a spotter. With a truck or SUV it can be easier to see when backing up if you put the tailgate down or open the rear hatch/door/window. Drive slowly, making tiny fine-tune steering corrections as you go. How far to back the boat trailer into the water depends on many factors - type of trailer, depth of the water, type of boat, etc. A good rule of thumb is to back in until the water is just above the hubs on the trailer. Be careful about backing in too far otherwise the tow vehicle might become stuck.   When backing down the ramp, have the vehicle in neutral. This makes it easier to control the vehicle quickly. If something fails, quickly put it in gear and go forward.    When getting out of the vehicle on the ramp, apply the handbrake first, check that it is holding fast, and then put it in park. When the vehicle is sitting in park, the whole weight is sitting on a little piece of metal in the trans (parking pawl). Should this break and the park brake doesn't hold, you launch the whole rig. ,,,, Make sure the engine is in the water, and turn it over. Once it's running, undo the winch hook from the bow eye, and back the boat out of the trailer. For smaller boats, you can just push the boat out while holding a mooring line.  Tie the mooring lines to cleats on the dock. Use fenders to prevent the hull from being scratched.  Boat ramps can be slippery with moss and algae and it is important to not let the vehicle's tires spin. If your tow vehicle is equipped with four-wheel drive, this can be useful if your back tires start spinning. Once the boat is afloat and secured to the dock, drive the vehicle back up the ramp and park it at the landing, in the designated parking area.  Do not turn the boats steering wheel in the opposite direction of the dock, with the boat a mere few inches from the dock, and just hit the throttle - or your engine's outdrive will push your boat right into the dock, scratching or gouging the gelcoat in the side of the hull. Make sure that you have pushed away several feet from the boat dock before driving away, so that your stern has ample room to turn the boat without scraping the boat alongside of the dock.	Prepare the boat. Make a plan together. Unplug the trailer towing light assembly. Put the drain plug in the boat. Undo the hold down straps. Have your dock lines and fenders ready to go for immediate use.  , Back the trailer down the ramp. Ensure that your tow vehicle has the parking brake set before exiting the vehicle. Lower the lower unit (for boats with outboard and inboard-outboard engines).  , Turn on the bilge blower to remove any gasoline fumes that may have accumulated in the bilge.  , Ensure that no person is near the engine when starting and that no person or boat is in your path before you put the boat in reverse.  , Pay attention to currents, wind and waves that can easily pull your boat off course and into a collision course with another boat or dock.  , Crank the engine. Secure the boat to the dock. Slowly pull the vehicle out. When pulling away from the dock, it is important to understand that unlike a car, the stern of the boat is pushed to one side or the other, whereas a car's pivot point is in the front.
For a 12" wreath, you'll need about 60 yards (54.9 m) of ribbon total. Basically, cut loads and loads of ribbon. Most ribbon fabrics will work, but the stiffer the better. At such a short length, most will stay erect and fluffy. As for widths, you'll find it's easiest to work with ribbons around 1" (2.5 cm) wide or less.          Experiment with a bunch of different colors. Think about using a zinger fabric -- a handful of more muted colors and one color that really pops. Cut the ends at an angle. This is not only pretty, but keeps them from fraying as easily.; , Take one color and tie a handful of pieces at different points around the wreath. After a dozen or so are tied, switch colors. This guarantees an even gradient to your wreath.          Tie 'em tight! You don't want them coming undone. And make sure you cover all parts of the frame -- there might be some small pieces that aren't in the main circle, but provide structure.  Once you think you're getting done, scrunch the ribbons together. New spaces should form for you to tie in more. There should be some overlap -- this will make your wreath voluminous and full.  Though your wreath is beautiful now (and ready to hang!) you may add a few touches if you'd like. Does it feel like it's missing anything?          A thin sheen of spray glitter can add a nice touch to ribbon that's otherwise solid-colored and uniform. A giant bow on top may make your wreath seem more wreath-like and less like, well, a circle.	Cut your ribbon into 7-8" (18-20 cm) pieces. Tie knots of ribbon around the wreath form. Adjust the ribbons and squeeze in more. Add any finishing touches, if desired.
If your goal is to get your waterworks started, you may have to go over the top in your imagining. Usually, there is at least one thing, like mistreated animals or impoverished children, that you can’t help getting sad over. Use these to water up! Some other ideas that might get you teary-eyed include:   War Starvation Disease Death, Try to assume the position you were in at a time when you were teary-eyed for some reason. Then, as closely as you are able, mimic the motions, rate of breathing, and noises you made at that time. Though this might seem a little awkward, with practice your body’s muscle memory can be trained to activate your tear glands to water your eyes., You don’t have to be an actor to make use of actor’s tricks. By identifying with a character, either an imaginary one or a live-action one you’ve seen on TV, you can make yourself misty eyed.   Try to choose a character whose situation you can relate to. Relatable characters will make it easier for you to slip into their mindset, and from there, get the watering response going., Some phrases may have the ability to really upset you. Professional actors and acting teachers refer to this as a “power phrase” due to the fact that it can be used to give you power over your emotions. Simply repeat the phrase to yourself until you feel your eyes begin to moisten. Some examples of power phrases include:   ”I’m not good enough.” ”No one will ever love me.” ”I can’t do anything right.” ”Why does everybody leave me?”, Music can evoke a powerful emotion response inside of you, both in negative and positive ways. Think of a song that you find particularly depressing, and loop it in your head. You may also want to think about things you find sad or depressing as the music plays in your head.   To help yourself get into the mood to cue your eye watering, you might want to bring some headphones and a music player so you can listen to the sad song before you need your eyes to water. When it’s time to water up, take off the headphones and continue playing the song in your head until your tear glands begin to water.	Imagine things you find sad. Use muscle memory to trigger teary eyes. Assume a teary-eyed persona. Find your power phrase. Think about sad music.
Almond trees, which are native to the hot and arid climate of the Middle East and South Asia, do best with hot summers and mild winters and do not adapt to other conditions especially well. Almonds do not usually grow at all in colder climates.Unless you have a large, carefully-controlled indoor growing setup, you may have a hard time growing almonds outside of areas with a Mediterranean or Middle Eastern climate profile.   If you're in the US, a good way of determining whether your local climate is suitable for growing almonds is to use a USDA Plant Hardiness Zone Map.These maps rate geographical areas by their minimum temperatures, giving an approximate indication of the types of plants that can survive there. For almonds, you'll want your area to have a rating of at least "6" — higher is better. According to this system, suitable areas in the US include much of central and southern California as well as parts of Arizona, Texas, and inland Florida.; , You have two options for starting your almond tree — you can either use seeds (fresh, unprocessed nuts) or seedlings (young trees).Nuts allow you to experience the growing process from the very beginning, but can be more time and effort-intensive. On the other hand, seedlings are more convenient, but can be a little more expensive.   If you want to harvest edible almonds, you'll want to be sure to pick seeds or seedlings for a fruit-bearing sweet almond tree. Keep in mind that bitter almonds are inedible and that not all sweet almond trees bear fruit. These varieties are only suitable for shade and decoration. Talk to the staff at your local garden supply store if you're unsure of which almond trees are productive.  Almond trees do well with lots of sun. Before you get started, find a spot in your yard or garden that gets plenty of full, direct sun, free from shade. You will grow the almond tree in a pot prior to planting it in the ground, but it's still important to choose a location ahead of time — the tree will only fit in the pot for so long.   You'll also want to make sure your growing spot has well-draining soil. Almond trees don't do well if water is allowed to pool around their roots — this can lead to root rot.  If you're growing your almond tree from a seed (which are just almond nuts surrounded by their protective husks), start by germinating the seed in a controlled environment — once it's started, you can plant it in a pot or in the ground. First, gather your seeds in a single large bowl (the more you use, the better — some may not sprout or may succumb to mold). Then, germinate them according to the following steps:          Add water and let the seeds soak overnight. The next day, use a nutcracker to crack the almond shells open slightly — the shell should still hold itself together, but you should just be able to see the nut inside. Throw away any seeds that show signs of mold. Fill a few small flowerpots with potting soil. Make sure the pots have holes on the bottom for drainage. Plant the seeds an inch or two under the surface of the soil with the cracks pointing upward. Rest the flowerpot indoors in an area that will receive direct sunlight. Now, just wait for seedlings to sprout.  Once your seedlings have started to grow (or, alternatively, if you bought ready-to-plant seedlings), prepare your decided-upon spot in the ground for planting. Make a small mound an inch or two tall (and slightly wider than it is tall) for each seedling. Push the seedling about an inch into the center of the mound until it's below the surface of the soil. This mound technique helps prevent water from gathering around the roots of the plant as it grows, which can cause serious problems (including root rot).          If you're planting germinated seedlings, plant them at the end of winter or in the spring. Alternatively, if you're planting un-germinated seeds, plant them in late fall so that they have a chance to sprout in the spring at the very start of the bloom season.If planting multiple trees, space each tree at least about 20 feet (6.1 m) apart. This gives the trees' roots plenty of space and allows for easy, effective irrigation., Immediately after planting, almond trees should be "tanked" (watered heavily) with at least a gallon of water to thoroughly hydrate the soil.After this initial watering, you'll want to maintain a regular watering schedule as the tree grows. Almond trees thrive in hot climates, but they're not desert plants, so watering is vital to keep the growing plant healthy.         Water each almond plant at least once a week unless it rains. Established trees can survive on two or three inches of water without rain, but growing plants will usually require more.Alternatively, you may want to use a drip irrigation system. This is an especially convenient choice if you have many trees.  Once the growing season begins, it's appropriate to use a reasonable amount of fertilizer to boost your plant's growth (though this is not required). For young trees, you'll want to use small doses of Nitrogen every few weeks throughout the growing season. For mature trees, on the other hand, you'll want to use about two pounds of urea or 30 pounds of manure (applied once).   No matter what kind of fertilizer you're using, be sure to "water it in" after you apply it. Fertilizer can have a harmful "burning" effect on the plant if it's applied without water or an excessive amount is used at once., Fruit-bearing almond trees will start to grow small green fruits during the growing season — these hard, sour fruits aren't a common dish in the Western world, but are semi-popular in the Middle East. In the fall, these fruits will harden, turn brown, and crack open. Once the exposed almond husks have a dry, brown exterior, they're ready for harvesting. See below for more information on harvesting.   There are two types of almond tree: trees that grow "sweet" almonds and trees that grow "bitter" almonds. Bitter almonds and their fruit aren't safe for eating. Bitter almonds contain prussic acid, a toxic chemical. Just a handful of raw, unprocessed bitter almonds can potentially be deadly.However, it is possible to process bitter almonds with a special toxin-leaching process, rendering them edible.  Winter is the perfect time for pruning — the tree's dormant wood makes for safe, easy removal. Note, however, that dead or diseased limbs should be removed immediately at any time of the year. To prune branches, use a pair of garden clippers to make a clean cut near the bottom of the branch. For tougher pruning jobs, use a saw.          Pruning a tree encourages healthy, even, visually appealing growth. Smart pruning choices can also make a tree stronger, sturdier, and more resistant to certain diseases.When pruning, try to thin out especially dense areas of foliage and eliminate spots where two branches rub against one another. You'll also want to prune any stray branches that grow higher or further to the side than the others to encourage even growth., Almond trees take some time to start producing nuts. Typically, this "waiting" period lasts about five years. However, depending on the species of tree, it can take as long as 12 years for it to reach full nut-producing capacity. Be patient — a mature, healthy tree can produce over 40 pounds of nuts in a single harvest!   Once an almond tree begins bearing fruit, it will do so every year for as long as 50 years, ensuring plenty of almonds for years to come.  It's important to understand that most almond trees don't produce almonds "by default". The fruit of the almond tree (and, thus, the almonds themselves) are usually produced as a response to pollination as a method of sexual reproduction. This means that unless you have a self-pollinating variety of almond tree, you'll need to cross-pollinate your tree with another tree of a different variety to get almonds.          The easiest way to do this is usually just to have multiple trees of different varieties. Once you have two to three trees growing near each other, pollinators like bees will bring pollen from one tree to another as part of their natural behavior. You can also pollinate trees manually by taking a flower-bearing branch from another tree and rubbing it against the first tree's flowers, mixing the tree's pollen in the process. However, this is much more time-intensive and may not work as well as natural pollination.  Grafting will turn an unproductive tree into a productive one if the existing tree is not self-fertile and you graft on a scion from a different variety. Once the graft "sets", the grafted-on part will still have the ability to produce fruit, even if the rest of the tree doesn't. This is how the vast majority of certain crops like oranges are grown.          There are several ways to graft a productive limb onto your tree. The simplest is usually a technique called T-budding that involves making a long, narrow cut on the "host" tree and slipping the new limb into the groove formed. After this, the new limb is secured with string or rubber ties until the host tree accepts it. Note that most grafting is performed in the spring when the material under the bark is moist and green. Keep in mind that grafting will not make an unproductive tree productive if it isn't producing due to poor site selection, lack of nutrients, etc.  Almonds are usually harvested between July and October (in some countries like Saudi Arabia, it starts end of May) once the external fruit has dried and cracked open. Shake the tree and gather the almonds that drop, taking care to throw out any rotten ones you come across. Sometimes, the fruit may fall without the tree being shaken. Unless they begin to rot, these nuts are still edible.          After harvesting, it's a good idea to freeze your almond husks for 1-2 weeks to kill any residual pests., One problem that can affect nearly any tree (including the almond tree) is root rot. This harmful condition is caused mainly by fungi that start to grow on the tree's roots if they're in contact with water for too long. Since root rot can be very tough to treat, the best policy is prevention. Never over-water your tree — any sort of watering that results in standing water around the base of the tree can do much more harm than good.          To help prevent over-watering, you may want to increase the drainage capability of your soil. This can be done by mixing in plenty of extra hummus or organic matter to give it added permeability. Note that shallow, heavy, and clay-rich soils have especially bad drainage. If you have a case of root rot on your hands (usually signified by drought-like symptoms, including yellowing, wilting, and dying leaves), dig up the plant's roots and cut away any dark, slimy patches. If problems persist, dispose of the plant to prevent the fungus from spreading throughout your garden.  Weeds are not a huge concern for old, established almond trees, but they can be a serious threat to young seedlings. Weeds compete fiercely for the same nutrients, water, and sun as young almond trees. If ignored, weeds can even "strangle" a seedling before it has a chance to grow.The best policy for weeds, especially during your plant's first few months, is to start weeding early and often. Try to keep a five or six foot strip along each row of seedlings free of weeds — you can use manual methods (like your hands or garden tools) or herbicides to kill the weeds.You can use a layer of mulch, or landscaping fabric to control weeds. This works well for small, home orchards.  One particularly annoying almond pest is the navel orangeworm. Over the winter, this insect shelters in so-called "mummy" nuts — almonds that aren't harvested and are left on the tree into the late fall and winter. Once the spring rolls around, these grubs become active, resulting in damage to the almond crop. The best way to prevent this is simply to get rid of the mummies. Without any place to shelter over the winter, orangeworms should not appear, as they cannot penetrate healthy fruits later in the year.   After the mummies are removed from the tree, be sure to destroy them by mowing. Orangeworms can still shelter in intact mummies on the ground.  Peach twig borers are just what they sound like — small, grub-like insects that bore into stone fruits like peach and almonds. These insects can cause significant damage to almond crops with their feeding, so if you see these pesky bugs (or chewed-up leaves, which can signal their presence), use a pesticide immediately to protect your crop. Bacillus thuringiensis, a bacterial insecticide, is a great choice for killing borers. Time the spray with the spring hatching season to kill the insects before they have a chance to do significant damage.         In addition to the two examples above, a huge variety of additional pests can potentially attack almond trees — so many, in fact, that it's impossible to list them all here. For more information, use a search engine query for "almond pests" or contact your local garden supply store or a local university's botany department. You may also want to learn about integrated pest management. This is a method of controlling pests that combines biological, environmental, and chemical pest management techniques. It is more effective than using one method alone.	Make sure your area has proper almond growing conditions. Purchase seeds or seedlings. Choose a sunny location for the tree. Germinate the seeds. Transplant the sprouts. Water generously. Fertilize in the spring. Harvest nuts in the fall. Prune in early winter. Wait 5 years before expecting fruit. Be sure the tree is pollinated. Graft a different variety onto the tree as an alternative. Harvest the almonds when ripe. Avoid over-watering to prevent root rot. Practice good weed control. Keep the tree free of mummies to fight navel orangeworm. Use Bacillus thuringiensis spray for peach twig borers.
This method is cheap, quick, and easy — perfect if you don't want to spend money on specialty molds for making ice balls. All you'll need is a few round water balloons (and, of course, water and a freezer.)   Remember that, if you're using your ice balls to cool your drinks, they'll need to be able to fit inside your glasses. Thus, when it comes to water balloons, generally, the smaller, the better. ; , If you want color ice balls add two drops of food coloring when you do this. Grab a balloon, open the neck, and slide it over your faucet. Turn the water on at a low level so that it gradually fills the balloon. You want enough water so that you have a small globe that you can easily handle with one hand — this is probably a lot less than you'd use if you were going to have a water balloon fight.   Once again, you'll want to make sure that your ice balls are small enough to fit in whichever glass you plan to use. A good way to check this is to put your glass around the balloon as it fills. Keep in mind that water expands when it freezes, so you want to leave a little extra room on each side., When each balloon is full enough, remove it from the faucet and tie it off. Use tight knots — having a leaky balloon in your freezer can lead to an icy mess.  Now comes the easy part — waiting. Simply leave your water balloons in the fridge until they are frozen all the way through. For the most round shapes, don't pack the balloons into a container — they will push against each other and create oblong-shaped pieces of ice. Instead, give each balloon its own space on a plastic tray or baking sheet so that none are touching.   Note that, even with this precaution, ice balls made using this method won't be perfectly round. Instead, they'll have one side that's a little flattened (the side of the balloon that it was resting on.)  , Once your ice balls are completely frozen, they're ready to use. Simply use a knife or a pair of scissors to cut the balloon off each one and drop the (mostly) spherical pieces of ice into your drink. Voila!	Buy a package of water balloons. Fill your balloons with enough water to make small spheres. Tie the balloons. Leave the balloons in the fridge. Pop and peel off the balloon before using each ball.
With your hands even with your chest, rest your body on the ground, Keep your shoulders back and your hips forward to do the worm. Make sure you've stretched your back before attempting it., One of the most important parts of the move is keeping your toes curled in, so you can use them to push and create the distinctive "wave" that starts the move. You can't push up if your toes are pointed straight back. Use them to grip and push yourself up and forward once you've kicked.  Lift your feet so the bottoms of your feet are pointing straight up toward the sky. Practice donkey-kicking up and back to get your hips off the ground. This is the easiest way to get the move started, but takes some practice to get the physics of it right.  To try the first motion, kick your legs up and back. With your hips off the ground, push up with your hands as you would to do a regular push-up. Let your feet come down first and let your hips, stomach, and chest roll back forward to the push-up position. This will send that wave-like motion through your body.   Get the rhythm down and practice getting more of your body off the ground with each kick.  It's important to remember that the move starts from your toes. Keep them curled in and land with your toes ready to immediately push off again. Chain several of these 'kick-and-push' moves together to do the worm.  Once you've got the basic motion down, you can change the way the move starts, how many times you do it, and how high. You can also start the worm from a kneeling position by rolling forward from your knees and kicking up and back when you roll all the way forward onto your hands.   Try a backward worm by starting from a standing position. Put your hands on the ground and kick your legs up in the air as if you were about to do a handstand. Instead, let your body lower to the ground by rolling from the chest to the stomach and the hips. When your toes touch, push off as you normally would and push-up with your hands again. Your momentum should carry you in the opposite direction.	Go into a basic push-up position. Curl your toes in. Bring your legs up at a 90 degree angle. Kick and push. Land back on your toes. Try variations.
Obtaining the exact amount of money owed on your car loan will allow you to make financial plans regarding paying off the loan. If you do online banking, this information can be found under your account summary. Alternately, you can review your mailed monthly statement.; , You can request this from your financial institution in person or by logging in to your personal account on your lender's website. Speak directly with a loan adviser or review the terms and conditions of your loan to determine if penalties apply for paying the car loan off quickly.   Some banks or financial institutions may charge you fees or penalties for paying off the car loan sooner than the original life of the loan, especially if you cause them to lose money in interest. These are typically called "prepayment penalties."  , You can find online loan payoff calculators at Bankrate.com or MortgageLoan.com where you can plug in your loan's interest rate, monthly payment and payoff amount. Then you will be able to compare how much you can save by paying the car off in one lump sum, making payments twice a month, or increasing the amount of your monthly payments.If there are penalties for paying off your car loan early, compare the savings you calculated with the amount of the penalties. Then you will know if you will save money by paying off your loan early.  Your loan adviser may be able to educate you on the most beneficial way for you to pay off your car loan faster, especially if penalties apply. For example, ask your lender if they can decrease the balance of your car loan if you can pay the remaining balance in one lump sum.In some cases, lenders may lower the remaining balance of your car loan substantially if you can pay off the remaining balance with just one payment.  Some lenders may only charge you a fixed monthly interest, which can allow you to apply additional payments toward the principal amount. However, other lenders may charge you interest on every payment you make. Ask your lender if you can make additional payments toward the principal amount of the loan without having to pay interest. If so, you can plan to make small, additional payments toward the loan each month and pay less in interest over the life of the loan.   An example of the difference between the kinds of interest you pay is: if you have a $100 payment due every month with $4 interest that means you pay $104 per month. What you need to find out is if that $4 is a fixed amount per month, which would mean no matter how much you might pay on the principal ($100, $200, $300) you still pay just $4 monthly interest. If, however, they charge interest on every payment, you would end up paying 4% interest on whatever you are putting down on the principal -- $8 if you chose to pay $200 instead of $100, for example. Even if you have to pay interest on each payment, it is usually worth your while to make extra principal payments to pay your loan off faster.  Use a check or pay online to make an extra payment per month, that is separate from your regular car loan payment. Write “Principal Only” on the check so that the lender will not count it toward your loan payment for the next month.If you are paying online, pay the extra principal amount before you are billed for the next month.  Instead of making one monthly payment, split it in half and make payments every two weeks. This typically works out to twice per month, but by the end of the year you will have made two more biweekly payments (one full payment) because most months are longer than an exact 4 weeks. In other words, make 26 half payments per year (every other week for 52 weeks) that will equal 13 full payments, rather than the 12 you would've otherwise paid. This means that the total amount you owe will go down faster, saving you interest on the loan., Extra income such as tax refunds, bonuses from your job, or cash gifts from birthdays or holidays could be applied to your car loan, resulting in a faster payoff. You will be paying more in interest on your car loan than you would earn in a savings or money market account., If you have the time outside your normal work hours, consider starting a side business in order to generate additional money to pay down your car loan. Examples of side businesses are:   Rent out a room in your home. This could be for a student or someone staying in your town temporarily for a job. You can advertise this on your local craigslist.com. Mow lawns and/or shovel snow. Run errands for elderly people or busy professionals. Buy china, artwork, tools, jewelry, books, etc. for low prices at estate sales and flea markets and then sell them on eBay. Offer at-home party sales. Check out Tupperware, Pampered Chef, Longaberger baskets, Silpada jewelry, Mary Kay cosmetics, Cabi clothing and The Happy Gardener. If you organize a sales team you’ll be able to reap a percent of their profits as well.  If you have paid off one of your credit cards, for example, continue to pay that former monthly amount toward your car loan. Then you won't be tempted to spend it on other things.  Make a list of your monthly income and expenses, including expenses that occur only once or twice a year. Then you will be able to see if you have extra cash at the end of the month to pay down your car loan. If you don't have extra cash, look for areas where you can cut expenses.Eliminate expenses you do not need such as cable television channels or a landline telephone. The money you apply to costs such as these can be applied toward your car loan instead. Seek lower rates on mandatory expenses and bills such as auto insurance, internet bills, or cell phone bills by consulting with each of your service providers for bundled or promotional rates. You can get auto insurance quotes online to compare to your current policy. Lower your food expenses by cooking or preparing meals at home rather than eating out in restaurants. In most cases, a specific meal will cost significantly more if you purchase it from a restaurant than if you buy the meal or ingredients from a grocery store.  Banks will often have much better deals than car dealerships, so look at the loans offered at your bank. Talk to a bank employee about how the loans work, how much interest and what kind they charge, and if there are prepayment penalties. If you choose to take out a car loan with your bank, make sure to take the information about the bank and the loan to the car dealership so that they have the information.  Now that you've learned how to pay off a car loan faster, you know how detrimental it is if there are prepayment penalties. There are many choices of where to take out a car loan, so next time make sure you choose a financial institution that does not require prepayment penalties.  The fastest way to pay off a loan is to not take one out in the first place. If you were paying $300 a month for your car loan and the loan is now paid off, continue to put this amount in a savings or money market account. Then when you are ready to buy your next car you can pay in cash for a large down payment or the entire amount.  If you have started to make and follow a budget while cutting expenses, keep up these good habits. Put any money you save into a money market account to earn interest. Or if you don't plan on buying a new car for 3-5 years, you could invest this money in a certificate of deposit (CD). Then you will be able to make a large down payment or not have to take out a loan for your next car.	Determine the exact payoff amount of your car loan. Obtain a copy of your bank or loan agreement. Calculate savings as a result of making extra payments. Consult with your financial institution for loan payoff recommendations. Determine if you can make additional payments to the principal balance only. Make a separate payment for principal. Make biweekly payments. Apply extra earnings or cash gifts to your car loan. Earn extra income. Use the snowball technique. Establish a budget and minimize extra expenses. Ask about car loans at your bank. Don't take out a car loan with prepayment penalties. Continue paying yourself the monthly car payment. Continue to budget and cut expenses.
Kompa dancing is done in pairs, generally male and female. Many of the maneuvers in this style of dance are intimate, so be sure it is with a person you are comfortable with.; , While facing one another and standing straight, the man then places his right hand under the shoulder blade of his partner and intertwines her free hand with his own. The left arm must be at the height of the shoulders. The woman’s left hand must be placed at the top of her partner’s shoulder blade.  One of the more important steps to Kompa dancing is hip movement. Slightly bend your right knee and pick up your right foot as you move your hips toward that direction. When swaying to the right and hitting that step, simultaneously slightly bend the left knee and pick up the left foot while shifting your hips toward that direction. Doing this will help you build a rhythm.  While doing the same hip movement, move closer to your partner with the man now placing his right hand on his partner’s side, under her armpit and close to her breast. The woman places her entire left arm around her partner and places her left hand on her partner’s left shoulder blade. Doing this will create a stronger sense of guidance and direction for you and your partner.  Now that you and your partner have the hang of the first few steps, now it is time to get out of a stationary position. While doing the previous steps, move in a rhythmic pace frontward and backward. Be sure to move your leg simultaneously with your partner’s opposite leg. (If they move their left leg, move your right).  This step all depends on the chemistry your partner and you have with each other. While doing all the previously mentioned steps, add moving in a circular motion with your partner to it.	Find a partner. Grab each other and position your bodies. Sway the hips from side to side. Get closer. Move back and forth. Add a turn (optional).
A common goal to improve your overall health is to ditch the sugary drinks and increase water intake. This is a great goal as water is essential to your hydration and health.Increasing water consumption is a virtually free and painless way to instantly make a positive change for yourself.   Your long-term goal should be to drink about 64 oz or 2 L of clear, sugar-free fluids every day.Ditch sweetened beverages. Drinking more water is great, but skipping the sweetened beverages will help reduce your overall calorie intake and promote weight loss.If you're not drinking a lot of water now, start slowly. Add in one glass or one bottle of water every day. Or, swap out one soda or one energy drink for an equivalent amount of water. Slowly increase the amount of water you drink and decrease a number of sweetened beverages you drink. Don't drink your fruits. Give up drinking fruit juice and get all those wonderful nutrients from real, whole fruit. You'll get the added benefit of having the fiber from the fruit in addition to missing out on the liquid calories of fruit juice.  While you are increasing the amount of water you drink, you can also be strategic about when you drink it. Drinking a big glass of water (about eight oz) right before a meal or snack can help decrease your overall portion size and how many calories you consume.Try to make it a habit to drink water right before you eat. When you're stomach is more full on water, it can help decrease your hunger. This may lead to or help support your weight loss. You can also consume other no-calorie beverages including: sugar-free, flavored waters, coffee, tea, no-calorie sports drinks, and even low sodium broth.  Eating enough fruits and vegetables is key for a healthy lifestyle and diet since these foods are essential sources of vitamins, minerals and antioxidants. However, eating the recommended seven to nine servings of fruits and vegetables everyday may be daunting or difficult.If you're not a big fruit or vegetable eater, make a list of your top five favorite fruits and vegetables. Start by adding in just one serving of fruit or vegetables a day. As you get comfortable with this goal, add two servings a day. If you dislike a variety of fruits and vegetables, go to the grocery and pick out something new or unfamiliar to you. Or try an item that you haven't had in a while. Keep fresh fruit on the counter and vegetables cut, washed, and ready to eat in the fridge. The less preparation needed, the more likely you'll include them in your diet. If you enjoy a sweet after dinner, try having fruit with your dessert.  Whole grains are minimally processed grains that are higher in fiber, protein, and other nutrients compared to refined grains (like white bread or plain pasta).They also have a more nutty flavor and chewy texture which may not be enjoyable by all people.   If you typically eat mostly refined grains, start with making about half of your grain choices whole grains. As you get more comfortable with this goal, you can work up to making most or all of your grain choices whole grains. Whole grain foods to try include: 100% whole wheat pasta, oatmeal, quinoa, brown rice or 100% whole wheat bread. Try a variety of whole grains and a variety of brands of whole grains. For example, try 100% whole wheat pasta. If you don't like it, try another brand of 100% whole wheat pasta as each brand has a slightly different flavor.  Making lifestyle changes to be healthier doesn't mean you can't enjoy a snack. In fact, having a snack can help manage and control hunger and support weight loss.Healthy snacks should contain some lean protein and a fruit or a vegetable. However, start slowly changing your snacks for a lasting change. For example, if you normally have a small bag of chips in the afternoon try swapping to a small bag of whole grain chips with salsa.  Studies show that packing your lunch can help cut down on your overall calorie intake (and food costs).Brown-bagging your lunch will give you more control over what foods you eat and how they're prepared.   If you typically eat lunch out everyday, start by packing your lunch just one to two days a week. Also pack an afternoon snack if you typically stop by the vending machine to grab an afternoon pick-me-up.	Drink more water. Drink water before a meal. Eat a fruit and vegetable every day. Choose whole grains most of the time. Eat healthy snacks. Pack your lunch.
Therefore, some of the things you do to break in tap shoes might seem similar to these tips.; , This is to prevent a lot of blisters from coming. You are still going to get blisters, just not as much as you would without the Vaseline. , Just do maybe five to ten in a row. Sevens work too, if you would rather. These exercises will help increase the wideness of your hard shoe.  Make sure you rub at the sides and the front and backs.  Walk up and down the stairs about three to five times. Remember to walk at a very fast pace.  Once again, every Irish step dancer knows what this movement is. Repeatedly, do these exercises about ten to fifteen times.  You can leave it overnight. This will help make it easier to go en pointe.  You could do any one you want, as long as it will make your shoes feel "worn." This will probably give you blisters, but it's essential.  Once you are comfortable standing in three-quarters pointe (with just the balls of your feet on the ground), you should begin working towards a toe stand, if they are allowed for your age group. Begin by holding onto a surface at waist height such as a desk or a sturdy chair. Go into full pointe on one foot and pick the other up off the ground while using the desk for support. (It's okay if you have to bend your knee, but as your hard shoes become more broken in, try to straighten it more and more.) Meanwhile, repeatedly tap the heel of your standing foot with the toe of your standing foot. This will help give your shoe the flexibility you need to do a toe stand. Switch feet and do the same exercise on the other foot.	First things first, a hard shoe is like a tap dancing shoe, but it is a little more expensive and instead of metal it has fiber-glass or resin tips. Apply some Vaseline to the inside edge of your hard shoe where your heel will be. Walk around.Since your hard shoe is now on, walk up and down stairs, walk around the house, but do not walk outside, the concrete will ruin the leather sole.  , Start doing hop two threes.Every Irish step dancer know what a hop two three is. If your feet are starting to hurt, take a break and start rubbing the inside of your hard shoe. After rubbing, apply some more Vaseline, and put your hard shoes back on, because it is time to do more exercises. Hop, hop back, hop back two three four. Bend your hard shoe in half and put it under the couch. Once you have done everything here, try to dance. Toe stand practice.
You could grow them from seed yourself, but in all honesty, the tobacco seeds are almost microscopic and they are difficult to germinate successfully. Get some starter plants off eBay or something.; ,,, Place the plants in each row no less than two feet apart.  You may need to fertilize, but keep the chemicals to a minimum.  The flower is where seeds are produced and leaving the flower on the plant will stunt it's growth. You must remove the flower.   After about four months of growing, your plants should be mature.  You can stake them upside down in a traditional fashion and leave them to dry like that in the sun for a few days, but I did not. I washed mine and hung them upside down in my garage where it was about 80 degrees. I left them hanging for about two months until they turned golden brown.  The top leaves are supposedly the sweetest with the lower leaves being harsher. I discard the lowest row of leaves, but I believe this to be personal preference.  The leaves will be flaked once processed. The tobacco may or may not smell like the tobacco you are accustomed to buying from the store, but it is still tobacco and it smokes great.  You can expect to get about one half of a coffee container per plant.	Locate a nursery or person who grows tobacco plants from seed. Put your starter plants in cups with some good potting soil and leave them in the sun for a week or two, watering them daily/as needed until they have accepted their new environment.  , Till your garden.  , Plant the tobacco plants in rows where the rows are three feet apart. Water and maybe use some Miracle Grow and keep an eye on them as they take hold and grow. When the flower develops on the top of the plant, you need to cut it off. Cut them down. Be as selective as you like as to which leaves to pull from the plants. Once you've picked all of the dried leaves you wish to harvest, simply run them through a food processor. You can store your tobacco in leftover three pound coffee containers.
Select a location that is similar to where the plants would grow in the wild. For instance, primrose grows along banks and rocky ridges, while Columbine prefers the shade of trees.   The size of the growing area is entirely up to you. It is best if you can set it aside to grow wild once the seeds have been sown, so perhaps consider placing it away from areas of the garden, yard or land that are frequently tended, such as lawns and vegetable plots.; , When you grow a natural garden, it is best to select flowers that are local to your area.   Visit a local nature preserve to find out what types of wildflowers flourish in your area. Bring a notebook with you so you can write down names of flowers you enjoy, and note what flowers grow well together. Find information about natural gardening online, at the library, or at your local nursery store.  Purchasing wildflower seeds at a nursery, online or garden shop will ensure that you receive fertile and ready-to-grow seeds.  When you grow a natural garden, you need to get the soil ready for the seeds. Clear out the vegetation where you want to create your garden. Use a hoe. , When you grow a natural garden, it needs to have nourishing soil. , Then plant them in the other direction to ensure adequate coverage when you create a natural garden.  When you create a garden with wildflowers, you don't want the seeds planted too deep, because they may not develop.  This will help to stop birds eating them. After a good amount of growth has happened (around 2 to 5 months), you can lift up the netting and let it grow., The seeds should start sprouting within two weeks, and then you may need to water them occasionally, especially during the driest months of summer.  Mow the flower garden once after the flowers have seeded and just before spring. You should then have a patch full of color and habitat., Lift up a new area of turf next to the existing growing area and throw in additional wildflower seeds collected from the existing flowers. Doing this will ensure that the wildflowers spread and grow well.	Decide where to create a garden with wildflowers. Determine what types of wildflowers you want to plant. Obtain wildflower seeds. Prepare the soil. Till or rake the dirt about 1 inch (2.5 cm) deep.  , Mix in some potting soil with a hoe, to enrich the garden dirt.Plant your wildflower seeds in the spring when all danger of frost has passed. Sprinkle the seeds evenly in 1 direction. Press the seeds into the soil with a garden roller or gently walk on them with your feet, rather than burying the seeds. If needed, net off the place where you have sown the seeds. Water your wildflower seeds, being careful not to drown them. Mow the land area only after flowers have seeded. Start over the following spring.
It is designed to catch water that gets through the sunroof. Wipe it with a cloth to remove any visible debris on the seals and edges of the sunroof.; , These are very small holes, usually at the corners of the sunroof just under the seal.  These tubes are designed to carry water that gets through the roof down and out of the car. Tubes can get blocked with dirt and debris over time and need cleaning.	Clean the sunroof trough, located just inside the rubber seal. Locate the sunroof drain tubes. Blast compressed air through the drain tubes located at the base of the sunroof seal.
Just assume from now on that at the beginning of every dance, your right toe is pointed in front, your left foot is pointed outward, and your shoulders low and back, hands at your side.  Then, point your left foot and put it in back. When you "put it in back," put it in the same opening foot position -- closed and crossed.  That's a lifted knee on 1 (the right knee) and walking (on your toes) for 2,3,4,5,6, and 7. On 7, place your left foot solid on the ground.   When you lift your knee, really lift your knee and keep your toe pointed. The more exaggerated you feel, the better it probably looks.  This takes up an 8-count. Start again with your right foot, taking 4 counts. If you say it aloud, "point" is on 1, "back" is on 3, with silence on 4. For the left foot, point on 5, back on 7.  Again with the right knee, lift it high and place it down in front of your left foot. The "step in" serves as a ball change; when you place your right foot down on "step," shift your weight to your left foot on "in." When your weight is on your left, point your right foot forward and bring it back to conclude the step.   Once you get the basics down, make it "hoppy." There should be a livelihood to your points and knee lifts that makes it seem like you're sort of jumping. With every accented step, add a small hop on your back foot.	Assume the opening position. Point your right foot and put it in back. Lift your knee and walk in place for a seven. Point and put it in back once more for each leg. Lift up your knee, step in, and point in back to finish.
If you are the partner or principle guest of the mother, make sure you are ready to assist her during delivery with helpful tips, reminders, and encouragement.   A childbirth preparation class will teach you the stages of delivery, options for pain management, breathing techniques, assistance tips you can use as a guest during birth, and even what to bring with you to the delivery.  If you have been invited to attend the delivery of a child, it may help to learn how labor and delivery function.   Knowing the basics of what the mother is experiencing and how labor is expected to progress can help you calm the mother, prepare yourself for the sight of blood, and inform you of how long you can expect to be on your toes as a guest.  Many times, labor can begin hours before delivery occurs; as a guest, you may wish to think of strategies for keeping the mother pleasantly occupied during dilation.   Write down a list of things to discuss or safe activities to do while she is waiting to begin delivery. Suggestions include talking about future vacations, taking a walk, giving her a massage, listening to music, taking a bath (you may wish to pack a swimsuit), sitting on an exercise ball to relieve discomfort, watching the mother’s favorite movie on your laptop, and other low-stress activities to kill time and calm everyone’s nerves.	Consider attending a childbirth preparation class with the mother. Learn the biology of birth. Prepare ideas of what to do during the waiting period.
If water and mild detergent are not effective, you can use a pressure washer to remove tough stains from a stamped concrete surface. Pressure washing can help remove tire marks, leaf stains, and grease spots. Try renting a pressure washer at your local hardware store., An alkaline degreaser can help lift stains like oil and grease to the surface of stamped concrete. Use the degreaser with hot water. Make sure you follow all directions on the degreaser label., If your stamped concrete has a rust stain, you might be able to remove it using a cleaner with oxalic acid. Make sure you consult the company that installed or manufactured your stamped concrete before deciding to use oxalic acid.	Consider pressure washing outdoor surfaces. Try using an alkaline degreaser to remove oil, grease, or soot. Use oxalic acid to remove rust.
You need to know what's happening, so that you understand why your character is saying what you are saying. Do you have trouble with your character? Can you not read the lines clearly? Ask a friend for help.   Get into character. If you don't know what that means, it means to be the person/creature you're playing, walk, talk, look, like the part you're playing; then, you will make it more realistic.; , You should practice doing it as it would be done in real life, on stage or in a studio. In the performance it won't be done in your head.   Ask a family member or a friend to help you learn them, reading along with what you are saying and to catch skipped or wrong emphasis on words.  If you know your lines -- but you don't know when to say them -- you're going to struggle. Know the last bit of the previous person's lines or the events leading to yours; so that you know when to say your lines.  It will make it more realistic, and it will also help you with your performance skills.  Take a few lines at a time. One time you can look at one scene, and then split the scene up into groups of lines. Learn a few lines at a time and keep going over them -- even if you know them. Going over them again will make you feel confident.  If you see a big speech, split that into smaller parts and you will be able to learn it. It might be really cool if you have a lot of lines, just make sure you learn them all, to do them with real feeling.  Acting is work, but it can also be a lot of fun. If you enjoy doing it, you will be able to excel in it a lot easier. You will be able to learn the lines easier if you are enjoying it, otherwise, you will be bored and not able to concentrate on it for long.  It is very important that you take a breaks, preferably after a set amount of time. The amount of time you can work before having a break will vary with the individual, but it doesn't matter whether other people can work longer than you. Everyone is different!  , Always have a drink of water with you. It will really help you concentrate if you have a drink of water. Also, it may help if you have sweets or candy with you. If you get stressed, then stop for a minute, have some sweets and continue.  When you are walking or driving somewhere you have to go to anyway, practice some lines. Incorporate the practice in your daily routine. Practice in front of the mirror. Look at yourself. Find out which expression works best with your character. Have your lines close to be able to quickly glance over them for help.  This step should be practiced at least five weeks before the performance. Have your friend or friends read certain parts as you try to remember you lines to respond. Don't use your playbook for this step.  Use wardrobe and put makeup on for this step.	Read the play and understand it. Walk around a room while you are saying the lines out loud. Know your cues. Perform your parts of the play while you are learning your lines. Split it up. Don't be overwhelmed at the amount of lines you need to learn. Have fun. Take breaks. Drink plenty of water. Say the lines to yourself during your daily routine. Use a friend to help you. Make a schedule with the rest of the cast to practice.
Keep watering until water leaks out through the drain hole at the bottom of the pot.You shouldn't have to water your herbs more than once or twice a week.If you water too often, the soil will become waterlogged. This can lead to root rot, which can kill your herbs.  Every herb is different, so you might want to read the seed packet, or the label that came with your herb. In general, however, most types of herbs need 6 to 8 hours of sunlight each day.A bright, sunny window would be ideal. If you live in a place that gets very little sunlight, consider getting a UV lamp for your herbs.   Consider rotating the pots every 4 to 5 days. This will help the herbs grow straight up, instead of bent to the side., Water, sunlight, and potting soil are not enough to grow healthy herbs. You will need to fertilize them every once in a while. When buying a fertilizer, make sure that you get something that promotes healthy leaves instead of pretty flowers. After all, you eat the leaves of herbs, and not their flowers., This will help them produce more leaves. When harvesting, make sure that you leave a few inches of stem on the plant. This will allow the plant to continue to grow. You also want to avoid taking the large leaves. These leaves capture the most sunlight, and aid the plant with photosynthesis.Many herbs will produce flowers. You will want to pinch these off, so that the herb can focus on producing tasty leaves rather than pretty blooms.The one exception to this is chamomile; the flower itself is the herb. Pick leafy herbs, such as basil, right at the top of the stem.Snip delicate herbs, such as cilantro and parsley, closer to the base of the stem.Trim woody herbs, such as rosemary, with scissors or garden shears.	Water only when the top layer of the soil is dry. Make sure that your herbs get enough sunlight. Don't forget to feed your herbs. Remember to prune and harvest your herbs.
You will need 1¾ yards (1.6 meters) of fleece fabric, about 44 to 45 inches (1.2 meters) wide. Plaid patterns work best with this, but a solid color will also look nice.Make sure that you are using flannel and not fleece. Fleece does not fray the same way flannel does. For a larger blanket, opt for a 2-yard (1.8-meter) piece of fabric instead.; , This blanket will only have a fringe on the narrow edges. The long edges will be left alone for a finished look. Take a look at the long edges of your fabric, and trim off any stray threads. You won't be hemming them because the salvage already takes care of that.If you want to have a fringe on all four sides, cut the selvage edges off., Choose a thread color that matches your fabric, and sew across the narrow sides, 1-inch (2.54-centimeters) from the edge. Use a short stitch length. This will keep the fabric from fraying past the fringe.If you want to have a fringe on all four sides, sew around the blanket using a 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) seam allowance. Turn the fabric at the corners so that you sew in one continuous line.If you want a longer fringe, leave a larger seam allowance.  Cut the slits from the narrow edges of the fabric so that they are aligned with the selvage edge. This will make the proceeding steps easier.Be careful not to cut through your stitching!   If you want your blanket to have a fringe on all four sides, cut a 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) square into each of the corners. Be careful not to cut through your stitching. This will make it easier to pull the threads out. If you want to make a longer fringe, cut longer slits/bigger squares.  Be careful not the pull the actual stitching threads out, however. You are only pulling the threads that make up the fabric out. The easiest way to do this would be to grab a thread or two with a seam ripper and then pulling it out. Keep doing this until you reach the stitching you made.   Be sure to pull the threads out from the notch you cut into the selvage edge. Do not fray the rest of the selvage. Run your fingers through the fringe when you are done. This will loosen up the fringe and get rid of any residual fuzz.	Choose your fabric. Clean the selvage edges up. Sew across the narrow edges of your blanket. Cut 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) slits into the selvage edges. Pull the threads out of the fabric until you reach your stitching.
Cook with citrus in the spring, berries in summer and apples and pumpkin in the fall. Food prepared at the peak of its freshness has unbeatable flavor and nutritional value.; , Instead, choose healthy ways to enhance the flavor of fruit in your cooking. For example, serve baked apples with frozen yogurt, cinnamon, walnuts and dried cranberries; or add balsamic vinegar to strawberries to bring out their natural sweetness.  Fruit juice and dried fruit, when used in moderation, is a healthy addition to many meals. Cook a dish like Moroccan chicken with dried plums to boost the fiber content of the dish, or use freshly squeezed orange juice to give a citrus kick to a salad dressing.  Applesauce is a great substitute for vegetable oil in muffin and bread recipes. You’ll have to do some research to calculate just how much fat you can replace with fruit in your recipes, but the fruit can add the same moisture to your dishes without making your fingers greasy, so it’s worth it.	Use fresh, local fruit that is in season. Avoid adding table sugar to fruit dishes. Don’t forget juices and dried fruits. Use fruit purees in place of fat when baking.
In order to lengthen the life of your cut flowers, you need to make sure that the container you keep them in is as clean as possible and free from any bacteria that might kill off your flowers early. Usually, scrubbing the vase with warm water and mild detergent is adequate, but if you know that previous flowers in the vase had a disease or if the vase looks especially dirty, use bleach. Scrub the inside using a bottle brush and follow by soaking it.   If your vase is dishwasher safe, you can also run it on a normal dishwashing cycle. You should verify that the vase can withstand such hot water before attempting it, however.; , Your garden shears will be the first surface to come into contact with the delicate interior of the freshly cut stems, making it essential that they are clean and free from harmful bacteria. Wipe the blades using a rag soaked in a little bleach or alcohol. Rinse the sterilized blades under hot water.  Roses last longest when they are cut immediately after the bud stage, when the petals are starting to open. Rose varieties with many petals, such as the Moonstone variety, should be cut at a more open stage, while rose varieties with fewer petals, like the Silverado, should be cut closer to the bud stage.  Then, that night, give the rose bush a thorough watering, drenching the soil completely so that the roses have plenty to drink. The more water your roses absorb by the following morning, the longer the roses will last after being cut.  Anytime from daybreak to 10:00 AM should work, but after that point, the weather begins heating up too much. Hot, sunny weather deprives your roses of substance, drying them out and making them weaker. On especially hot days, you should make it a point to cut your roses as early as possible.   Alternatively, you can also cut your roses in the evening. If the roses are watered in the morning or if they receive a great deal of morning dew, cutting them in the evening, after the weather has cooled and the roses have had a chance to recover, can also work sufficiently well.  Using your clean shears, cut the rose stems at roughly a 45 degree angle. Cutting the roses at an angle prevents the stems from resting flat in the vase, which could prevent them from drinking all the water they need, resulting in an early death. Cut the stems low to the ground, leaving plenty of stem to work with for you to resize appropriately later on.  This does not need to be your vase. Instead, you should use a bucket with a large enough opening for you to work inside. All further cutting should be done inside this bucket of water to prevent air bubbles or embolisms from emerging inside the stems.  Bacteria and rot can fester in leaves the sit in still water. You still need to leave the foliage above the water line, approximately the top half to the top third, intact. Otherwise, the roses will be unable to draw up water.  Make an angled cut underwater, similar the first. This cut will determine the final length of the stems and the final height of your roses. Temporarily remove the flowers from your bucket of water and measure them against the side of the vase to determine where to make the necessary cut. Once you have chosen the spot, return the flowers to the bucket and cut them beneath the water.  Use warm water. You can either use commercial rose food or make your own plant food by using 1 Tbsp (15 ml) vinegar, 1 tsp (5 ml) sugar, and 3 to 5 drops of household bleach per 1 liter (1 quart) of water.Bleach is especially useful in preventing harmful bacteria from attacking the freshly cut roses. Thoroughly dissolve the plant food before adding the roses.  Transfer the roses into your vase and sit the vase in a cool, dark room so that the water can thoroughly nourish the roses. Do not allow the blooms to get wet, however.  The roses must chill at approximately 38 degrees Fahrenheit (3 degrees Celsius) for at least two hours or until you are ready to gift them or display them.  If possible, change the water daily to rid the roses' environment of bacteria. Frequently changed fresh water will help make the roses last longer.   Avoid using softened water that contains salt since salt can hurt your roses.	Clean the vase you plan to put the roses in. Clean the shears. Choose the right roses. Water the roses.If possible, make sure you know which morning you will cut your roses on the night before. Cut the roses in the early morning. Cut the roses to remove them from the bush. Move the cut roses to a bucket of warm water. Cut off leaves below the water line. Make a second cut. Fill your vase with water and plant food. Allow the roses to sit in the conditioned water for one hour. Transfer the roses into the refrigerator. Change the water frequently.
Standing outside of the shower area, take a hair brush and go through your hair a few times. Gather any loose hairs in your hands and throw them away before stepping into the shower. This will minimize the number of hairs that may fall out and clog your drain., If you wash your dog or cat in the bath, then give them a good brush down elsewhere beforehand. Try to get off the matted areas and any clumps of loose hair before putting them under the water. In addition, if your dog is muddy, try to remove any larger chunks of dirt before bathing.To minimize the strain on your drain, when the weather is warm you might want to bathe your pets outside instead, if possible.  As you run your hands through your wet hair, place the hair strands that end up on your hands on the wall or the shower ledge. This is better than letting them go on down the drain. When you step out of the shower or bath, wipe up these hairs with your hands or a paper towel and toss them in the trash.Make sure to gather up the hairs after every shower or bath or you could end up creating a hairball that could lodge in your drain.  Debris, such as make-up pieces or clumps of dirt, can partially block the drain. When combined with hairs, this can then develop into a full clog. Be extra careful when putting on your make-up above the bathroom sink, for example. Placing extra screens on all drains can help to minimize these seemingly random clogs., Always let the water run for an extra minute or so after you step out of the shower or bath. This flushes any debris further down the pipes and helps to prevent a clog close to the drain. It is also a good idea to flush your bathroom sink with water as well since toothpaste and other products can clog the pipes otherwise.	Brush your hair beforehand. Remove any excess dirt from pets before washing. Gather any loose hair mid-showering. Avoid putting foreign objects in the drain. Run the water after finishing.
Hold the spray paint can at least one to two inches (2.5-5cm) away from the carpet for consistent coverage without over-painting.   Avoid shaking the can over the area you want to paint to prevent the paint from splashing or splattering.       Run the paint over the carpet in a smooth, even fashion. If the first pass is too light, repeat the step until you're satisfied with the coverage.       Dab any puddled paint on painter’s tape with a rag. You don’t want to have puddled tape dry on the tape as when you peel it away it could not only stick to the carpet, some paint could not be fully dry and spill on other areas of the carpet.  Make sure you are fully satisfied with the section you are painting before moving forward.  This may take some time, but doing it the right way will be worth the wait.   Be sure you lay painter's tape on fully dried paint. During the second or third phase of the painting, you may be laying painter’s tape on previously painted area. Never place tape on a painted area unless completely dry or you risk compromising the integrity of the previously painted area.  Typical dry time is anywhere from eight to 10 hours depending upon the climate and humidity levels.	Paint the carpet. Work from one end of the carpet to the other end. Allow the paint to dry before adding a new color to your design. Wait until the rug is completely dry before using.
Replace your right-hand needle with a similarly-sized crochet hook. This method is very similar to the standard cast-off, but many people find working with a crochet hook faster and easier. Additionally, this method requires no additional yarn other than a short tail, in case you misjudged length or are otherwise in a bind. , Slide the hook underneath the first two loops on the needle. Remove them from the needle onto your crochet hook. Slide the hoops down so that they rest on the straight part of the tool rather than the hook itself.  With either your fingers or knitting tools, carefully take the second loop and bring it up over the first. Remove the second stitch from the crochet hook while leaving the first.  You should now have two loops on the hook. Repeat the previous step with these two stitches. Continue this process with each loop that remains on your needle. Pull the small tail of yarn through the last stitch to finish.	Finish your entire project, including the last row. Pick up two stitches with the crochet hook. Pull the second stitch over the first. Transfer the next stitch from the needle to the crochet hook.
How long the wires are will depend on how big you want your cloud to be. You will be folding these wires into a ring, so keep this in mind. Make sure that all of the wires are the same length.; , Take your first wire, and overlap the two ends by 1 inch (2.54 centimeters). Twist the ends to hold the ring together. Repeat this step for the other wires.  Hold one right horizontally. Hold the other ring above it, vertically. Slight the vertical ring into the horizontal one halfway. Your two rings will make a cross.  You can do this by putting beads of hot glue on the joints between the two rings. You can also tie the joints together with some more wire. Be sure to tuck any sharp ends into the wire "orb."  , Slip the third ring over your frame at a left angle. Secure it to the joints between the other rings with hot glue or more wire. Repeat this step with the fourth ring, but insert it at a right angle. These two new rings should form an X.  Pull off a long strip of polyester stuffing. Draw a squiggle of hot glue across it, then wrap it over your frame. Make sure that it covers at least two rings.   Work quickly. Hot glue sets fast.  Keep doing this until most of your frame is covered. Be careful not to wrap the frame too tightly, or your will distort it.  Once you have most of your cloud covered, pull out smaller tufts of polyester. Draw a swirl of hot glue, then press it against the cloud.  If your cloud looks too much like a ball, gently pull here and there on the tufts to bring them out. This will make your orb look more lumpy and cloud–like than like cotton candy. Don't pull too much, however, of the polyester stuffing won't hold together.  Cut a long piece of fishing line. Dig through your cloud until you find a joint between two wire rings. Tie the fishing line to the joint.  Get some tape and tape your hanging cloud to the ceiling. For a stronger hold, screw a ceiling hook into your ceiling. Tie a loop into the end of the fishing line. Slip the loop over the ceiling hook.	Cut four strands of wire with wire cutters. Twist the wires into rings. Tuck the first ring into the second one, crosswise. Secure the cross. Add the other two rings to form an X and complete your frame. Hot glue polyester stuffing to the wire frame. Continue hot gluing polyester stuffing to the frame. Fill in the gaps with smaller tufts of polyester stuffing. Fluff the cloud out. Tie a piece of fishing line to your cloud. Attach the cloud to the ceiling. Finished.
Not only will you learn a lot about the craft, but you will also make connections with others that are interested in making movies. You may even be able to find work on a film crew through your classmates or professors.Many community colleges offer courses in film that you could sign up for if you aren’t ready to enroll in film school.; , People on film crews sometimes have varied backgrounds, such as in writing, theatre, or art. Consider taking classes in these subjects to broaden your knowledge and prepare you for becoming a filmmaker.  You should watch a variety of movies to get ideas and tips for your own film. Choose movies from different genres and different eras. Pay attention to details such as:What do you like about a film? What makes a movie believable? What makes a strong character? How are props used successfully? How does the location impact or enhance the film?  , It is important to keep your knowledge current regarding the market. Find out news and trends about the film industry so that you know what you’re up against., Meeting other people in the industry can help you out tremendously. Follow leaders in the filmmaking biz on social media, and attend filmmaking and movie events as often as you can., Speak to someone who has experience with filmmaking. Ask them what tips or tricks they have for you. Ask to tag along when they shoot one of their own movies so you can see firsthand what works and what doesn’t.You may be able to find a mentor in film school. Ask a classmate who has experience or one of your professors to mentor you. Alternatively, once you gain experience on a film crew, you may be able to find a mentor through your work.  In order to gain experience in the industry, you should work on a film crew. Search online for job openings near you, and ask your classmates and professors if they know of any crews seeking help.  The producer can help choose other members for the film crew as well as cast the roles for the movie. This person manages the production from start to finish. They are the group leader and the one who develops the project. You will likely need education as well as experience to qualify for a producer role, but as a beginner you can likely be a production assistant., The director is responsible for overseeing the the shooting and assembly of the film. They work closely with all the other members of the team to ensure everyone is on track., This team writes the script for the film. They must make sure that the content is interesting and follows a logical sequence. They write dialogue for the actors as well as ensure the transitions from one scene to the next make sense., A camera person films the movie. They should have prior experience using a video camera, and be able to film from different angles. Some films require multiple camera people to shoot the film from various angles., The gaffer is in charge of lighting for the movie. They are also the head electrician and are in charge of ensuring there is adequate power on the set and that all cables and cords are properly placed.Crews often also have boom operators to man the microphones, so if you are interested in ensuring the sound for the film is top-notch, become a boom operator.  Actors star in the film, so you should have acting experience for this job. It is important that actors are able to become the person they are portraying, no matter how different the character is from the actor's personality., Technical producers work hard after the filming is completed. They are in charge of choosing which shots to use, editing the film for content, as well as adding special effects and music when necessary., At the very least, you will need a camera. Don’t worry about purchasing one that is top of the line, but instead choose something of good quality at an affordable price. You’ll have plenty of time to upgrade in the future.   If your camera doesn’t have a good microphone, you may also want to purchase boom mics so that the actors’ voices come through loud and clear.  Choose an idea for your first film based on something you are both passionate and knowledgeable about. Get inspiration from the real world, even if your film will be sci-fi or fantasy. The audience should still be able to relate to the issues and connect to the characters.   Focus on content. What’s in your film is more important than the equipment you shoot your film with. Remember to keep your focus on the content of the film and create a story that other people want to see and can identify with., Making a film takes an entire crew to keep things running smoothly. Select people to fill the roles that you cannot, such as producer, director, scriptwriter, camera operator, gaffer, boom operator, costume coordinator, art director, technical producer, and actors.   If you’ve taken film classes, see if any of your classmates are interested in joining your film crew. You can also post notices at school or online to find people willing to become part of the crew.  Pick a nice day when your crew can arrive at the set location. Spend time working with your actors to ensure they deliver their lines correctly and show appropriate emotion.Take your time; your film will be stronger if you aren’t rushing. You may need to film a scene several times to get it right.  Go through each scene to find the best shots. Add music and sound effects to the film. Pay close attention to the details to ensure the film is the best it can be. Make sure transitions are seamless and that there are no errors in your film, such as an actor drinking lemonade for part of one scene and Kool-Aid for another part of the same scene.  This is the most important step because if you do not have fun, it will come across in your film. Laugh at your bloopers, and take breaks if you need them. Remember why you are filming in the first place: you love making movies. Do it for the fun, not the fame.  Distribute your film in every way you can. Post it online, to your social media accounts, YouTube, and Vimeo. You should also try to show your film to people in person. Sign up for screening contests or set up a showing of your film in your hometown.	Take a film class or enroll in film school. Study a related field. Research films. Find out what’s going on in the industry. Network. Find a mentor. Join a film crew. Sign up as an assistant producer to learn how a production works. Assist the director if you want to be at the center of film production. Join the script-writing team if you want to tell a story. Work the camera if you are interested in cinematography. Become a gaffer if you have electrical experience. Try your hand at acting if you want to be on screen. Join the technical production team to affect the appearance of the film. Get the proper equipment. Come up with an idea for a short film. Choose your film crew. Start shooting. Edit your film. Have fun. Market your film.
Using condiments to clean coins might seem ridiculous, but this really works. Get ketchup and squirt it all over a plate. Completely cover the area if you have a lot of pennies, or layer it smoothly if you just have a few.; , Any more than this will result in the job not being properly done. So grab 10 of them and lay them down, spread out flat, on the plate.  Yes, smush. Smush the pennies down into the ketchup, and let them soak in. Jiggle them around a little if necessary.  Use a Q-tip to swab up some ketchup from the side of the plate and spread it on the top of your pennies. Again smush, and continue to spread and smooth.  Use 2 Q-tips to flip each penny over, and spread more over the tops again. Let the pennies soak. Smush, spread, let soak. Smush, spread, let soak.  No, you don't have to reach in the goopy red mess with your bare hands and dig the pennies out. Use a spoon to scoop them out.  By this time, your pennies are going to look even uglier than they did before, with all the ketchup on them. Put them in a bowl and run them under the sink (water temperature doesn't matter). Then pour it out, being careful to hold your hand over the bowl so the money stays inside. Then run water over the pennies once more to ensure cleanliness. ,	Grab some ketchup. Get your pennies in groups of 10. Smush. Spread. Flip. Take them out. Wash them off. Watch your coins sparkle!  , Finished.
Submitting a casting reel can boost your chances at getting on the show. While this is typically done if you can’t attend an open casting call, you also submit a video in addition to attending a casting call if you’re really determined.Your reel shouldn’t be extremely long, but long enough to showcase your “bad girl” attitude.   Introduce yourself and explain why you’d be an excellent cast member. Don’t tell them why you think you’re a bad girl, tell them why you ARE a bad girl. You can film a video just speaking to the camera, or you can enlist a friend or family member to film a more active video, following you around.  Even though Bad Girls Club is reality TV, at the end of the day, it is still a story. Embrace the character you think you’d play on the show. If you’re an aggressive woman dealing with anger issues, highlight that. If you’re a sweetheart with a wild side, show that off. Additionally, highlight the interesting things in your past that have made you a bad girl today. Make sure that your online form, your presence at the casting calls, and your optional filmed reel all create a cohesive image of who you are.   Personal tragedy might not be fun to talk about, but it can make you a fascinating and relatable television personality. Open up about any heartbreak in your life. Reveal anything about yourself that you think no one else can say. Casting directors will get thousands of videos, so make sure yours stands out.  Don’t hurt your chances by second-guessing, doubting, or censoring yourself. Give yourself a pep talk before you begin your auditioning process, and remind yourself that you’re an interesting, strong, entertaining person. If you aren’t confident in who you are, and if you can’t hold your own in a room filled with outspoken women, you’ll probably be overlooked by the Bad Girls Club casting directors.   Fake it ‘til you make it. Even if you feel shy and unsure of yourself, mimic someone you know who is uninhibited, candid, and strong-willed. Soon, these traits can rub off on you and it won’t be “fake” anymore.	Film a reel. Embrace your “character” and back story. Hold nothing back.
Take your sashay yarn and unfurl it so that it looks like a wide flat piece of ribbon. Then, find the loops at the top of the yarn. These will look like small rectangular spaces large enough to easily put your hook through. Count five of these loops and then fold you’re your yarn., With the folded over piece of yarn behind your working yarn, insert your hook through the first loop.For these first few stitches, you will be working through the folded over yarn as well, so you will really be going through two loops.  After getting the first two loops on your hook, skip over the next loop and then insert the hook through the one after that (make sure to get the front and back loop) and chain one.Repeat this four times. To chain with sashay yarn, insert the hook through a loop and then through another. Then, pull the second loop through the first loop on your hook., After you finish four stitches, turn your work and then begin working single crochet stitches into the loops. Do your first single crochet stitch in the first chain stitch in your row.Single crochet every other stitch to the end of your row. To single crochet with sashay yarn, insert the crochet hook into the first stitch and then through a loop on your working yarn. Pull the loop through the first stitch. Then, insert the hook through another loop in your working yarn and pull through both of the other loops on your hook.Continue to turn and single crochet across every row until your scarf is the desired length. You can make a ruffle scarf with just one ball of sashay yarn, but you may make it longer if you prefer.  Once you reach the end of the scarf, cut the yarn, leaving a 6-inch (15.25-cm) tail.   Tuck this tail end in between the nearest two ruffles. Use a sewing needle and thread to tack the end in place, securing it and preventing the scarf from unraveling. This completes your ruffle scarf.	Fold over the first five loops of the yarn. Insert your hook through the first loop. Skip a loop and chain one. Turn your work and single crochet into first stitch. Trim the yarn.
The amplifier will need to be turned up fairly loud in order for this to work, so you should protect your ears from potentially harmful sound levels. A good pair of earplugs might be sufficient, but for very loud volumes, specialty sound dampening ear protectors might be best. , Plug in and switch on your amp. You should hear a faint tone caused by the electricity running through it. This means your amp is ready for input. Take the cord end of your mic and plug its audio jack into your amp.   You’ll also need to plug a microphone into your amplifier. You should place your mic as far away from the amplifier as the cable will allow to prevent distortion and mic feedback. Use a microphone stand if you have one available. Singing hands free will allow you to focus more intensely on the task at hand. Remember to wear your ear protection. Also, to minimize your exposure to loud volumes, you should stand behind the amp, or behind it and off to the side. If your mic doesn’t work, check it for an on/off switch. If your mic is already switched on but still is not working, check the audio jack to make sure your it is fully connected to the speaker.  If you are using an unfamiliar amp, test its volume at a medium level before attempting to put it on the maximum setting. Most glasses will require you to reach a minimum of 100 to 110 decibels, which is about the volume of a passing motorbike, a nearby car horn, or the music in a nightclub.You may want to layer the wall your amp is pointed at with sound dampening material, like heavy blankets or cushions. This will prevent the loudness of your amp from aggravating others. Other sound dampening measures you might make use of include acoustic panels, soundproof curtains, and other techniques.  You’ll want to save your voice from unnecessary strain by singing at a soft to moderate volume. Slide your voice in very small increments around the resonant pitch until you feel confident that you have it perfectly. Then increase your volume until you are singing into the microphone directly at a moderate volume.   If your glass refuses to break, check your pitch with a pitch finder. The pitch you are singing might only be off a slight bit, but this can prevent your glass from breaking. Vowels are less obstructed and will help you to achieve louder volumes. In particular, the "ee" vowel sound has the highest volume rating. The vowel “ay” is also rated very highly for volume. Sustain your note as long as possible while making slight adjustments. Even if you hit the resonant frequency dead-on, you’ll have to hold the pitch perfectly for a few seconds before the glass vibrates enough to shatter.Since you are using amplification, you shouldn’t need to shout into the microphone. Speaking loudly puts strain on your voice and can do permanent damage if you’re not careful. Sing into the microphone at a moderate volume and take a break whenever your voice feels tired., A pair of rubber gloves will help prevent you from getting any nicks or cuts from the glass while cleaning. You may want to use a flashlight to help you find difficult to see fragments. Pick up and throw away large pieces of glass with your hands, sweep up smaller fragments, and use care when vacuuming. Glass fragments may cause damage to your vacuum cleaner.A common trick for picking up small shard and slivers of glass uses a slice of soft sandwich bread. Press your bread into the floor wherever you see glass. The glass should get caught into the bread, which you can throw away when the glass is clean or the piece of bread is full of glass. You may need to use several pieces of bread to clean the entire area.	Protect your hearing. Prepare your amplifier. Adjust the volume of your amp. Sing into the microphone. Dispose of the broken glass carefully.
If you do not want the look of an elastic waistband, you can sew a small strip of elastic into the back of your pants. This will help to cinch in your waistband in a less noticeable way. Cut a 1 ½ centimeter (½ inch) wide strip of elastic about 15 centimeters (6 inches) long.The length of elastic will vary depending on the size of your waistband. For example, the elastic should reach about half way between the center belt loop and the side belt loop of your pants.  Turn your pants inside out and center the elastic along the waistband at the back of your pants. To hold the elastic in place, pin it to the pants. Place a pin on either side of the center belt loop, to mark where the belt loop is located.  Begin near the center of the elastic, on one side of the center belt loop, and use a zigzag stitch. Sew through the center of the elastic until you reach the end. In order to sew a zigzag stitch, select the zigzag stitch on your sewing machine. As you sew, pull the elastic tight and let the material of the pants feed through the machine normally.Then repeat the sewing process, starting on the other side of the center belt loop and sew outwards towards the other side of the elastic. Remove the pins as you are sewing. Do not sew over a pin because this could break your needle. Use a thread that matches the color of the pants.	Cut a small strip of elastic. Center the elastic in the back of your pants. Sew the elastic onto the waistband.
The floor is likely to get a little dirty, so thoroughly cover the floor with newspaper. Don't do this on carpet or other floors that should be protected, unless you've lined the floor with plastic.       ; , Place it in the middle of the newspaper-covered area. , This works best if you hold the blade of the screwdriver sideways against the outer portions of the cog and gently turn the cranks. Try to avoid allowing the scraped-off dried mud and dirt to land on the chain.  Dampen it. Provided that you are working in a well-ventilated area, you might like to add a degreasing cleaner, such as lighter fuel or a citrus degreaser. (See "Tips", however.)         , Hold on tightly. Turn the cranks a couple of times while holding the rag around the chain firmly. This works best if you hold the upper portion of the chain, the one that's closest to the saddle (seat). You will notice that the chain becomes much cleaner.           Mark one link with a magic marker, sticker or a piece of tape, so that you know where you started. Starting with the marked link, apply one drop of chain lube to each link. It's best to apply a little drop to each gap where two links overlap. Don't use too much or it will be wasted because you'll wipe off the excess lube anyway!  , When you've lubed all the links, turn the cranks again for half a minute or so to make sure that the lube settles properly into the inside of the link. ,	Lubricate your bicycle in the garage or outdoors. Turn the bike upside down. Familiarize yourself with the parts that touch the chain:          front chain wheels possibly a front derailleur (the part that changes gears in front) rear cogs possibly a rear derailleur with two more cogs.  , Scrape off any mud and dirt from the cogs on the rear derailleur. Prepare the rag. Take the rag in your palm and wrap it around the chain. Lubricate the chain. Allow the lube to settle. Remove any excess lube on the outside of the chain using the rag.         , Clean up.
No matter what bridge you might have, you may be able to set it just about where Ibanez has theirs. Examine an authentic Ibanez and experience the feel and sound of their guitar, paying special attention to where the bridge is set. Then mimic that setting on your own guitar, putting your bridge where it feels most similar to the Ibanez. If you want to, use a guide with a straight edge so it lays almost or is flat across the strings on floating bridges. Make sure not to set the bridge too far away from where it was originally, or you won't be able to play at all.  After raising or lowering the bridge, your strings will be out of tune. Using a tuner, tune your strings until they are fully tuned in E-A-D-G-B-E configuration. Tune them to your preference and make sure they sound right and hit the right notes. Don't worry about buzzing just yet, though.  Buzzing is a major problem when strings are set very low, and most of the buzz comes from the lower strings. To stop this, try using a different gauge of strings. You may think that using thicker strings is counterproductive, but in fact they will be more tensioned when tuned and they will buzz less and will stay in tune longer. Still, thicker strings are not always the best way to fix buzzing. Depending on precisely when and where the buzzing occurs, your diagnosis (and the solution) might be slightly different, so check to make sure all the nuts and frets are in place and secure, then figure out when and where the buzzing occurs before you proceed., Ensure that they are glued down properly. If this doesn't fix the buzzing, you may have to change the nut height. Ibanez guitars straight from the factory are set up either on a slight incline towards the nut or just flat across. If yours are not right, try adjusting them.   To remove the nut, use a sharp blade that is designed specifically for cutting, such as a box cutter or X-acto knife, to cut away the finish. Cut in front, behind, and at the sides, then, gently tap the nut out of its placement. Replace the nut. After the nut is out, replace any wood that came out and then dry fit the new nut. Almost every single nut is imperfect and will require a sanding to make it fit. The best guitar nut to replace the old one is a roller nut, but many are not adjustable, so find one at size or simply add wood underneath to raise the nut. To glue it in place, use wood glue mixed with water, because you may soon need to replace it again.  If you still can't get that Ibanez feel, then try replacing your frets with something different. However, buying an Ibanez is cheaper than having someone redo your frets, and unless you know what you're doing, trying to do them on your own could destroy your neck. If you think this is necessary in order to make your guitar feel like an Ibanez, it may not be worth the expense and risk, so think carefully before taking this step.  After getting everything to feel just right to you, tune or restring your guitar and play, making small adjustments as necessary. Many adjustments will probably be needed to the way you play, so play and correct your action until the result is satisfactory to you.	Set your action. Tune your strings. Set the strings to prevent buzzing. Check the guitar nut. Check out your frets. Tune and restring the guitar.
Moss roses are well-known for their combination of beauty and durability. They suit most climates well, and amply reward their caretakers with amazing blooms. However, they do have a few quirks, so double-check to make sure your garden can support them.   Moss roses are succulents, storing water in large, fleshy leaves. This means that they will be fine if you forget to water them.They can grow in poor soil or even rock gardens.However, they might drown in a very rainy climate. Moss roses are low-lying, rarely topping six inches in height. They are good for borders and pots, but do not command large-scale attention on their own.Moss roses can absorb the carbon dioxide from car exhaust especially efficiently. This means that they are sometimes used to line driveways, or parking lots.Though some varieties of their seeds are edible to humans, moss roses are toxic to pets. Do not plant them where a dog or cat can snack on them.; , Now that you know you’re ready for moss roses, it’s time to figure out where to put them. Since moss roses love sun, make sure they will get full sunlight for at least part of the day. If you are planning to use them in a flower display, plan to put them in front, as portulaca plants are low-lying.   To know how many moss rose plants you need for a border, measure the length in yards or meters, then divide by three--that’s the number of roses you need to fill the border with plenty of space between the young plants. Don’t worry; moss roses grow fast, so you won’t have gaps for long.You don’t have to plant moss roses outside. They are pretty in pots, too, as long as they get plenty of sunlight., If you are a more confident gardener, you may already be planning to work with seeds. If you would prefer to begin your garden with a little bit of a head start, seedlings may work for you. There are pros and cons to each, so think about it and decide which suits you better.Seeds are cheaper, and you can start growing them (indoors or outdoors) whenever you’re ready. However, it can be difficult to wait two weeks for them to germinate, and then an additional month until they're sturdy enough to move. Seedlings are convenient and already healthy, but because a greenhouse has done the work of germination for you, they are often expensive.  You can buy moss rose seedlings at any local greenhouse, since they are popular summer plants, though they may be tricky to find in grocery stores. Seeds can also be found in greenhouses or garden supply stores, or well-reviewed online shops.  If you're using seeds and experiencing a long winter, you should start growing inside. This will keep the seedlings warm and protected until you’re ready to plant them outdoors. Your specific seed variety will probably have instructions, but in general, moss roses grow in similar ways.   Place seeds uncovered on shallow dry soil (a few inches deep is fine) and keep at room temperature.You can sprinkle them with a little water every few days, but they don’t need much. The seeds should germinate within two weeks, but wait an additional month before you move them., Moss roses are used to balmy summer climates. As hardy as they are with little water, a cold snap can easily kill them.Keep seedlings inside until you’re certain the ground won’t freeze. Treat them as you would if they were outside--make sure they get full sun and a sprinkle of water every now and then.  Once the frost is gone for good, it’s time to plant your seeds or seedlings outside. Make sure to space them out (12 inches, or .3 meters, is great) and cover them with minimal soil. They should be thriving in no time.   If you live in a warm area, you can plant seeds directly--just scatter them on the ground and cover with a little seeding soil.If you’re transplanting home-grown or commercial seedlings into the warmed ground, dig a small hole the size of the container the seedlings are in, then lift up the plant by its base and place it into the hole., Plan to baby your moss roses for their first few days outside. For about a week, water them on a daily basis, since the roots have not yet expanded to fill the full area needed to get water to the whole plant.After this first week, you can water them less frequently.  You should try to mimic desert rain habits by watering the plants thoroughly, and letting them dry out before watering them again. Watering them about once a week will usually work well. Make sure they don’t experience too much runoff from other plants that need more water.  Not only would it be a tragedy to lose the flowers, but they could poison the animals you know. You probably already planted the seeds where they couldn’t be reached by your own pets--make sure to prevent other pets in the neighborhood from running amok through your garden, too., This is one of the few tasks you will have to do for your portulaca on a frequent basis once your plant is settled. Manually removing blossoms that have gone to seed ensures that your plants replace dead flowers. To deadhead, take a firm hold on a dried-up bloom, and them pull steadily. It will come off, revealing the bud of a new flower beneath it.Save a few of the heads if you want to reuse the seeds next year.  Moss roses are nearly as versatile as many weeds, but they can still be choked out if you don’t remove invasive plants. Weed weekly at the very least, for the amount of water your garden gets, and its fertility, are both factors in how many weeds your garden will attract.  Most moss rose varieties are annuals, which means that they don’t live past the autumn. You can replant them next year, even using the seeds you collected when deadheading them. Just crush the old flowers to reveal the seeds, then place them in an envelope and keep it in a cool, dry place until next year.	Find out if moss roses are right for you. Plan out your planting. Decide if you want seeds or seedlings. Get your flowers. Grow seeds indoors. Wait until after the last frost to plant outside. Plant outside. Make sure that the roots are set. Water your moss roses. Keep away from pets. Deadhead your plants. Weed your plants. Repeat the process next year.
Play with as many musicians as you can. Meeting other artists can lead to future opportunities. Collaborate with other established acts whenever possible.  A CD showcasing your abilities is a simple method of letting potential employers or band mates know what you can do.   Record a few solid tracks that highlight your drumming skills. It should be strong representation of your ability, and it should include some versatility in musical genres.  Carefully listen to all of the tracks you can find from the artist for whom you are auditioning. Practice the songs you are going to be playing by continuously running through them before the gig.  Knowing how to sight read a drum chart will impress during an audition, and it often can make a studio session run much more smoothly.  Tune your drums before a gig or audition. Replace old, worn out drumheads.  If an audition or performance goes badly, try to pinpoint what went wrong and straighten it out for the next time. Use your shortcomings to motivate you to improve your craft.  Playing live is vastly different than playing in the studio, and musicians are often judged by whether their live performance is up to par.	Network with other musicians. Record a demo. Prepare for auditions or studio sessions like a professional. Learn to read drum charts. Maintain your gear. Learn from your mistakes. Learn about stage presence and live performance skills.
They usually will if you call ahead for permission. Or obtain large pieces of cardboard elsewhere, for example, an appliance store.   The cardboard will stay flat better if you use a string trimmer to clear the area first. Trim as close to the ground as possible, being sure not to damage bark of shrubs or trees with the trimmer. You could also mow the area closely. If the ground is dry, water it. Put down cardboard, overlapping edges by at least 6". Weigh down the cardboard with bricks, large rocks, or best of all, a heavy (4") layer of mulch such as wood chips. This is most effective when the ground is damp and the growing season is active. Late winter is ideal in many climates. You can accomplish the same thing by putting down heavy layers of newspaper and covering with mulch. You may wish to pre-moisten the newspaper by dipping it in a bucket or wheelbarrow full of water. If you're using cardboard, remove tape, staples, labels, and anything else that won't break down eventually.; , By spring, all the weeds will have been smothered and it will be easier to start a garden there. Move the carpet to the next area and repeat. Cover the carpet with wood chips for improved aesthetics. In late spring, rake off the chips, remove the carpet, and rake the chips back onto the weed free area to keep new weeds from growing.   Carpet is not biodegradable, so plan to remove it before you plant.  In Idaho it costs five dollars. Rock makes a great mulch and will extend the growing season by retaining heat into the night. This is less environmentally friendly than wood chips, and small rocks may well work themselves into the soil and make it harder to dig weeds out.  Some electric companies remove plants that grow near wires and shred them. The electric company will deliver a load (dump truck) of not cleaned wood chips. Look in the yellow pages. Wood chips make perhaps the best mulch, except on vegetable gardens. Coarse wood chips allow weed seeds to fall down through them, then never get enough light to germinate. When the chips rot, they will improve the soil and you can add more. Use a generous layer—at least 4".   Place wood chips on top of cardboard or newspaper to exclude weeds for longer (at least until the mulches break down). The wood chips will soften the look of the material underneath.  (These also make a great wrap to protect shrubs through the winter.) Coffee shops may also be able to offer spent coffee grounds and filters, which can be composted or applied to soil directly.  They often are available for free to local residents at a service center or some other location. You will need to contact the appropriate office in your area to check. Be sure to bring your own rake or shovel and containers or pickup truck.  If you have a large tree that drops leaves, or your neighbors do, take a bin and collect them. You can use a lawn mower to help shred them, let the kids play in piles, or just use them whole. Whole leaves will take a lot longer to break down, but they will smother weeds better in the meantime.	Ask your local landfill if you can take some flattened cardboard home for your garden. Place a square of used carpet on the planned garden area and leave it over the winter. Get a permit from your local Forest Service to collect rocks. Many tree services and electric companies will deliver a free load of wood chips. Ask your local coffee shop if they throw out empty burlap coffee bean bags. Many cities or municipalities will collect branches and leaves in the fall, which are ground or chipped into a mulch. Collect your own leaves.
The kanji for "Kurenai" can also be read as "beni" which is a word used for red makeup used traditionally in Japan to color the lips red. The red she wears is somewhat dark, so look for darker shades. For the eye makeup, you should can wear lavender eyeshadow and apply black/dark mascara with thin, dark eyeliner. For the face, try to apply a thin layer of usually light colored foundation, and use cover-up for blemishes/scars.; , (Or, if on a really small budget, just wear a regular headband, preferably a dark blue.) Be sure to wear it covering most (but not all) of your forehead. That's just the style. The "bangs" should go over the headband.  Bangs should be grown out, and parted in the middle. They should also stick up over the headband, and then fall flat. (See photos of Kurenai for reference)  , If you really want to act like her, you also have to keep up with your personal hygiene.  Wigs should be styled slightly wavy in certain spots, with curls at the ends of strands.  Athletic tape can work well. Or just you can just wear a really long or tight wrist band if you want to give it that Kurenai touch.	As for the lips, wear red lipstick. Wear the Konoha {Leaf} village headband, which can easily be found online, in the mall, or in anime speciality stores for usually a low price. Wear your hair long, but not too long. Keep your face nice and clear. Have a medium black hair or get a nicely styled wig. Wear white (but not clear) tape on your wrists/almost halfway up your arms.
If you’re looking to create a uniform row of plants, try growing your plants from cuttings. This essentially means you are growing clones of a parent plant.   Growing from seed or bulb may mean your plants have more variety, which may not be the look you want to achieve.; , Remove any remnants of the previous year’s crop and any fallen branches, weeds, and stones. Till the ground to break up the soil to a depth of at least 6 inches (15.2 cm). Try to improve the soil by adding well-rotted manure. Add this manure well before you plan to plant your field.   For example, sweet peas will grow better if manure is dug into the beds at least a month ahead of planting time.  If you need to alter the soil pH, you should also plan to do this well before you plan to plant your field.   For example, if you are growing lavender (which favors an alkaline soil) you might try to add lime to acid soils to raise the pH.  A ‘green manure’ crop is a fast-growing crop that protects the soil’s nutrients and the soil structure while the field is bare. The green manure is then tilled back into the soil so the nutrients are returned and the soil is ready for the next crop (your flowers).   Green manures include alfalfa, buckwheat and clover.  This depends on which variety you are growing and what size the plants achieve, as well as how much space you need between rows in order to tend them. Start planning your rows by hammering a stake into the ground at both ends of the first row. Tie a piece of string between the stakes and use this to guide your planting.   Lavender plants need at least 30 inches (76.2 cm) between them, plus room for you to walk between the rows to prune and harvest (you should create rows that are at least the width of your shoulders).  Dig holes for your plants that are as deep as the plant container and twice as wide. Add a handful of slow release fertilizer, such as bonemeal, to the hole and mix the fertilizer in.   Don’t let the young plant’s roots touch the fertilizer directly.  You may find it helpful to carry a backpack watering device to help cover the large area of the field. You can then lay down weed proof matting, but this is not essential.   Water the young plants until they are established. Plants will usually become established within a few weeks.  You may want to lay an irrigation system to efficiently water your plants using minimal water. This is especially recommended for lavender, as watering directly to the base of the plant via an irrigation pipe laid on the ground helps avoid ‘splitting’, a problem that can occur from overhead watering.  Established plants such as lavender shouldn’t need watering unless it is exceptionally hot, dry or windy.   Check the pruning advice for your particular variety. Make sure you go out into your field regularly to inspect for problems such as bug attacks or disease.	Grow from cuttings it you want your field to have a uniform look. Prepare your soil. Alter the pH of the soil if necessary. Try planting a ‘green manure’ crop the previous year. Decide how wide the rows need to be. Dig your holes. Plant the young plants and water well. Create an irrigation system. Continue to care for your field of flowers.
,,,, Be careful because one bolt that is easier to see looks like it may be one to remove but its to the left of the correct one). Then loosen the pump from the block by tapping it with a wooden block and a mallet/hammer, but if it does not come loose pretty easily -- check again for another bolt.  If your water pump used a metal gasket and it is still secure to the engine and in good shape, do not remove it. Just clean it up and mount your new water pump to it. The metal gasket is better than any new fiber gasket that might have come with your new pump.  To tighten 12mm bolts securely without over-tightening, breaking one off: Start the bolts by hand; first just barely snug them, then gradually tighten them evenly, in two for three passes, in a star pattern, back and forth across, from side-to-side to minimize any possible warping. Seal the new gasket only onto the new pump with "gasket cement." Do not cement it onto the block. Put anti-seize grease on bolts. You can put an even coating of marine grease on the gasket after it is cemented onto the pump so it will not stick to the engine block.   Or if you prefer to use a silicone gasket maker, then apply a small even bead but not an excessive amount that could squeeze out and cause plugging/blockage of coolant passage-ways in the engine or radiator.  Hook the new spring in the hole of the tensioner ear/tab and use the Allen wrench in the hole that is in the front surface of the tensioner pulley for that wrench to bring the spring clockwise to get the spring near and then hooked onto the pin that protrudes from the engine block just above the pulley. Be sure the spring is hooked into the groove on the engine pin. , (Like a 1 inch (25.5 ~ 26mm) open end wrench on special hex-part of cam along the middle length of the cam can be used to budge the cam just slightly to get a cam timing mark back aligned while keeping the the stopper "jammed" in (to hold the sprockets/cams) in place until you get the belt on and the tension spring on correctly. So, starting at the crankshaft sprocket place the belt a little more than halfway onto the sprocket and then going counter-clockwise making sure the belt is tightly against the idler pulley/roller as you slip the belt onto the cam sprockets and tight across between the cam sprockets when on both of them.  While holding that hex wrench, begin to work the belt in steps farther onto each sprocket until it is on all the way. ,   Hand rotate the crankshaft two times around, using a wrench on the crankshaft sprocket bolt, then check to see that when the crankshaft key is aligned, then the two cam timing marks are still aligned as described earlier. Be sure one or both isn't off by one notch or something. If it is not aligned properly then remove the belt, carefully realign all 3 marks and reinstall the belt, and double-check it again.	Readying to remove the timing belt, you need to turn the timing belt-tensioner pulley toward "counter-clockwise" with an Allen "el-shaped" hex tool that fits in a hole in the pulley to rotate it to be able to slip the belt off little by little.  , Turn (pivot) the timing belt tensioner pulley toward "clockwise" with the Allen hex wrench enough to take the tension off of the timing belt tensioner spring, and then remove the spring with very long-nose-pliers.  , Remove the tensioner pulley by one bolt in the middle (14mm).  , Remove the "idler" pulley of the timing belt system by one bolt in the middle (14mm).  , Remove the 4 or 5 water pump bolts which are hard to see -- (12mm) socket -- and a medium size ratchet (called 3/8 inch drive in the USA). Clean the engine block surface carefully where the water pump gasket will make contact for sealing well -- so carefully scrape off any pieces of stuck-on old gasket material corrosion, rust, or dirt to bare metal but not gouging or roughing the metal. Put on the "new water pump"; follow instructions that came with it. Install the "new timing tensioner" pulley and tighten its mounting bolt securely. Install the new "idler pulley" and tighten the mounting bolt securely.  , Put on the "new timing belt"; follow instructions that came with it. Press the timing belt onto place while keeping the tensioner pulley out of the way enough, using the Allen hex wrench toward counterclockwise for the pulley to be as far backed off as possible to allow the belt to slide onto the sprockets. With the Allen wrench in the hole in the tensioner pulley for that purpose press it toward clockwise against the belt and press it in for a little tightening of the belt, and then release it slowly for the spring to bring it back into position.  , Remove the "stopper block" from the cams -- before you put on the top half-cover on the timing belt area.
Different string gauge and material give you different feel and sound. Research what you need by all means necessary, including playing your guitar. Some examples are; Rock genres- 46-36-26-15-13-10. Metal/down-tune- 54-48-42-24-17-12  , After finding a gauge you like string them onto your guitar and always stretch them. Remember that most guitars will not hold past certain brands of 56 gauge.  Sometimes a perfect lower gauge action will not be welcomed with a higher gauge string. Adjust your bridge referencing to step 1 to accumulate the best of your guitar.	Know what you need. Find a gauge. Adjust accordingly.
The Sailor Scouts are actually pretty nice, all of them. Even Rei Hino would do anything to help out her friends. Be nice to everyone you meet, and be especially kind to your friends. Also be very kind to animals and nature.  Don't be a bystander If someone is being bullied or picked on, go help them, and don't be afraid to yell at the bully! It's what the Sailor Scouts would do. Don't beat them up, however. That's NOT what a Sailor Scout would do.  Don't be mean and/or boss people around too much. People see the Sailor Scouts as natural leaders. And they are! Make yourself a natural leader too. After all, you just might end up being a moon princess!   Don't let people boss you around! Show them who's boss! Ask yourself, "What Would A Sailor Scout Do?"  , Almost all of the Sailor Scouts have a crush on someone, and many of them can come off as a bit boy-crazy sometimes, especially Usagi.   If you think you might have a crush on some, don't just ignore it! Daydream and talk about him, even take it a step further and ask the guy out. Come on, don't be scared. If you're a teenager, you could even end up being this dude's legit girlfriend! But whatever you do, DON'T try to make yourself like someone. It just doesn't work that way. Love can be made, but true love is born, not made.  It must take a LOT of bravery to fight scary monsters like that all the time! Don't you think so too? To be a good Sailor Scout, there is definitely going to be a lot of bravery involved. Can you make yourself braver? Well, here's an idea- if you're a Harry Potter fan, and in a scary situation, to act braver, just say "I'm a Gryffindor" over and over again. If you're not an HP fan, just say "If <favorite fictional character> can do <dangerous thing they have done>, then I can do this!"   Just follow those tips and you'll be braver in no time!  , You wouldn't the bad guys to find out your true identity, now, would you? Make sure not to tell ANYONE you are a Sailor Scout, and if they ask, just say something like "What makes you think that?" or just say "Umm...." and walk away.   You can tell some of your close friends and recruit them to be Sailor Scouts too! If they have never seen Sailor Moon, make sure you get them into it before officially making them a Sailor Scout.	Be nice. But don't let that stop you from being assertive!, Be cool, and show people who's in charge. Be romantic. Be brave. Don't flat-out tell anyone you're a Sailor Scout. Embrace your new identity!
Cut off the fabric you have selected. You can leave each fabric to different widths at will; fix the pieces to a whole pattern with pins; sew each combination respectively.; , Draw a heart shape to a size which you want your pillow to be on the paper; cut off the paper heart. Cut the pieced fabric to a heart shape according to the paper pattern. Make the other pieces of heart fabric in the same; seam the two pieces with obverse sides faced, leaving a small opening.  Turn over the heart to the observe side; stuff the quilting inside through the small opening. Sew the small opening after stuffing.	Piece the fabric. Sew two pieces of heart fabric. Stuff the heart. Make a bow with satin ribbon; sew the bow to the middle top of the heart.
If the stain is relatively fresh, it may be okay to use a mixture of soap and water to clean it. This method will likely be most useful within the first hour after the stain forms; after that, the egg white will dry and begin to etch into your topcoat of paint. Wet the stain with warm water to soften it before you begin manually cleaning., This is the solution you will be using to treat the stain. The gentler the soap, the better: ordinary car wash soap should be sufficient, or a regular-strength dish soap designed to cut grease. Hand soap won't do it. Harsher soaps contain astringent chemicals that can eat away at the paint and make the spot more noticeable. The warm water will help soften the stain and prepare it to be buffed out.   You can soak the soap and water mixture into a towel as you go, or prepare it in a spray bottle beforehand for ease of application. Watch out for industrial cleaners. They can be extremely harsh on paint, and if you're not careful you could make the problem worse.  Abrasive surfaces can damage your paint, especially if the job requires a lot of vigorous scrubbing. Find a microfiber towel or use the soft side of a kitchen sponge to go over the stain while leaving the paint unharmed.   While softer surfaces are less likely to damage your paint, it will take longer for them to work on the stain, increasing the total time of the process.  Once the stain is gone, dry the area with a microfiber towel. Make sure all traces of egg are gone before drying--if not, the streaks that soften and run off will dry again, and you're back to square one. If possible, put the car up for the night somewhere enclosed to give it time to dry completely.   A chamois or microfiber towel works best for drying as it absorbs and holds moisture.	Treat the stain right away. Combine a gentle soap with warm water. Use a towel or soft scrubber. Dry the spot thoroughly.
Insert the hook through the first stitch or space to be worked over.   The hook should not be attached to any yarn yet. Note that the right side of the piece should face toward you but the yarn should be at the back.  Grab the yarn with your hook. Pull both the yarn and hook through to the front of the piece.   You should have one loop on your hook after completing this step.  Insert the hook into the stitch or space directly next to the one you first worked in.  Yarn over the hook from back to front. In one motion, pull the yarn-over back through to the front of the work while also pulling it through the loop previously on your hook.   If this motion is too difficult for you to master, you can pull the yarn-over through to the front of the work first before pulling it through the loop on your hook. You've essentially just completed one chain stitch over the surface of the original piece, thereby securing the yarn in place.  Insert the hook back into the second worked stitch and follow the same procedure to create another chain stitch. Repeat this as many times as needed to build the size dot you desire.   For a moderately sized dot, create three to five of these stitches. Each of these chain stitches must be worked over the same stitch of your original piece.  When you're satisfied with the dot size, insert the hook through the stitch or space directly next to the one your chain stitches were worked into.  Yarn over the hook from back to front, then pull this yarn-over back through to the front of the work while simultaneously pulling it through the loop already on your hook.   As before, you can pull the yarn-over through to the front of the work before pulling it through the loop if doing so is easier for you. This final chain stitch closes the dot.  Cut the yarn, leaving a 4-inch (10-cm) tail. Pull this tail through the loop on your hook to finish and secure the stitch.   Pull the loose tail of yarn back through to the back of the work and weave it into the underside of the piece to hide it. This step also provides the dot with further security.	Insert the hook. Draw up a loop. Insert the hook into the next stitch. Chain one through the stitch. Repeat several times. Insert the hook into the next stitch. Chain one. Fasten off the yarn.
Hold the hanger with one hand at its center. Push the center of the hanger up toward the hanger hook but not too far in; there should still be a gap. This will narrow the hanger to a sort of sausage shape.  Use your other hand to reshape each end of the hanger into a butterfly wing shape.   Pull the wing parts out, then down. Make adjustments as needed, to get a wing-like appearance to both ends of the hanger. (The shape is up to you; be creative or imitate an exact butterfly wing shape.)  , Try to avoid the hook end poking out––tuck it in as neatly as you can. , (Do the same for both hangers.)   Pull right over the wing. Be careful when pulling over the hook part and try not to rip a hole in it. If it does rip, don't worry too much, just don't let it keep ripping––dab a bit of nail polish on it to stop this from happening. Knot each end of the stocking onto the hanger. Be sure that the stocking is pulled nice and tight; this makes painting it easier later. When tying the knot, knot before each of stocking ends so as to avoid the blocked part of the stocking from forming part of the wings (these will be snipped off shortly). Pull the stocking tight from the hook in the center, to even up the edges and to prevent any loose stocking from amassing in the center curve. Then gather this bit tightly with string or ribbon. The stocking should now sit snugly on the hanger. Repeat for the next hanger.  Trim close to the knot and discard the trimmed parts of the stocking.  Bend up at a sharp angle to create an opened effect to the wings. They should stand out when worn.   Do any additional reshaping as required, to ensure that they look like butterfly wings.  Using the folded hooks to create the center, wrap around the hooks with tape to keep in place.  Glue the ribbon end to the wrapped tape.  There are several choices here:   Use fabric paint. Use stripes, dots, patterns, etc. that copy those of real butterflies. Or do random colors and shapes. Dip the stockings in food coloring.  This can be anything you like, from glitter and artificial gems to buttons, sequins and other bits and bobs from the craft box.   Artificial flowers are another nice choice, especially added to the center part of the wings.  You may wish to color or match the elastic to the color of the wings, although this is not necessary. The width of the elastic is also up to you––just make sure it is comfortable and won't cut into the wearer.   Make two large enough circles of elastic to go over the wearer's arms. Knot the circles to keep them intact; trim off any excess. Slide the knotted circles over a wing each side.  Adjust to hide the knot, as needed.	Push the hanger into a butterfly  shape. Keep your hand positioned over the center top and bottom of the hanger. Bend the hook back on itself to create a circle. Repeat the exact same wing design for the other coat hanger.  , Pull on the knee-high stocking. Trim off the excess from each end of the stocking. Lay the wings down flat. Bring the wings together. Wrap around the center with ribbon to cover the taped portion. Paint the wings. Attach embellishments. Add elastic. Use the elastic circles to slide onto the wearer's arms.
Take the decal and slowly remove the white paper back from the sticker and clear plastic transfer tape. The white paper should come off without any sticking.         If the white paper sticks to the sticker decal, replace the white paper carefully. Use the credit card again to remove any air bubbles.  Position the decal exactly how you want it on the window. If there is a specific place you want the decal, you may want to mark the top edge or middle with tape before trying to place it. That will help you get the right spot.         Slowly and carefully place the decal on the window. Use the credit card or other object to rub over the transfer tape to securely adhere the decal to the window.  Leave the decal on the window with the transfer tape still attached for around 24 hours. This helps ensure that the decal sticks fully to the window. If you don't let the decal set, it may not adhere to the window as strongly.  Carefully take one corner of the clear transfer tape. Slowly remove the tape, making sure to peel it at an angle from the corner. Use gentle pressure so you don’t remove the decal.         If you remove the decal, reapply it to the window.

Before you dish out criticism, pause and consider whether you really need to say anything at all. If someone did something to get on your nerves, do you really need to point it out? Sometimes, it's best to let small indiscretions go. Try taking a few deep breaths and leaving the room instead of criticizing.It's best not to criticize someone's personality. People have very little control over personality quirks. If your friend Jane has a tendency to get caught up in her own interests, it might be best to just smile and nod while she's going on and on about a new TV show she loves. If this is just something she does, criticizing it will probably not result in the behavior changing.Avoid criticism that goes for someone's personality over his or her actions. For example, it may be a problem that your boyfriend forgets to pay his phone bill on time each month. However, saying something like "Why are you so forgetful?" isn't terribly productive. It may be best to be quiet for now and later, when you're calm, talk about finding productive ways to better manage bill payment, such as downloading a phone app that will provide a reminder when it is time to pay the phone bill every month.; , Critical people often have very high expectations of those around them. It's possible your tendency to criticize stems from expecting too much from those around you. If you find yourself consistently annoyed or disappointed with others, it may be a good idea to adjust your expectations.Think about the last time you criticized someone. What lead to this criticism? Were your expectations in the situation realistic? For example, say you criticized your girlfriend for not answering your texts quickly enough when she was out with friends. You told her this made you feel uncared for and that she should have answered right away. Pause and examine these expectations. Can you really expect your girlfriend to be on her phone when she's socializing? Isn't your girlfriend entitled to a social life outside of your relationship? You have probably occasionally missed texts or returned them late if you were busy. In this case, maybe you could adjust your expectations. It may not be reasonable to expect a text returned immediately if you know your girlfriend is hanging out with other people.  Oftentimes, critical people have a tendency to personalize events that occur around them.This can bleed out into personalizing the actions of others. If someone gets on your nerves or makes your life difficult, you may feel the urge to criticize that person. However, remember other people have their own separate lives and struggles. If someone did something to bother you, the majority of the time their actions were not directed at you.   For example, say you have a friend who routinely cancels plans. You may take this as an act of disrespect and feel compelled to criticize that person for not valuing your relationship. However, realistically your friend's actions are probably not personal. Look at the situation from an outside perspective. Is your friend very busy? Is she just generally a flaky person? Is your friend more introverted than others? A variety of factors may make a person cancel plans often. Chances are, it isn't about you personally. Criticizing may add more stress to someone whose life is already stressful.  Critical people are often guilty of filtering. This means you only focus on the negative aspects of a situation or a person, failing to see good qualities alongside negative ones.This may lead to your criticizing others. If you find yourself making assumptions about a person's character, stop yourself. Try to separate a frustrating action from the person doing the action. We all behave poorly sometimes, but a single action is not a reflection of character.   If you see someone cut in line, do you immediately think that person is rude? If so, stop for a moment and reconsider. Maybe that person is in a hurry. Maybe he has a lot on his mind, and he did not realize he cut. You can be frustrated by the action. Getting cut in line is annoying. However, try not to judge a stranger's character based on the action.If you work on separating the person from the action, you may naturally want to criticize less. As you come to realize you cannot judge a person's character based on a single choice or decision, you will be unable to call someone out for being rude or disrespectful.  Oftentimes, being critical results from how you're choosing to see a situation. Everyone has flaws and imperfections. However, the vast majority of people have good qualities that outweigh these flaws. Try to focus on a person's positive qualities over their negative ones.   Having a positive attitude can change the way you react to stress. Negative emotions activate the amygdala, which is a major trigger of feelings of stress an anxiety. If you're feeling keyed up yourself, this can lead to negative interactions with others. Working on developing a positive attitude can help you stop criticizing others.Believe everyone has some natural goodness in them. While you may be skeptical of this fact, try giving everyone the benefit of the doubt in this regard. Go out of the way to look for people doing good in the world. Focus on the person in the supermarket who told the cashier to have a nice day. Pay attention to the coworker who always smiles at you on your way to your desk.Oftentimes, people's flaws actually stem from other, positive qualities. For example, your boyfriend may take a long time to complete basic household tasks. This could be because he's more conscientious than others. Maybe he spends an extra 20 minutes doing the dishes because he makes the effort to get them extra clean.	Think before you speak. Be realistic. Depersonalize other people's actions. Separate the individual from their actions. Focus on positives.

Aim for antioxidant-rich foods such as berries, beans, apples, avocados, almonds, oranges, and pears.The antioxidants protect your body’s tissues against the stress and inflammation caused by illness while boosting your immune system. Try to eat foods containing omega-3s (such as salmon), which stimulate blood flow and also boost immune function.Add a little onion and garlic to your meals. Garlic is known to have anti-viral, antibiotic, and antiseptic properties, and onion can soothe congestion and other respiratory issues.  Make yourself a smoothie. There are many simple smoothie recipes that you can make. Smoothies are easy to digest and give you a dose of powerful vitamins that your immune system needs to recover from an illness.Avoid foods high in sugar and fat. Sugar can suppress your immune system and fat is harder for your body to digest when sick.You need more calories than usual when you're sick because your body is working hard to heal itself, so don't be afraid to indulge moderately in comfort foods. Keep your portions reasonably sized and avoid overindulging in any one food. Opt for healthy versions of your comfort foods - if your comfort food is ice cream, for example, go for a low fat ice cream or sherbet., Staying well-hydrated benefits your respiratory system and helps your immune system work optimally.Keep a glass or bottle of water near you at all times and try to drink as much as you possibly can.   According to Ayurveda, drinking hot water with honey and lemon is a great way to feel better when sick as well as to cleanse your body. Add some lemon to your water for a tasty boost of vitamin C. Lemon also supports your immune system.  Herbal tea will help keep you hydrated while offering many additional health benefits. For example, drinking ginger tea can help with fever reduction and stimulates your circulatory system. Ginger also has a soothing effect on coughing and other respiratory issues.Chamomile tea will soothe you and help you get to sleep more easily. Elderberry tea can lower a fever and has blood purification properties.Add a little raw honey to your cup of herbal tea for additional benefits. Honey can soothe a sore throat and has antibacterial, antimicrobial, and antiseptic properties. Add a slice of lemon for a vitamin c boost. Lemon can also help reduce phlegm., Gentle stretches will help ease aching muscles and get you moving around a bit. This will increase your blood circulation. If you feel up to it, try some simple yoga poses along with your stretching.   If the stretching hurts or makes you feel worse in any way, stop immediately.  Our bodies recover from illnesses during sleep. Getting plenty of it keeps your immune system functioning at an optimum level. Get at least seven to eight hours of rest every night for a faster recovery.Take plenty of naps throughout the day, along with getting a full night’s sleep. If you find that you are unable to sleep or just not sleepy, at least lay down and relax.  Vitamin C, zinc, garlic and vitamin E are great supplements to support your system when sick with cold and flu.Check with your doctor before starting any new supplements, especially if you are on medication.	Eat well. Drink plenty of water. Sip herbal tea. Do some gentle stretching. Get plenty of sleep. Take supplements.
Journaling can be a great way to process your thoughts while your partner is away. You can also easily keep a journal if you're deployed. Write in a journal a few times a week, chronicling your thoughts and emotions regarding your partner's absence. When you and your partner are reunited, share some of the most heartfelt sections of your journal with your partner., While distance is difficult, it can sometimes provide the opportunity for self-exploration and personal growth. While your partner is away, take this as a chance to explore some of your own interests and passions. Join a book club. Take a cooking class. Take up a new hobby, like running or knitting. Try to make the most of the time you have alone to better get to know yourself and your interests.If you're deployed, it may not be difficult to keep busy. A particularly active deployment should keep your mind engaged. However, some deployments are less hectic than others. While it may be hard to, say, join a cooking class when deployed, you can look into solitary pursuits. You can try reading and writing, for example. Try to explore subjects that interest you by reading books on these subjects during your spare moments away.  During your separation, you and your partner should both have access to healthy support networks. People are social by nature, and even if your partner is gone you need people you can reach out to.If you're being deployed, do not hesitate to get close to your fellow soldiers. Open up to them about your struggles and stress, and talk about how you're managing your long distance relationship. If you're staying at home, reach out to friends and family members. You should also reach out to your partner's friends and families. Spending time with people close to your partner can help you feel close to him or her from a distance.  It's important to keep things in perspective while your partner is away. Have friends and family members you can talk to when you feel frustrated or afraid in your partner's absence. If you know another person with a partner in the military, this person may be able to help you keep things in perspective. While this time is difficult, keep in mind it will not last forever. Try to keep in mind that things are temporary, and your relationship may be stronger after your partner returns.If you're deployed, some of your fellow soldiers have probably also left partners at home during deployment. Try to talk to fellow soldiers about how you're feeling, and ask them for advice on how to cope. Some soldiers have probably been deployed multiple times, and may have advice for you on how to keep things in perspective.	Keep a journal. Explore your own interests. Find a support network. Keep things in perspective.
To really enjoy the series, you need to understand the following:   The Doctor is a Time Lord, an advanced humanoid race that has harnessed the power of manipulating time. Their home planet is Gallifrey. The Doctor is constantly traveling through Time and Space. In the return of the Doctor Who series in the new millennium, it is revealed that the Time Lords have been exterminated as the result of a huge conflict between themselves and the Daleks, known as the Time War. Hence, visits to Gallifrey are not longer a part of the series but you can certainly see Gallifrey in earlier episodes of the series. All the same, there are lingering aspects of Gallifrey and other Time Lords that continue to run through the Doctor Who series, so be watchful! The main character of Doctor Who is known only as "The Doctor". We're not actually sure of his real name (so far it has not been revealed to the audience), although there are plenty of times when it is shown to be of importance, and indeed, in series 6 (2011), it becomes clear that the question of who the Doctor really is is of some considerable future importance. The show's title is not a reference to his name, but rather an occasional joke in which someone asks "Doctor Who?" when he identifies himself as "The Doctor". Time Lords, while they can die, more typically regenerate into entirely new individuals in body, temperament, and outlook. However, they can only regenerate twelve times (thirteen bodies), at least this is what we're currently told. However, it has been speculated that this was only a superficial limit imposed by Gallifrey's leaders on other Time Lords, and the Doctor, being the last Time Lord, may well be able to regenerate as many times as he wants. We presume gender as well, because the Doctor has never become female but this could change. Time Lords are not immortal, as all but two of them died in the Time War ("the Master" being the other known surviving Time Lord so far). The Tenth Doctor was portrayed by David Tennant, the eleventh by Matt Smith. These two Doctors have proven wildly popular with audiences. Distinctive Doctors from the past include Tom Baker and Jon Pertwee. If you are just trying to jump into the newer series make sure you start with number nine, by Christopher Eccleston. The Doctor is always very intelligent, cares about Earth and humans, and defending what's right. He solves problems chiefly through his wits, rather than violence, although he will engage in combat if needed.; , The Doctor never goes long without a companion or two. Usually these are attractive young females but he has also traveled with male companions and non-human companions on occasion. Although the Doctor isn't very romantically motivated and seems to be mindful of much greater thinking pursuits, it is implied that he fell in love with one female companion, Rose Tyler, who eventually gets trapped in a parallel universe and they are forced to part permanently in a tearful scene. In later shows, the eleventh Doctor is kissed by his companion but it's all the result of "timey-wimey" mix-ups and causes the Doctor to realize that he needs to get her husband to come along too.   K-9 is a robotic dog-like companion that the Doctor relies on in earlier incarnations of the Doctor.One of his companions, Sarah Jane, later leaves him and takes K-9 with her, spinning off her own TV series later on.  The TARDIS hurls through space on another adventure. It is the Doctor's spaceship – he cannot travel in Time and Space without it. It looks like an old-fashioned British police box. However, inside it's a sophisticated spaceship, and many times bigger inside than it is outside. The Doctor is fiercely protective and proud of his TARDIS. The TARDIS stands for Time And Relative Dimension(s) In Space. For more information check out: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TARDIS  , The Doctor relies ever more increasingly on his Sonic Screwdriver, a multipurpose tool.In earlier incarnations of the Doctor, this screwdriver has a few useful purposes but in recent episodes, it appears to be able to do everything (and probably can make a good pot of coffee too, if the Doctor asked it to).  It wouldn't be great sci-fi without the enemies intent on destroying Earth, each other, other worlds and generally wreaking havoc and adding bad vibes wherever they stomp. There are too many enemies to list here but some include:   A Dalek – an enemy of the Time Lords (specifically the Doctor) and the human race. These are an army of cyborgs, genetically engineered mutations inside a bonded polycarbonate shell that look like R2-D2's cousins from hell. They tend to yell "Exterminate! Exterminate!" a lot. These are reoccurring antagonists. For more info, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalek. Cybermen These are cyborgs. They are emotion-drained humans turned robots with no sense of emotional hold-back when it comes to killing. They seem to turn up almost anywhere, anytime, just like the daleks.The Master. He was the Doctor's friend once on Gallifrey, who turns into his worst enemy in the classic series. Knowledge of him will get you respect among previous generation fans. He is also in the series three (season 29) finale and may well pop up again some time. For more info, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_(Doctor_Who).  Doctor Who, as a series, reaches back into the early 1960s. The style, writing, special effects, and so on vary a lot from one season to another. If you enjoy classic sci-fi (original Star Trek, for instance), try the classic episodes. If you prefer more current sci-fi, you can start with the current series. However, if you really want to love Doctor Who and all it represents, watch them all. If you're Gen X, it's highly probable that you have. Both series are great, if you are jumping into the newer series start with number nine.  Allen/Virgin Publishing Ltd. Target novelisations of the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s Doctor Who adventures. These are long out of print, but you can still obtain them from specialist dealers and perhaps online. Second-hand bookshops usually stock them too. Also, check out the original Doctor Who novels from BBC Books, which are set in suitable gaps between the Doctor's television adventures and take the series' concept into areas that television technology and budget limitations could never do.  While you can certainly enjoy Doctor Who without knowing the elaborate history, mysteries, and so on that has developed over the decades, learning these details can greatly enhance the experience. Learn from other fans, web sites, blogs and so on.  BBC sells lots of merchandise and authorizes a lot of online and retail companies to sell items too. You can get Dalek torches (flashlights) through to full size TARDIS models that you can sleep in. Just go with what fits and suits your budget!

As a rule of thumb, if repair costs are 50% or more of the cost of a new fridge, you should buy a new fridge. There are two main reasons to do so. First, as refrigerators age, they will need more and more repairs. Second, replacing an older refrigerator gives you the opportunity to get a more efficient model that will reduce your energy costs., Different types of fridges are more prone to needing repairs and have varied overall lifespans. For instance, built-in refrigerators are generally worth repairing. In general, however, any fridge that is only a year or two old is worth repairing., Side-by-side fridge and freezer appliances are usually worth repairing for the first five years of their life, and fridges with a bottom freezers are usually worth repairing for seven years or so. Fridges with freezers on top can usually be repaired within the first three years of their life, but may need to be replaced in seven years or less., Refrigerators are expected to last between 10 and 20 years. If yours is at least 10 years old and has begun to have issues, it’s simply time for a replacement. Not only will repairs on older models be more expensive, the fridge will likely need additional repairs sooner than later, and a newer model will be more energy efficient., If you find that you are not using all of the space in your present refrigerator, consider replacing it with a smaller model. For instance, if your children have grown up and moved out, you may find that a full size fridge is no longer necessary for your household.	Replace a fridge that would require expensive repairs. Lean towards repairs on younger fridges. Default to repairs depending on the type of the fridge. Retire fridges older than 10 years. Consider downsizing whenever possible.
A tall, open posture is key to unlocking your best singing voice. Practice in front of a mirror, looking from the front and side, to make sure you're up straight and following the best posture guidelines:Remember:   Shoulders back. Chin level with the floor. Chest out. Stomach flat. Joints relaxed., You should feel pressure in your chest, as if you voice is coming from your pec muscles, instead of your head or neck. When you sing in your "head voice," you can feel your voice up in your throat and head, as if there was a little vibration there. Work on "moving" this vibration around, playing with your voice until you feel it in your chest. This is the feeling you want when singing.   You want to move air from your diaphragm, not your throat, head, or mouth.  When you breathe, breath "horizontally," with your stomach moving out as you inhale and in as your exhale. Working from your belly keeps your chest steady and helps control your air.Imagine you're wearing a belt around your belly. As you inhale, it slides down to make room for more air. As you exhale, it slides up your belly to move air up through your chest and out your mouth.In "normal" breathing, your chest moves. But singers need a solid, unmoving chest to keep a steady stream of air coming.  Regular breathing is short and shallow -- as you rarely need a ton of oxygen. Singers, however, need to save their air to sing with. To do so, focus on big, quick inhalations and slow, even exhales. As you sing, you want to imagine one continuous, unchanging stream of air coming out. It takes work, but this is perhaps the single best thing you can do to become a better pop singer.When inhaling, think of just opening your whole throat to let air in, instead of trying to suction it in. It is much more effective this way.  The sooner you notice these issues and fix them, the faster you'll learn to sing any genre effectively. Each of these issues is likely something you've done or felt yourself doing because they feel like good ideas. However, you'll notice the difference once you make corrections.    Tanking up: This is when people try to fill their lungs extra big. But better singers just release their air with slow, even breaths to make their air last longer, not fill up with more of it.  Pushing the air: You want to think of "letting" the air out gently, not forcing it.  Holding back air: Think of how a car jerks right when you hit the gas. This is when a singer stops their voice right between inhaling and exhaling. You want to work on breathing “into” your note, silently exhaling air quickly just before starting to sing so that the note slides out smoothly.	Stand upright, with your head up, chest out, and joints relaxed for the best singing posture. Focus on moving air from your chest while singing. Use your abdomen for breathing, moving air through the belly. Focus on deep, even streams of air to control your breathing. Keep your eyes and ears out for common breathing mistakes.
In order to build a basic robot, you'll need several simple components. You can find most, if not all, of these components at your local electronics hobby shop, or at a number of online retailers. Some basic kits may include all of these components as well. This robot does not require any soldering:   Arduino Uno (or other microcontroller) 2 continuous rotation servos 2 wheels that fit the servos 1 caster roller 1 small solderless breadboard (look for a breadboard that has two positive and negative lines on each side) 1 distance sensor (with four-pin connector cable) 1 mini push button switch 1 10kΩ resistor 1 USB A to B cable 1 set of breakaway headers 1 6 x AA battery holder with 9V DC power jack 1 pack of jumper wires or 22-gauge hook-up wire Strong double-sided tape or hot glue; , You'll be building the robot's body using the battery pack as a base.  This should be the end that the battery pack's wire is coming out of The servos should be touching bottoms, and the rotating mechanisms of each should be facing out the sides of the battery pack. It's important that the servos are properly aligned so that the wheels go straight. The wires for the servos should be coming off the back of the battery pack.  Make sure that they are solidly attached to the battery pack. The backs of the servos should be aligned flush with the back of the battery pack.   The servos should now be taking up the back half of the battery pack.  It should hang over the front of the battery pack just a little bit, and will extend beyond each side. Make sure that it is securely fastened before proceeding. The "A" row should be closest to the servos.  If you attached the servos properly, there should be a flat space made by them touching. Stick the Arduino board onto this flat space so that the Arduino's USB and Power connectors are facing the back (away from the breadboard). The front of the Arduino should be just barely overlapping the breadboard.  Firmly press the wheels onto the rotating mechanism of the servo. This may require a significant amount of force, as the wheels are designed to fit as tightly as possible for the best traction.  If you flip the chassis over, you should see a bit of breadboard extending past the battery pack. Attach the caster to this extended piece, using risers if necessary. The caster acts as the front wheel, allowing the robot to easily turn in any direction.If you bought a kit, the caster may have come with a few risers that you can use to ensure the caster reaches the ground.  You'll be using these to connect the servos to the breadboard. Push the pins down through the header so that the pins come out in an equal distance on both sides.  Make sure that they are firmly inserted.  This will connect the servos to the breadboard. Make sure the left servo is connected to the left header, and the right servo to the right header.  Make sure you use the red rail on the back of the breadboard (closer to the rest of the chassis).  Make sure that you use the blue rail on the back of the breadboard. Do not plug them into the red rail pins.  This will allow the Arduino to control the servos and turn the wheels.  It does not get plugged into the outer power rails on the breadboard, but instead into the first row of lettered pins (J). Make sure you place it in the exact center, with an equal number of pins available on each side.  This will ground the sensor.  This will power the sensor.  This will feed information from the sensor to the microcontroller.  Orient it so that the battery pack cable is coming out to the left at the bottom.  Make absolutely sure that the battery pack is oriented correctly.  These two cables will help provide the correct voltage to the Arduino.  The black cable should be plugged into the blue rail pin at pin 30. The red cable should be plugged into the red rail pin at pin 30.  Connect it at pin 28 on the blue rail.  Do not connect the red rails, as you will likely damage the Arduino.  This will provide the power to the Arduino.  This switch will allow you to turn off the robot without having to unplug the power.  This will power the button.  Connect it to the pin directly next to the black wire that you connected a few steps ago.  This will allow the Arduino to register the push button.  This is the Arduino development environment, and allows you to program instructions that you can then upload to your Arduino microcontroller. You can download it for free from arduino.cc/en/main/software. Unzip the downloaded file by double-clicking it and move the folder inside to an easy to access location. You won't be actually installing the program. Instead, you'll just run it from the extracted folder by double-clicking arduino.exe.  Plug the battery back jack into the connector on the Arduino to give it power.  Windows will likely not recognize the device.  This will launch the Device Manager.  If you don't see this option, click "Properties" instead, select the "Driver" tab, and then click "Update Driver."  , This will allow you to select the driver that came with the Arduino IDE.  You'll find a "drivers" folder inside. , You'll be greeted with a blank project.  The code below will make your Arduino continuously move forward.      #include <Servo.h> // this adds the "Servo" library to the program   // the following creates two servo objects Servo leftMotor; Servo rightMotor;   void setup() {     leftMotor.attach(12); // if you accidentally switched up the pin numbers for your servos, you can swap the numbers here     rightMotor.attach(13); }     void loop() {     leftMotor.write(180); // with continuous rotation, 180 tells the servo to move at full speed "forward."     rightMotor.write(0); // if both of these are at 180, the robot will go in a circle because the servos are flipped. "0" tells it to move full speed "backwards." }     , Click the right arrow button in the upper-left corner to build and upload the program to the connected Arduino.   You may want to lift the robot off of the surface, as it will just continue to move forward once the program is uploaded.  Add the following code to the "void loop()" section of your code to enable the kill switch, above the "write()" functions.      if(digitalRead(2) == HIGH) // this registers when the button is pressed on pin 2 of the Arduino {     while(1)     {         leftMotor.write(90); // "90" is neutral position for the servos, which tells them to stop turning         rightMotor.write(90);     } }     , With the kill switch code added, you can upload and test the robot. It should continue to drive forward until you press the switch, at which point it will stop moving. The full code should look like this:      #include <Servo.h>   // the following creates two servo objects Servo leftMotor; Servo rightMotor;   void setup() {     leftMotor.attach(12);      rightMotor.attach(13); }     void loop() {     if(digitalRead(2) == HIGH)      {         while(1)         {             leftMotor.write(90);              rightMotor.write(90);         }     }       leftMotor.write(180);      rightMotor.write(0);  }	Gather your components. Flip the battery pack over so that the flat back is facing up. Align the two servos on the end of the battery pack. Affix the servos with your tape or glue. Affix the breadboard perpendicularly on the open space on the battery pack. Attach the Arduino microcontroller to the tops of the servos. Put the wheels on the servos. Attach the caster to the bottom of the breadboard. Break off two 3-pin headers. Insert the two headers into pins 1-3 and 6-8 on row E of the breadboard. Connect the servo cables to the headers, with the black cable on the left side (pins 1 and 6). Connect red jumper wires from pins C2 and C7 to red (positive) rail pins.

Two sound waves moving up and down together are said to be "in phase." When one of the waves is moving up at the same time as the other wave moves down, the waves are said to be "out of phase." Out-of-phase waves cancel each other out, resulting in a flat line of sound.Flipping the phase on one speaker will cancel the matching signal's waves in the other speaker.The efficiency of this as a technique is pretty debatable. It may theoretically work, but it's not a way to save a song file without vocals.  Each speaker usually has two wires going into it, one with a positive lead and one with a negative lead. Usually these are red and white, black and red, or black and white. Sometimes, they're black and black. Swap the two wires going into one speaker around.   Where the black wire was connected, connect the red wire, and move the red wire to the black wire's terminal. Many modern stereo systems and head phones do not allow you to swap wires on the back of one speaker. Sometimes the wires are bundled into one wire sleeve. The only way to swap the bundled wires is to splice them or re-solder the connector.  There are special digital techniques using chips called Digital Signal Processors to do the flipping of the wave inside the stereo or hi-fi. Usually the button is a "Karaoke" button, which flips the one side of the stereo image phase.   If your stereo or app has one of these, then just press it and the Lead Vocals will get very soft or disappear.  Background vocals are often mixed more to the left or right, so these are hard to remove. You will have to sing along with them and pretend they are your very own backing choir, if you're trying to make a karaoke track.   Flipping phase really affects Bass waves. So the Bass might disappear along with the Lead Vocals. Digital DSP Karaoke systems will fix this by flipping the phase on only the Vocal frequencies. Try adjusting the levels on your stereo to get it to sound correct. Sophisticated vocal removal systems or software allow you to decide which frequencies get flipped out of phase.	Understand the concept of channel phase. Find the wires leading into the back of one speaker. Use a digital phase processor. Adjust the levels to accommodate for the loss of vocals.
What we normally consider as "us" or "me" is an accumulated collective of memories, knowledge, habits, culture and beliefs (etc.) but the foundation for all of our consciousness is without a "True" or pre-determined meaning, theme, or background, and remains only an assumption made by our individual brains.   Consider seeing the world for the first time, then consider the knowledge and experience that has created all the layers that makes you as a person say "this is me and mine". Yet even as a baby, there are countless psychological processes and interactions that result in a "you" that was there before you were born. If you were to take away all these aspects of "you," anything that remains would be meaningless, or inhuman, to you. If you were to remove all your memories, habits and all the things you identify as you, you could not consider what is left behind because it is no longer within the realm of mundane human understanding and ideas. In essence, the identity of a person is dependent on a large variety of internal and external factors, each of them impermanent and often acting individually, or without our direct awareness and if these individual processes were put aside there is no remainder. This philosophy may seem concerning because it requires us to re-examine and re-evaluate many of the cultural and personal ideas and attachments we have.; , Just as animals react to similar things that we do (such as reacting to hunger, or feelings, or temperature, or to being confronted by an attacker), animals can also plan and remember (elephants have exceptional memory for places, gorillas can learn to communicate using human methods, crows recognize human faces and communicate this to other crows, predators maintain hunting grounds, etc). Note the similarities between human beings and their animal cousins, how connected we are in our daily patterns and motivations, and how little difference there is between us all.   We could pinpoint language as a unique trait, but then dogs bark and howl, birds twitter and squawk and there is a wide range of animal body language such as baring teeth, tensing and "puffing up" which some animals (including humans) use to seem bigger and stronger, etc. Words are just like programming code, but body language is far more deeply ingrained, like firmware to language's software. Consider that other animals have similar characteristics and functional abilities based in the genetic coding responsible for our hardware.  Is there purpose in stones, water, or even the world? Probe your own response to this question, as underneath your assertions are a great many assumptions about the nature of the world and reality. The concept of Void-ness would remind you that each assumption must be examined and its own arbitrary, all-together human foundation recognized, until nothing remains.   Socrates is possibly best known for the paraphrased quote, "I am the wisest, because only I know that I know nothing." There is a hidden meaning to this paradox in that it is not a paradox at all. It is not one answer or the other, but each reciprocally answering the other, never settling on a single "Answer." Mastering this is key to understanding the Void. Consider the scale of the universe from its galaxies and stars down to the tiny bacteria, atoms and subatomic particles. All these things change, are impermanent and are independently in motion. Consider how the planets are racing though space around the Sun or other stars. If you keep expanding this perspective to take the stars into account and any planets they may have, is there evidence or not of some plan or a great mover of those stars and planets, as opposed to physics? Try to consider a weighted average between your experience and the views of others in this regard.  If it were possible to set things in motion such as starting a spinning top and then letting it go, are there any demonstrable patterns that evidence where they are intended to end up? Voidness by nature puts into stark contrast that many of these "design" or "plan" questions may never be resolved, because part of the question was without basis in what is actually occurring. Voidness in practice requires a person to put aside these questions in order to prevent bias or selective observation and that a person without opinion, desire or preferences, observe that things are simply as they are.  It might be possible that the universe was purposefully set in motion and left to its own devices, much like a spinning top, but then it might also be possible for the forces of physics to start it and keep it going without assistance. It is a consistent variation between two main philosophies, either (a) One option is that some entity set all of reality in motion or (b) Another option is that physics, every particle/wave, is acting as it must, void of plan or controller, impermanent, changing and dynamic responding to cause and effect and that a true singular beginning is simply not evident but is a result of continuous change. Each option has demonstrable evidence in the eyes of individual observers, however in this instance it is important to be aware when the observation and interpretation of such evidence is selective and/or relative. Therefore a person must observe it as it is, without bias or shaping. Try to find out which approach you consider most apt, either by studying the vast universe and physics, or life and the terrestrial animals of Earth, but always looking for a pattern or demonstrable evidence to support your theories. Einstein proved, to his own satisfaction at least, that everything came from nothing. Your own evaluations matter in your search for the truth, as well as the views of others, but it is wise to not depend on any one view for exploring your mind and the world. The Buddha, who spoke much on the subject, described the varying and opposing philosophies of his day (many of which are mainstream today), as "A jungle of views, a tangle of views". While many tried to juggle and cut their way through them to find the facts for themselves, the Buddha realised it was necessary to abandon those which did not match what was real, even if it was an enchanting or self-empowering philosophy. If a person was to continue to hold on to a firm set belief or hypothesis during their search for the facts, or searching for an answer to a question tied to a belief structure, they would not be able to have both. Philosophy therefore is about the scientific process of observation and analysis in relation to personal experiences and should not be about reaching absolute certainty. While the laws of physics can be highly transcendental and enlightening, it is the rare minority who go down that path as it is not self-empowering, nor inclining towards power or debate. The concepts of the words "absolute certainty" are themselves neither absolute, nor certain, due to the universal nature of impermanence and change. As it has been aptly said, "A little knowledge is a dangerous thing", a person intent on researching this subject must not only consider both options to a deep level, not a trivial level, but at the same time accept that while there is many interpretations of life and the universe, there is only this reality which is as it is.  If you feel anything at all, try to find out what and why, as well as how it influences your perception of all other things in life.  See if that changes anything. You might find that if you feel uncomfortable, it might be because you're handling a new idea, but that's a good thing – allow yourself to be stretched intellectually. Then ask yourself whether those feelings influence what you believe to be the nature of existence.   If you find the idea is liberating, scary in its implications, or want to see if your conclusions can be tested, then look outside into the world. Stay mindful of the ideas you are looking for, see if their patterns repeat with any significance in reality.  Consider in what way you will move beyond the voidness to continue engaging with the world by letting go of "socially constructed" thoughts and feelings and looking beyond them.  We have no choice about dying at some point, but we get to choose how to live. It is important to remember that by avoiding making our own path in order to follow another's interpretation or opinions, we never develop deeply as human beings and life remains without depth. Potentially living with information that is all second hand as we have made no discoveries or insights of our own. The knowledge gained by exploring Voidness is knowing what promotes a happy, healthy and peaceful life, and what results in stress, illness and strife. There can be power, dignity, and honor in thinking for oneself and to co-exist in harmony with one's environment. Good luck and have fun!	Consider a bold theory for starters, namely that voidness or emptiness occurs because it is in-between what is "there" to us. Examine other living things. Consider non-living things. Look for evidence of a beginning which shows the mark of a scheduled plan. Work out what your feelings are in relation to the idea of void, such as whether you find the idea of voidness scary, comforting, or strange, and so forth. Look where new emotions point you. See how you can use your thinking and experiences to improve your life and make the world a better place. Finally, remember above all this: In a world void of pre-determined meaning, you are free to make your own.
Keep them well watered, but not soaked. The soil should always have a little moisture.   Water the plants early in the day so the leaves have time to dry in the sun before nightfall. Leftover moisture on the leaves can lead to diseases. Make sure the plants are especially well-watered when they are in flower.  After about five weeks, the potato stalks will have grown several inches above the soil. Create "hills" by mounding soil over the stalks. You can cover them completely or allow the very top of the stalks to peek through. New potatoes will grow just under the soil, above the seeds potatoes that were planted earlier.   If you planted the potatoes in rows, your "hills" should be connected to make long ridges. If you planted the potatoes in one circular mound, you should end up creating one big hill. As the stalks continue to grow, hill the potatoes every 2 - 3 weeks. Each time you add another layer to the hill, another layer of potatoes will grow just underneath the surface of the soil.	Water the plants. Hill the potatoes.
Create a triangle but curve its lower part and then add an angled line on its center. Make sure you also draw the pyramid at the left part of your paper.   Draw a triangle.       Draw a guideline from the tip tilted to the right.       Connect the two remaining corners to the lower end of the guideline.       Having erased the excess lines you get a generic pyramid, let's make it Egyptian.       Draw this pattern in different places in the pyramid, it will make it look like it's made of bricks.       Use yellow and brown to make it look real.      ; ,, Add some palm trees too. Sketch the trees with a small burst and then a thin rectangle line below the burst. Remember it doesn’t have to be perfect  , Erase your penciled marks to clean up your drawing.  Use colors such as an orange, yellow/green, mud green, teal, sky blue and yellow.	Start by drawing a pyramid. Sketch large wavy lines to illustrate the sand dunes surrounding it.  , Add a small circle on top of the pyramid for the sun. Outline your drawing by inking over your sketched lines using a pen or marker. Color it in and you’re done.
Typical items of clothing that work well for potato printing include caps, socks, tights, t-shirts and canvas shoes. You can probably find other clothes to work with too.; , If the clothing item is a sock, sleeve or leg, it'll need to be protected from the paint printing through to the unprinted side. To do this:   Draw and cut out a cardboard template the same shape as the item you're seeking to protect. Slip the template inside the sock, sleeve or leg to provide a suitable barrier.	Decide which pieces of your clothing need major design improvement. Protect the clothing item.
As with any major purchase, setting a budget is an important first step. Consider how much money you can comfortably afford to use for the purchase of a car alarm system. While alarm systems can vary quite a bit in price, a quality machine can usually be found in any price range.; ,   Some of the more basic car alarm systems will alarm only when direct damage is done to the car. In contrast, others begin alarming at the mere sensation of motion, and others even contain theft-tracking software. Finally, the most advanced alarm systems may alert emergency companies and organizations when triggered. Be aware that in most cases, as more features are added to the system, the higher the price of the machine will be.       Alarm systems may also vary in how they are turned off. While some can be turned off simply by pressing a button on a key chain, others must be physically manipulated for the alarm to stop.       Those who are not familiar with alarm systems may want to purchase a package which allows for the installation of the product by the retailer. While this additional feature can be pricey, it is well worth it for those who are not mechanically oriented.    The cost of repairing a damaged car can be quite high for insurance companies. Due to these high costs, some insurance companies are now providing incentives for customers to purchase and install car alarm systems, such as lower insurance rates. With a lower car insurance premium, a higher-priced and more complex alarm system may be more affordable.    As discussed previously, good alarm systems can be found at any price. Similarly, alarm systems which are not as effective can also range in price. Read up on the system you are considering before making a purchase. In addition, research the warranties provided by various systems before settling on a particular product. Speaking with car repair shops and car insurance professionals can also help you evaluate the quality of various products. These individuals deal with car repairs on a daily basis, and should be able to provide an unbiased opinion on the systems.    Once you have finally settled on a particular machine, start hunting for deals. Depending on the stores you visit, the cost of a particular style and brand can be quite different. Read local newspapers and check online websites to determine if any upcoming adds can save you money on the car alarm system you have decided to purchase.	Determine how much money you can spend. Consider which features you want in your alarm system. Talk to your insurance provider regarding alarm system subsidies. Evaluate the quality of the car alarm systems you are considering. Shop around before making a purchase to find the best price. Finished.
Get involved in the lives of your children, parents, siblings and other members of your immediate family. Call them up regularly to check in and schedule time to hang out. Spend some time each day interacting with your family.   You might even plan a family reunion.  In addition to family, spend time with friends as well. If possible, avoid going to the movies or over to their house to watch a show. Instead, plan dinners, mini vacations to the beach, or trips to the bowling alley or skating rink., Beyond your family and friends, there are likely many others that you interact with on a day to day basis like the janitor who works in your office, the lunch lady in your school, or your coworkers. Instead of tuning them out or putting in your headphones, engage with them in conversation. This will help you stay more connected to the real world., Take a good look around you and attend to any household duties that may need to be taken care of. This can include anything from fixing a leaking tap to fixing up the garden. Improving your cooking or cuisine skills is also another option to consider.  Register for any courses that you are interested in or even consider going back to school. This will make a great and significant demand on your time. This will also keep you occupied and productive., There are many other activities to engage in besides television. Spend some time exploring old hobbies of yours and developing new ones. You can do things like read, ride horses, dance, or garden., There is a whole exciting world outside of your home that you have likely not explored because of your TV addiction. Get out in your neighborhood and take a walk. Go hiking or camping with friends. Get out on the lake and go canoeing or kayaking. These activities are good for both physical and mental health.	Interact with family. Spend time with friends. Practice mindfulness in all interactions. Take care of your home. Take a class. Choose another hobby. Get outdoors.
Use the same color as the pipe cleaner used for the body. To shape the wings:   Bend two more pipe cleaners into U shapes at each end, using the middle of the pipe cleaner as the dividing point for each U shape. Then, slightly kink the middle of the pipe cleaner, as shown. Reshape the U shapes into as wing-like a shape as possible.  To do this, wrap or fold the loose ends slightly around the body of the dragonfly, just enough to attach without taking away the wing shape. Make readjustments to the wing shape as needed.   For added effect, try pasting some colored tissue paper over the wings.  The dragonfly can now be displayed by hanging using invisible thread. Or simply place it on a shelf or add to a craft project.   If wearing as jewelry, attach a finding such as a brooch backing, using craft glue. Other uses include: Adding to a collage or picture, toys for children over 3, decorations on children's lunchboxes/bags/totes/water bottles, etc., attachments to gift cards or gift wrapping, a decoration for a small treasures box lid, etc.	Take two pipe cleaners to use for the long and graceful wings of the dragonfly. Twist the wings into position on the body. Display the dragonfly.

Rather than planting an entire crop of seeds at once, plant them in stages over the course of several weeks. This enables you to harvest in stages, and therefore consume the produce over time, rather than all at once. Succession planting allows a constant harvest in your garden, reducing the chance of produce waste.	Plant produce in stages.
It should not wobble or there is a risk of hot wax pouring out. Either put on a plate or stand or place on a flat surface that cannot burn, such as a bowl of sand.	Always ensure that the candle is sitting flat before lighting. Light the wick and burn as for any candle.
How to care for your plant will depend on what climate you live in and how you wish the plant to look. Roses in zones 4 and 5 (where temperatures dip to -30 degrees F and -34.4 degrees C) may need protection during the winter. Consider planting your roses near covered areas and bushes.   Roses in the hotter zones will need shade to protect them from wilting in the summer heat.  Plant your rose in a sheltered area with moderate sun. Since Lenton roses prefer alkaline soiland areas near trees and large plants, look for a spot where shrubs and bushes grow naturally. Such spots may be near a large tree, in the corner of the garden, or near a pond.  Alkaline soil with a pH of 7.6 to 8.5 is ideal for Lenton roses. Buy a soil pH test kit at your local garden center and test the pH of your soil. Be sure to use soil that you dig up from 4 inches (10.2 cm) below the surface to get a good sample. Wear gloves while collecting your soil. Touching the sample with your hands could influence the pH. Break up the soil and allow it to dry.   Put the dried soil into a clean container. Put distilled water and the chemical that comes in the test kit into the container with the soil. Shake up the container then and then let the soil settle. Check the color of the water in the container against the chart that comes with the kit to determine what the pH of your soil is.  The amount of lime necessary depends on the texture of the soil and how much the pH needs to be changed. If the soil is sandy, 1 ¼ pounds of lime will be required to change the pH of 25 square feet of soil from 6.8 to 7.8. Heavy clay soil will require 2 ¾ pounds of lime to make the same change.   Work the lime into the soil to a depth of 6 inches (15.2 cm) if the Lenton rose has not already been planted. If it is already growing in the garden, gently work the lime into the top few inches of soil around the plant.  Lenton roses grow best in organically rich, fertile soil that drains quickly. If the Lenton rose has not yet been planted, work a 3- to 6-inch depth of organic matter like well-aged cow manure, compost, sphagnum peat moss or leaf mold into the soil. Work it in thoroughly to a depth of 8 to 10 inches (20.3 to 25.4 cm).   If the Lenton rose has already been planted, gently work the organic matter into the top 4 to 6 inches (10.2 to 15.2 cm) of soil around the rose. Be careful not to damage its roots. The organic matter will improve the texture, fertility and drainage capabilities of the soil.  Dig a hole twice the size of the plant. Place a layer of peat moss in the hole and then place the roots directly above the moss. The plant have at least three inches of topsoil over its roots to help it survive during the winter months.   Leave the stem clear when returning the soil to the hole. This will encourage growth while discouraging diseases from affecting your rose.	Consider your environment. Select a site that gets moderate amounts of sun. Test the pH of your soil. Add lime to the soil to make it more alkaline if the pH is too low. Add organic matter to your soil. Dig a hole for your rose.
When it comes to obtaining seeds for your cactus, you have two options: buying seeds from a gardening store or supplier or picking your own from a cactus that you already have at your disposal. Here, you are essentially choosing between price and convenience — store-bought seeds are cheap and pre-packaged, while self-picked seeds are free but require a little more work.   If you're buying seeds, you shouldn't have too much trouble finding them for sale. Many brick-and-mortar garden supply stores sell cactus seeds, while online shopping sites can allow you to effortlessly browse hundreds of varieties before ordering. If, on the other hand, you want to pick your own seeds, start by finding the seed pods or fruits on your cactus. Usually, these are brightly-colored offshoots of the main cactus body which bear a flower. When the flower falls off, the pod or fruit is ripe and is ready to be harvested (assuming it has been pollinated).; , Remove the pods or fruits from the cactus before they dry out. The pods should not be full of moisture but should still be damp to the touch inside. The seeds themselves, which are inside the pod or fruit can vary in appearance from cactus to cactus. Some seeds will be discrete black or reddish dots clearly visible from one another, while other seeds can be so small as to appear like sand or dust.          "Ripe" pods with mature seeds should come off with a slight twist of the hand, leaving the interior fiber/cotton on the cactus. If the pod does not come off easily, it is not ready to be removed.  Once you've removed all of the mature pods from your cactus, it's time to remove the seeds themselves from the pods. Begin by using a sharp knife to slice the tops off of the pods. Next, slice down one side of the pod to expose the seeds. Finally, remove the seeds by carefully scraping them from the inside of the pod.          Obtaining the seeds from tropical varieties of cactus can be different than obtaining the seeds from a desert cactus, but the general concept is the same — remove the fruit from the plant and open it up to expose the seeds. For example, the seeds of a Christmas Cactus, a type of tropical cactus, can be harvested by removing the blueberry-like fruit and squeezing or tearing it open to produce small black seeds., Whether you bought seeds or harvested them from an existent cactus, you'll want to plant them in clean, shallow containers filled with suitable soil. Moisten the soil thoroughly before planting but do not allow any standing water to remain. Next, spread the seeds across the top of the soil (don't bury them). Finally, lightly cover the seeds with a very thin layer of soil or sand. Cactus seeds only have a small amount of stored energy and if planted too deeply will not reach the surface before they run out.          Cacti require well-draining soil, especially desert varieties that are vulnerable to diseases from standing water. Try a mix of ⅓ compost, ⅓ horticultural sand, and ⅓ perlite.If the soil you use for planting hasn't been pasteurized (it should say whether or not on the packaging), you may want to consider heating it in the oven at 300o F (about 150o C) for half an hour. This kills any pests or pathogens in the soil.  Once you've moistened the soil and planted your cactus seeds, cover the container with a transparent lid (like plastic wrap) and place it in a location where the seeds will receive a good amount of sun — a sunny window is a good location. Sunlight should not be intense and constant, but should be strong for at least a few hours each day. The transparent lid will retain moisture in the container as the cactus begins to sprout while allowing light to reach the cactus.          Be patient as you wait for your cactus to germinate. Depending on the species of cactus you are growing, germination can take anywhere from several weeks to several months.Tropical cacti are used to the shady environment under the jungle canopy and thus generally require less sun than desert cacti. You can usually get away with growing a tropical cactus in a brightly-lit spot that receives no direct sunlight. For instance, hanging pots under a shaded awning are a great location for tropical cacti.  While desert cacti in their natural environment are routinely exposed to extreme temperature swings (from extremely hot during the day to extremely cold at night), tropical cacti enjoy balmy, consistently warm weather. Thus, it's a wise idea to grow tropical cacti in locations where they won't experience intense, direct sunlight during the day or chilly cold at night. Try to keep tropical cacti at a temperature of roughly 70-75o F (21-24o C) — greenhouses are great for this.          If you don't live in the tropics, you'll probably need to grow your tropical cacti indoors, where temperature and access to sunlight is much easier to control.  In the weeks after you plant your new cactus seeds, your seedling should begin to germinate. Cacti typically grow fairly slowly, so this can take a month or more.Eventually, you should be able to see the first tiny emergence of your cactus's spines. When this happens, start giving your cactus a chance to breathe by removing the transparent cover during the day. As the cactus grows, you may leave the cover off for longer periods of time until the plant is well-established and no longer needs the cover.          It's worth noting, however, that this will increase the rate at which water evaporates from the soil. This means that you'll need to start watering. Try to do so cautiously — don't let the soil dry out completely, but don't ever leave standing water in the container from over-watering. Note that many tropical cacti won't have spines, so in this case simply remove the cover once the seedling sprouts up through the soil.  As noted above, cacti grow fairly slowly. Depending on the type of cactus you have, it should take about 6 months to 1 year to grow to roughly the size of a large marble.At this point, it's a wise idea to repot the cactus in a different container. Like most potted plants, keeping a cactus in a container that's too small for it can cause the plant to become nutrient-starved, inhibiting its growth and even killing it.          To repot your cactus, use sturdy gloves or a spade to remove the entire plant, roots and all, from its growing medium. Place it in a new, larger container with a the same type of soil, pack the soil around the cactus, and water.  As the visible, above-ground portion of your cactus grows, its roots will as well. As your cactus becomes larger and larger, which can take years, it may need to be repotted multiple times. However, because the transplantation process can be stressful for plants, it's important that you allow your cactus to "recover" after each time you repot it. Instead of keeping the repotted cactus in a location where it receives a good amount of sunlight, try keeping it in a shaded or partially-shaded area until its roots re-establish. Gradually re-introduce the cactus to sun over a period of a month or so.  Established cacti have less vigorous watering requirements than most other potted plants. Though they do require some water, their reputation as hardy desert survivors is well-earned. Most varieties of desert cactus require little water once they're fully established. Though individual species of cactus may differ in the amount of water they require, a good general rule is to let the soil dry out completely before watering. Depending on the temperature, this mean waiting a month or longer between waterings.          Remember that cacti experience slow, gradual growth. Thus, they don't need very much water. Watering more frequently than is necessary can lead to to problems for the plant, including root disorders that can cause the eventual death of the plant. Tropical cacti are something of an exception to this rule, as they are naturally acclimatized to more humid environments than desert cacti. While you can get away with a little more watering if you have a tropical cactus, you should still wait until the soil dries out before each new watering.  Though cacti grow slowly, their growth can be supplemented during the growing months of spring and summer with the light application of fertilizer or plant food. Cacti generally require less fertilizer than other plants — try using a dilute solution of liquid fertilizer once a month. Mix a small quantity of liquid fertilizer with an equal volume of water. Use this mixture to water your cactus every second or third watering.          The precise amount of fertilizer you should use can vary based on both the species of cactus you are growing and its size. Specific information should be on the fertilizer's packaging.  One of the most common problems when it comes to potted plants is fungal rot (also called root rot). This affliction typically occurs when the roots of a plant are held in contact with moisture that is unable to properly drain, which becomes stagnant and encourages fungal growth. This can happen to most potted plants, but desert cacti are especially susceptible as they naturally require only a small amount of water compared to other plants. The best cure for rot is a preventative one: simply avoid over-watering in the first place. As a general rule, it's better to under-water than to over-water when it comes to cacti. You'll also want to use a good-quality potting soil with a high level of drainage for all cacti.          If your plant has rot, it may appear swollen, soft, brownish, and/or decayed, with the possibility of splits in its surface. Often, but not always, this condition moves from the bottom of the plant up. The options for treating rot after it has set in are limited. You can try to remove the cactus from its pot, cut away any slimy, blackened roots and any dead tissue above ground, and re-plant it in a new container with clean soil. However, if the damage to the roots is extensive, it may die anyway. In many cases, it's necessary to discard plants with rot to prevent the spread of the fungus to other adjacent plants., Etiolation is a condition in which a plant experiences pale, sickly growth because it is not exposed to enough light. Cacti with etiolated growth will often have a thin, flimsy quality and a pale, light-green color. The etiolated portion of the plant will grow towards a nearby light source, if there are any. While etiolation is permanent in the sense that any sickly growth that has already occurred cannot be reversed, future etiolation can be curbed by ensuring the plant receives a sufficient amount of sunlight.          However, you won't want to throw a cactus with etiolated growth into intense, direct sunlight immediately. Instead, gradually increase the amount of sun the plant receives each day until you notice that its growth has become normal. Exposing any plant to drastically increased sunlight can be stressful for the plant, while exposing an etiolated cactus to such levels of sunlight can be fatal.  If you've ever noticed that you've gotten an especially-bad sunburn after being in water, you've experienced something similar to phototoxicity, a harmful malady that can affect your plant. After applying an oil-based pesticide to a plant, the oil from the pesticide remains on the surface of the plant, acting as a sort of "tanning lotion" by increasing the intensity of the sun's rays. This can cause the portions of the plant on which the oil is present to become burnt, grey, and dried-out. To prevent this, place the cactus in a shaded location for a few days until the oil-based pesticide has done its work before returning it to the sun.  One aspect of the cactus life cycle with which most people are not familiar is the process of "corking", in which the bottom portions of a mature cactus slowly start to develop a tough, brown, bark-like exterior. Though this condition can appear serious because it replaces the natural green exterior with one that appears dead, it's not actually a sign that the plant is in any danger and can usually be ignored.          Natural corking usually starts at the base of the plant and can slowly creep upwards. If the corking starts elsewhere on the plant, this can be a sign of a problem. For instance, if the top of the cactus and the side facing the sun bear this weathered appearance but the base of the cactus does not, this can be a sign that the cactus is receiving too much sun, rather than the result of natural corking.	Pick seed pods from existent cacti or buy commercial seeds. If harvesting seeds from cactus pods, gather the pods. Next, harvest the seeds from the pods. Plant the seeds in high-drainage soil. Cover the container and expose it to sun. Keep tropical cacti at a steady, warm temperature. When the first spines show, allow the plant to ventilate. Repot your cacti when they are well-established. Allow cacti to recover from repotting in the shade. Water infrequently. Fertilize young plants during the growing months. Prevent rot by avoiding over-watering. Gradually increase exposure to sunlight to treat etiolation. Avoid phototoxicity by limiting sun exposure after using pesticides. Don't be frightened by natural "corking".

A theremin is basically a box with two antennas, one of which controls the pitch of the instrument, the other of which controls the volume. These antennas create electromagnetic fields which are "played" by manipulating them with the hands. Coils of tight-pack wire act as oscillators, producing signals fed into the antennae.While it may seem like spooky magic, the fields are created by relatively straightforward circuitry. A theremin involves the following components, most of which you should be able to purchase at electronics supply:   Pitch-reference oscillator Pitch-control oscillator Mixer Volume-control oscillator Volume-resonant circuit and voltage-controlled amplifier Audio amplifier 12-volt power supply; , Building a theremin from scratch isn’t a project for a weekender with a love for spooky sounds. If you want to build one easily and cheaply, buy a kit, follow the instructions and put it together. If you want to wire your own, there’s a lot you need to learn to do first. Even if you want to put together a theremin, it’s likely that you’ll need to understand how to read a basic schematic. To build a theremin, you need to know how to:   Read an electronic schematic Solder electronics Wire a potentiometer Wire a circuit If you want to put a theremin together, kits are available at a variety of different price ranges, some of them relatively easy to put together and some more complex. It's somewhat easier than starting from scratch and getting all the boards and circuits you'll need individually. Unless you're an experienced maker of circuits, it'll be difficult, though not impossible, to make your own theremin without a kit., Find or construct a box big enough to house the theremin's internal circuitry. A professional theremin, the type of which can be played comfortably, should be large enough to stand in front of, your arms held shoulder-width apart, about 24 inches (61 cm) wide for most adults.   The top should be hinged so you can install the components and make adjustments when necessary. Kits are available for this purpose, which can be a good idea to get the basic housing shape, even if you still want to customize the circuitry.  A monopole antenna for pitch needs to be attached to the top of the box and a similar antenna for pitch needs to be installed vertically. A loop antenna used to control the volume will be attached to the side of the box. The looping antenna is sometimes a somewhat more difficult device to find, but should be available at specialty electronics stores.   While it may seem like it's more important to wire the circuits first, it's much easier to get the housing in place before you start worrying about the circuitry, to make sure that everything is spaced accurately and comfortably to play. Just as you'd build the guitar's body before wiring the pickups, you want to start with the housing. You're making an instrument, not a radio.  The pitch of a theremin is controlled by creating a circuit between a variable oscillator and a reference oscillator, which should be available at specialty electronics stores as individual units. Each should be tuned to the same frequency, ideally in the middle of the low frequency radio range.   The pitch-reference oscillator should work around 172kHz, used in conjunction with a 10k potentiometer. The signal this oscillator creates should be fed into the mixer with screened cable. The pitch-variable oscillator should also work around 172khz, and will be affected by the stray capacitance of the reference unit.Potentiometers need to be wired into the circuit to make the relationship of your hand movement to the change in pitch more linear. Without them, the instrument's pitch be almost impossible to control, changing wildly with only a microscopic movement of the hand.  Using screened cable, wire the circuit of the pitch control components into the antenna when you're finished. When playing the theremin, your hand changes the capacitance of the antenna, which will change the frequency of the variable oscillator. Essentially, you're sending the signal into the antenna to be manipulated manually.  This should also be in the low frequency radio range and carefully tuned, operating somewhere in the neighborhood of 441kHz. This signal will be influenced directly by the volume antenna, manipulating it by hand. A 10k trim potentiometer needs to be installed to enable the operator to tune the theremin appropriately.   Send the output of this variable oscillator into a volume resonant circuit. The output will be a DC voltage that varies according to the output of the variable oscillator. Tuned correctly, the oscillator frequency will match the tuning of the volume-resonant circuit as the operator's hand approaches the antenna, causing the signal to cut off gradually. In other words, the closer the hand to the antenna, the quieter the sound.  The purpose of the mixer is to compare the frequency of the variable oscillator with the reference frequency. The output will be an audio signal between 20Hz and 20kHz. Assembling the mixer is the simplest step in the process. Fed with two slightly different frequencies from the oscillators, the mixer will produce an output with a complex waveform, giving it the distinctive warble we associate with the sci-fi sound of the theremin.   The output actually contains two distinct frequencies, which require the need of a low pass filter, that is two 0.0047uF capacitors and a 1k resistor, used to extract the output and boost it into a listenable range.  Route the outputs of the mixer and the volume resonant circuit into a voltage-controlled amplifier. The voltage from the volume resonant circuit changes the amplitude of the audio signal from the mixer, helping to boost the sound and control the volume of the instrument.  Send the output of the voltage controlled amplifier into an audio amplifier and then a speaker to amplify the sound created by the electromagnetic fields as you manipulate them. In a pinch, you can use the internal components or a guitar amp you connect to the theremin with a jack installed in the back of the case.  You should need a power converter that operates at about 12 volts to power a basic theremin with this assembly. You can build a step-down transformer that will convert the normal house voltage or buy a power cord with a built in converter.   Use extreme caution if you're not an experienced electrician. There's a fairly serious amount of voltage going through these circuits, and fire or injury can result from mistakes. Brush up on the skills outlined at the beginning of this article before trying to wire these circuits and apply them to power.  If you're going to take the time to build a theremin from scratch, it's important to tune it accurately and make sure that you've got a playable prototype. Each module should be built, tested, and tuned so that the final assembly is the simple process of hooking everything together and performing a few final adjustments.   In order to test and tune the modules, hook your theremin into the input jacks on an oscilloscope and you'll be able to see the sound waves you're creating as you manipulate the theremin. Adjust the modules accordingly, if the sound waves are off.  It's important to work from a detailed schematic and brush up on the skills necessary to circuit-wiring if you're going to undertake a DIY theremin project. Tons of schematics, tips, and tricks of the theremin-building trade are available online. You can learn more about building theremins with the community of ThereminWorld.

The Captain usually sits in the left seat where the concentration of instruments are (especially for light single engine aircraft). Fasten your seat-belt and shoulder harness if so equipped. However, almost all aircraft have dual controls and you can successfully land the plane from either side. Do not touch the controls yet! The autopilot will most likely be engaged. Leave it on for now.   Make sure the unconscious pilot is not leaning on the control yoke (the plane's equivalent of a steering wheel). Some aircraft may have a side stick, which will be a joystick to the left of the captain's seat.; , You'll probably be overwhelmed with the sensory overload and the seriousness of the situation. Remembering to breathe will help you focus. Take a slow, deep inhalation to tell your body you're in control.  If the plane is noticeably ascending, descending, or turning, gently bring the plane into a level flight altitude using the outside horizon as your guide. Finally, all those days of joystick video games are about to pay off!   Look for the attitude indicator. Sometimes called the artificial horizon, it consists of a miniature set of "wings" and a picture of the horizon. The top is blue (for the sky) and the bottom is brown. On some complex aircraft, the attitude indicator is displayed on a computer screen in front of the pilot. For older aircraft, it is in the center of the top row of instruments. On modern-day airliners, there will be a Primary Flight Display (PFD) directly ahead of you. This displays vital information such as Indicated Airspeed (IAS) measured in knots, Ground Speed (GS), also measured in knots, altitude (measured in feet) and heading. It should also display whether or not the autopilot is engaged, usually denoted by AP or CMD. Correct the pitch (climb or descent) and bank (turning) if necessary so that the miniature wings are level with the artificial horizon. If they are already level, do not touch the controls at all; move to the next step. If you do need to level the plane, however, adjust the flight attitude by pulling the yoke (or stick) toward you to bring the nose up or push it forward to lower the nose. You can correct bank (turning) by rotating the yoke or stick left or right to turn in that direction. Simultaneously, you must apply slight back pressure to the yoke to prevent the airplane from losing altitude.  If you have been trying to correct the flight path, the autopilot is probably disengaged. Turn it on by pushing buttons labeled "AUTOPILOT" or "AUTO FLIGHT," "AFS" or "AP" or something alike. On passenger airplanes it is situated in the center of the glare-shield panel, in a position where both pilots can easily reach it. On most flights during cruise stage, the autopilot is already on.   Only if this results in the aircraft doing things you do not want it to do, disengage it again by pushing all buttons you can find on the yoke (which then probably will include the autopilot disconnect button). Usually the best way to get an aircraft to fly in a stabilized way is to not touch the controls; it is designed to be stable and most people who are not trained pilots tend to over-control the plane.  Look for a hand-held microphone, which is normally to the left of the pilot’s seat just below the side window, and use it like a CB radio. Find the microphone or take the pilot's headset, press and hold the button, and repeat "Mayday" three times followed by a brief description of your emergency (pilot unconscious, etc.). Remember to release the button to hear a response. An airport flight controller will help you fly the plane to a safe landing. Listen carefully and answer their questions to the best of your abilities so they can better assist you.   Alternatively, you can take the pilot's headset and press the push-to-talk (PTT) button, which is on the yoke. However, so is the autopilot button, and if you press it by accident, you could mess with the autopilot system. Stick with the hand-held radio.Attempt to call for assistance on the frequency you are currently on. - This is where the pilot was already communicating with someone only moments prior. Use the words "May-Day, May-Day" at the beginning of your call. If that fails after repeated attempts, and if you know how to change the radio frequencies with certainty, you can call for help on 121.50 MHz.  If you see a red light on the panel illuminated, tell the controller. Below the red light, there will a description of the light, e.g., Generator, Low Voltage. Obviously this requires prompt attention.   If you can find the Transponder on the radio stack (it has four windows of 4 numbers from 0-7, usually located near the bottom of the stack), set it to 7700. This is an emergency code that will quickly alert air traffic controllers that you have an emergency.  The airplane's call sign is located on the panel (unfortunately, there's no standard location, but the call sign should be somewhere on the panel). Call signs for airplanes registered in the United States start with the letter "N" (e.g., "N12345"). "N" can be confused with other letters over a radio, so say "November." Announcing the call will clearly identify the aircraft and will also give the flight controllers important information about the airplane so they can better help you land it.   If you are on a commercial aircraft (an aircraft operated by an airline, such as United, American, US Airways, etc.) the aircraft is not referred to by its "N" number. It is instead called by its call-sign, or the flight number. Sometimes pilots will put a sticky note on the panel to remind them. Ask a flight attendant what the flight number is. When you call on the radio, say the airline's name first, then say the number. If the flight number is 123 and you are flying United, your call-sign would be "United 1-2-3". Do not read the numbers like a normal number, so do not say "United One-hundred twenty three."  , Look for the airspeed indicator (usually labeled ASI, Airspeed or Knots) usually located toward the upper left of the instrument panel, and keep an eye on your speed. Speeds are either in MPH or Knots (similar values). Do not fly a small 2-seater less than 70 knots. Do not fly a large (Jumbo) less than 180 knots. Ultimately, just make sure the needle stays in the "green" zone for normal flight, until you can get someone on the radio to help.   If the airspeed starts increasing, and you haven't touched the throttle, you're probably going down, so pull back gently on the control yoke. If the airspeed is decreasing, gently push the nose down to increase the speed. Do not let the aircraft fly too slowly, especially near the ground. It may stall (the wing no longer produces lift).  The controller you are talking to should brief you on the landing procedures for the aircraft and direct you to a safe spot to land. They will most likely line you up with the runway at an airport, but under rare circumstances you may have to land in a field or road. If you must land and can't get to an airport, avoid places with power lines, trees, or other obstacles.   To start reducing the plane's altitude, pull back the throttle (to reduce power) until you hear the sound of the engines change - then stop. The throttle levers are almost always located in between the Captain and First Officer's seat. Otherwise, it may be mounted on the ceiling in the center, close to the windscreen. It's impossible to generalize, but this probably shouldn't be more than ¼" (0.6 cm) or so of throttle travel. Keep the airspeed within the green arc. The nose of the aircraft should drop on its own without pushing forward on the yoke. If you find you are constantly pushing or pulling on the yoke to keep the airplane steady, you have to use trim to relieve those pressures. Otherwise, it can get very tiring and/or distracting. The trim wheel is typically a wheel approximately 6–8 inches (15.2–20.3 cm) in diameter that rotates in the same direction as the landing gear wheels. It is often located near your knees on either side. It is black and has small bumps on the outside edges. As you hold pressure against the yoke, gently turn the trim wheel. If the pressure you are holding gets greater, turn the wheel in the other direction until you no longer have to maintain the original level of pressure. Note: On some small airplanes, the trim wheel may be found on the headliner and in the shape of a crank. Also, on some larger aircraft the trim is in the form of a switch on the yoke (control stick). It is usually on the left near the top. If the aircraft is pushing the yoke towards you, then push the lever down. If it is pulling away, push the lever up.  You'll be using a variety of drag devices (slats and flaps, next to the throttles) to slow the plane down without losing lift. Get the landing gear down, if it's retractable. If the gear is fixed, it's always down and you don't need to do anything. The gear handle (the end of the handle is shaped like a tire) is usually just to the right of the center console, above where the knee of the co-pilot would be. If you need to land on water, though, leave the landing gear up.   On most large, commercial aircraft, there will be a GPWS (or EGPWS for Airbus) system. What it does is when you reach a certain altitude (usually 2500, 1000, 500-100, 50-5), it will call out that altitude. It will also say "Approaching Minimums" and "Minimums". "Approaching Minimums" means you are 100 feet from approaching "Minimums", depending on what kind of approach you are executing. When "Minimums" sounds, you should check if the runway and/or the approach lights are in sight. If not, you must engage the TO/GA mode and execute a missed approach. (If you can't find the TO/GA button, just put the throttle to full). Be sure to activate the autobrake and arm the spoilers (if any) if possible. Look for the autobrake knob, it's location will vary from aircraft to aircraft. The spoilers ensure a firm landing and reduce the chance of you flying up in the air when you flare. Beware of crosswind. If there's a crosswind, then you must counter it by pushing going into a "crab" position. A "crab" is where your nose is pointing more or less in the direction of the where the wind is coming from. Generally, you want to experiment with the crab until you get the perfect angle to continue the approach. Use the rudder pedals if necessary. Just before you touch down, you'll need to raise the nose to flare and land on the main wheels first. A flare is typically 5-7 degrees in a small aircraft with 60-70 knots, depending on your weight. In some larger aircraft, a flare may mean up to 15 degrees of nose up, with 140-150 knots, once again depending on your weight. In a small general aviation aircraft, flare at 5-10 feet. On a small narrow-body airliner, flare at 10-15 feet. On a large, wide-body aircraft like the 777 or A380, you should start initiating your flare no lower than 20 feet. If you flare too high, you will float down the runway, causing you to use up more runway, and sometimes causes you to have a hard landing due to the plane slowing down while floating. You MUST retard the throttle (put it to idle) just before your flare. If flying a large commercial aircraft, activate your reverse thrust, if the plane has it. On Boeing aircraft, there are bars behind the throttle quadrant. Pull the bars back all the way and the thrust will be directed forward to aid in stopping the aircraft. If all else fails, pull the throttle back as fast and far as possible. If there's a crosswind and you're misaligned with the runway, it may be a good idea to only activate one reverse thrust to realign the plane, then activate the next one once you are on the centerline. Reduce power to idle by pulling the throttle all the way back, until you reach the sign labeled idle. It is normally a black lever usually located between the pilot and co-pilot. Gently apply the brakes by pressing on top of the rudder pedals. Use enough pressure to stop the plane without skidding. The rudder pedals themselves are used to steer the plane on the ground, so don't use them unless the plane is veering off the runway.  Once you get some help for the unconscious pilot, you can finally faint. Go ahead, you earned it. And if you can ever stand to see another airplane, let alone get on one, you just may have "the right stuff" and should consider taking flight lessons from a certified instructor. Then again, maybe not. Just write a book about it.	Take a seat. Take a breather. Level the aircraft. Turn on autopilot. Call for help on the radio. Use the airplane call sign when you talk with the controller. Maintain a safe speed. Begin the descent. Go for landing. Congratulate yourself.
The sinking brake pedal often does mean the brake lines need to be bled. However, it is very important to confirm that the sinking pedal is not caused by something else.   Try this simple test when you are stopped and waiting at a red light. With your foot, keep an even pressure on the brake pedal. Does the pedal sink lower, even a little bit? If so, then you should have your car's brake system inspected by an ASE Certified Master Auto Technician to confirm the root cause is not something else. If the pedal holds constant pressure, then there is no air in the system. A sinking brake pedal could also be caused by other things that could be very dangerous. For example, brake pedals can also sink if there is a hydraulic problem, like a failing master cylinder, a leaking rear wheel cylinder, a bad caliper or bad ABS. So it is important to rule out these dangerous possibilities via professional inspection before proceeding.; , Cars with automatic transmissions should be in park and those with standard transmissions should be in first gear. The emergency (or parking) brake should be on at all times.  Remove all four wheels.  It's a fist size (or larger) transparent container that is bolted to the firewall on the driver’s side of the car. It will be connected to an aluminum object the has metal tubes coming out of its sides. These metal lines are the brake lines that direct the hydraulic brake fluid to your individual wheels. There the brake fluid activates either the disc or drum brake components that stop your car.  Fill the Master Cylinder with fresh, clean brake fluid, making sure that it's the proper type for your car. If you have questions, ask the parts person to look up your car's brake fluid when you purchase it.  Using a box-end wrench, loosen the bleeder screw. Take a piece of rubber vacuum hose and put it on to the end of the bleeder screw and put the other end into an empty clear plastic bottle.  Have your partner pump the brakes slowly until the dirty fluid comes out of the brakes lines and into the bottle. Allow enough fluid to exit so that the end of rubber hose is submerged in brake fluid. (Check the Master Cylinder frequently to make sure there is plenty of brake fluid.)  , Close the bleeder screw with the wrench and have your partner pump the pedal 3 times and hold it. Open up the bleeder screw briefly to allow the brake fluid to exit the rubber hose. Have your partner tell you when the brake pedal is on the floor, and, have him/her keep it there while you close the bleeder screw. Repeat this process two more times. (Remember periodically check the Master Cylinder fluid level, so it does not go dry!) After the third time, tighten the bleeder screw and repeat this process on the other three wheels and, in this order; Left Rear, Right Front and Left Front.   Depending on the vehicle, the bleeding procedure will vary in which wheel is bled first, second and so on. The above sequence will work for a large portion of vehicles, however you should check with a website like Alldata or similar to verify bleeding sequence.  With the engine off, have your partner push down on the brake pedal and go around to all four wheels and check for leaks. Then, push the brake pedal with your foot. It should travel about 1–3 inches (2.5–7.6 cm) and stop. The brake pedal should feel very hard at this stopping point.  Remember that brake fluid is considered hazardous waste and therefore should never be poured down the sink or toilet, onto the ground in your yard, in the garbage, or down the sewer drain or septic tank.Talk with your local auto shop or look for a household hazardous waste (HHW) recycling collection site., Lower the vehicle to the ground and properly torque the lug nuts. Replace the hub caps if necessary.  If there are still problems, have your car inspected by an ASE Certified Master Auto Tech.	Confirm you need to bleed the brake lines. Position your car on a flat surface. Take off any hubcaps and raise the car and secure it on jack stands. Release the hood and locate the Master Cylinder brake fluid reservoir. Eliminate the old, dirty brake fluid that is present in the Master Cylinder Reservoir. Go to the right rear wheel, wipe off any dirt from the brake bleeder screw area and remove its rubber dust cap. Hold onto the box wrench while holding the plastic bottle. When the brake fluid becomes clear, direct your partner to hold the pedal to the floor. In order to make sure your brakes are not spongy and there aren't any leaks in the system, perform this test when your are finished bleeding the brakes. Get rid of any surplus brake fluid in a proper and safe manner. Replace all four wheels and hand-tighten all the lug nuts. Go for a test drive to verify that the brakes are functioning correctly.
Hibiscus plants grow with terminal flowers; this means that each flower on a hibiscus plant grows at the end of a branch. Pruning a healthy hibiscus bush will encourage growth and tell the plant to grow more branches, thus producing more flowers. You can also prune a damaged or dying tree to prevent future decay and to promote new, healthy growth.; , Pruning must be timed to line up with the natural growth patterns of the hibiscus plant. You should never prune a hibiscus in the late fall or winter, as this will prevent new growth in the Spring. Exact times will vary depending on your location, but generally full/major prunes should be done in the early spring, with minor pruning done up till the beginning of fall around September.If you keep your hibiscus plants inside during the winter, wait until you move them outside to prune.  To do damage-free pruning, you’ll need to get a very sharp knife, a pair of sharp gardening shears, a pair of sharp lopping shears, and a hand saw for anything too big to be cut with your smaller tools. Sterilize all tools before starting and between pruning each plant, to prevent the spread of disease. You can sterilize with rubbing alcohol, hand sterilizer, or horticultural disinfectant.   Your tools must absolutely be sharp; a dull knife, shears, or saw will cause more harm than good if you try to prune with them. Take the time to sharpen your tools, or buy new ones if yours are too old., Keeping in mind that the location you prune is the location of new growth, you always want to prune your hibiscus on branches facing outwards. You’ll make all cuts ¼-inch from the top of a node (the location of a leaf/twig) at an upwards 45 degree angle. The lower end of each cut should be near the center of the bush, while the higher end of the cut should be nearer to the outside of the bush. This helps water run off the cut surface instead of pooling, which reduces the risk of infection.  Although the amount of the plant that you prune will vary from situation to situation, the general rule is that you should never cut more than ⅔ of any one branch off. Cutting off too much of the plant is no longer considered pruning, but simply damaging the hibiscus.  There are several approaches you can use to prune hibiscus. One light approach is to "pinch" the plant by cutting off just the ends of the branches near the top, so as to stimulate a bit of growth without losing the bulk of the plant. This is the most mild form of pruning, and is the safest for beginners to accomplish. Pinching should be done primarily on young or small plants, as they don’t need much pruning early in their life to promote lots of new growth. Cut the tips of each branch off at the top-most node or higher.  This is the next step up from ‘pinching’ your hibiscus, and involves cutting off larger sections of your plant, but only in certain locations so as to maintain the general size and shape of the bush. In selective pruning, you should find nodes that are ⅓ of the way from the top of the branch, and cut just above these. Do this for most or all of your branches to develop locations for new growth.  Full pruning is the process of cutting back an entire hibiscus plant early in the season, so that you produce the loveliest crop of flowers available. Full prunes are bittersweet, as although they do cause your bush to produce the most flowers, they require cutting back nearly all of the hibiscus plant to start. Cut each branch on the hibiscus bush so that only 2-3 nodes remain per branch. Remember that you should never cut off more than ⅔ of any portion of a branch.  As the name implies, corrective pruning is done when you need to fix an issue on the plant. Typically corrective pruning must be done on damaged or diseased portions of a hibiscus plant. Cut down as far as you must on damaged branches, until green wood is exposed after a cut. If you prune the branch but the wood is hard and white, it is dead and will not recover with new growth.  A hard prune is done only in the most drastic of situations, when a hibiscus bush is nearly entirely dead or damaged. A hard prune involves cutting down all the branches to expose living growth, hopefully causing the plant to start growing again over time. A hard prune may not work if the plant is already dead, but by accomplishing it you’ll at least know what the final state of your hibiscus is.Only hard prune in spring, never at other times of year.

Regardless of the method you use, you want to make sure you remove kudzu at the right times of the year. Kudzu should be treated several times throughout the year.In late spring or early summer, begin your kudzu treatment once the leaves have fully expanded. New kudzu will usually emerge from the first kudzu plants. This should be treated again in later summer or early fall to prevent a reoccurrence.  If you choose to use herbicide to treat kudzu, be careful. Only use herbicide in select areas and only apply the recommended amount. Read instruction manuals that come with your herbicides carefully, especially the safety instructions.Keep away from animals and children. Chemicals in herbicide can be toxic if ingested or touched.  If you're working in residential areas, make sure you choose mild herbicides. You also want to make sure use of herbicides is permitted in any area you choose to spray. You can contact your local Department of Natural Resources for more information.	Remove kudzu during the correct times of year. Use herbicide conservatively. Make sure to use mild herbicides in residential or environmentally sensitive areas.

Some days you just need to relax and de-stress, and a day when you have no obligations weighing on you is a perfect day to enjoy a spa. Start by creating a calming environment by turning out some lights and lighting candles. You can also put on some spa or classical music to further help you relax.You can take many different approaches with your spa day. You can fill up a bath with nicely scented bubble bath and soak in the tub until you are wrinkly, make a facial mask and relax as your pores are cleansed, do a pedicure or manicure (or both!), or apply some homemade facial and body scrub. Use essential oils in your bathtub, in a hot pack for sore muscles, or in a body scrub for more relaxation.  This may not seem relaxing, but when you exercise your body releases endorphins which can improve your mood. Visit your local gym to do some cardio or strength training, or find some workout videos online.

The lid switch is the part on top-loading washing machines, that sends the machine a signal indicating that the door is closed and that it is safe for the machine to run. It should be an oblong hole that is aligned so that a rod on the inside of the door will fit into it.Because this part takes a lot of wear and tear, it is prone to break. Thus, it is one of the most common reasons why washing machines stop at the spin cycle.  You can often guess from appearance and touch whether the lid switch is broken. The switch should be level with the top panel that it is on. If it sags, it is likely broken.   Similarly, you can touch the lid switch to see if the spring underneath is functioning properly. If you press down on the lid switch and it does not give or spring back into place, then there is likely a problem with the lid switch., The process for removing a lid switch depends upon the model of washer. Review the instruction guide for directions on how to remove it or google “remove lid switch” and the model number and serial number for your washing machine. When you remove the lid switch, leave the wires attached.Be sure to unplug the washing machine before unscrewing any components.  Put your multimeter on continuity mode. Find the connector to the lid switch. Unplug it and place the multimeter in the two outer connectors on the lid switch so that they touch the metal inside. Press down on the lid switch and test for continuity.The multimeter should recognize continuity when you press the lid switch down, as would happen if the door were closed, but should not recognize continuity if the button is not pressed down.  Lid switches can be purchased online. They typically cost $10-20. Call your manufacturer and tell them the model number of the washing machine, so that they can direct you to lid switches that are compatible with your machine.  You will need to consult the instructions for your specific model to determine how to replace the lid switch. However, if you have already removed the previous lid switch, it should not be too complicated. You will need to place the new lid switch where the old one had been, screw it in, and connect it to the electronic control board as the old lid switch had been.After the lid switch has been replaced, you will need to reinstall the console and plug the machine back into the wall.	Find the lid switch. Inspect the lid switch. Remove the lid switch. Test the lid switch with a multimeter. Order a new lid switch. Replace your lid switch.
Think about pushing your index finger and thumb together, like you were snapping. Now just put the neck of the guitar between your fingers. You want to be able to squeeze your fingers up against your thumb for the best power, allowing your whole hand -- not just your fretting fingers-- to provide strength.       ; , You don't want to angle it forward because this makes it impossible to push hard on the frets. You don't want to angle it towards your body because this makes it hard to quickly reach the top of the fretboard.  The further away from the fret you are, the harder you have to work in order to hold the string down. You'll be much faster and more efficient if you place your hands right behind the fret. By behind, this means towards the head of the guitar. So, if you're right handed, you want to be just to the left of the fret you're playing.  Your vertical finger placement, or how high you place the tip of your finger when barring chords, will change from person to person. One of the best ways to increase finger strength is to figure out how you can hold all six strings at once and get a clear, consistent sound. Practice quickly barring notes, removing and placing your hand as fast as you can while playing all notes clearly.          The joints in your fingers might make it hard to play some strings. But this is why you need to adjust how high your index finger goes -- don't just assume that you must have the tip of your finger on the top string. Experiment with putting the bar on first, then the shape of the chord, and vice versa. Neither strategy is right -- just find out which method works fastest for you.  You're just going to rotate your finger slightly to make it work. If you're right-handed you'll tilt your hands just slightly to the left, towards the head of the guitar. The harder surface will require less power to hold the string down, making it much easier to get perfect chords and notes quickly.  This takes the weight off of your arm, bringing the weight of the guitar towards the center of your body. With less weight to support, you can easily get more power and speed through your arm. You want to tilt from the wrist, not your elbow. Keep your elbow in, towards you body, instead of flaring it out to the side.  Move your barre up every single fret, picking it up and placing it down. Once you can do this easily, try it with a full barre chord, moving it up and down the neck. This builds the forearm and finger strength needed to play quickly.          If you're struggling at first, try to use a second finger to help hold down your barre. As you gain strength you can take it off.  Once you get barre chords, move on to open chords. Play a G, remove your hand, then play a C. Alternate back and forth, adding new chords in time with the metronome. Then alternate between barre chords and open chords to take your playing to the next level.  While most of your speed comes from practice, there are things you can do to your guitar to make it smoother and easier to play. Getting a guitar serviced by a professional will make practicing more enjoyable, as it makes the strings easier to play. You should consider:           Lower-Guage Strings: This means the strings are thinner, meaning they take less power to hold down and can thus be played faster. Your sound will get slightly tinnier and softer.  Lowering the Action: The action is the distance between the strings and the fretboard. There is little reason for a lot action -- this usually means the guitar is long overdue for servicing.  You might "feel" faster, but you'll never actually know unless you have a metronome to help keep track of time. Keep track of your times and speeds, starting around 60 BPM and moving up when you're comfortable. After running through the exercise a couple times at the previous session's speed, push the tempo faster by ten beats per minute and continue practicing each example until you feel comfortable with the new speed.          Always play at a speed where you can hit every note cleanly, not just hit every note. It doesn't help to play quickly if half the notes are missing.  Using down strokes, up strokes, and alternating strokes, practice this at a tempo that you are able to manage, but fast enough that you cannot do it for long before your fingers tire. Try to do the following exercise, up and down the fretboard, once with up-strokes, once with down strokes, and once with alternating picking: e----------------------------------------5--7-------------- B---------------------------------5--7-------------------- G--------------------------5--7--------------------------- D-------------------5--7---------------------------------- A------------5--7----------------------------------------- E----5---7------------------------------------------------          , Hammer-ons and pulls-offs are ways to sound notes without actually strumming them. This means you can strum a different note, or just squeeze in an extra note between picking. Both techniques use your fretting hand to sound out notes right on the           Hammer-Ons are when you quickly slam your finger down on a string, right near the fret. You should hit it hard enough that it sounds out. It will be a bit quieter than a normally picked note.  Pull-Offs require two fingers on the same string -- try your index on the 5th fret and your ring finger on the 7th. Keeping your finger on the 5th fret, pick up your ring finger, "picking" the string with your ring finger at the 7th fret.  Using Both: Pick a note normally, using your index finger on the 5th fret. Then hammer down on the 7th fret to make it sound out. As you finish, pull-off the 7th fret -- you've only picked one string, but you've sounded out three notes!  , As always, try to play with an accurate tempo and clean articulation. You want each note to be clean, clear, and precise. The fastest playing in the world sounds terrible if every other note is missed or off.  Take the following exercise only as quickly as you do it without mistakes. Make sure you use a metronome to keep yourself on time. As soon as you get to the end, turn back and do the whole thing backward again -- you need to get speed and strength moving both directions. As you get better, work on new picking patterns, add hammer-ons, and make the metronome faster. e|--------------------------------------------------------------5-6-7-8----- B|---------------------------------------------------5-6-7-8--------------- G|---------------------------------------5-6-7-8--------------------------- D|----------------------------5-6-7-8-------------------------------------- A|-----------------5-6-7-8------------------------------------------------- E|-----5-6-7-8-------------------------------------------------------------	Use your thumb to push on the back of the fretboard, clamping your fingers together powerfully. Keep your wrist relaxed, with the back of your hand facing the floor. Place your finger right behind the fret when playing. Find your personal perfect "height" for barre chords, holding all six strings at once with one finger. Tilt your fingers slightly to use the bony area on the side of your finger. Drop your elbow down, keeping it in towards your body. Picking it up after every fret, barre all six strings and move up and down the neck. Alternate between two chords, slowly picking up speed, to work on quick chord transitions and power. Get your guitar serviced to fit your strength and play style. Practice with a metronome to ensure you're actually improving your speed. Alternate your picking, moving up and down across strings. Use hammer-ons and pull-offs to play more complicated licks with speed. Aim for a speed where you can play notes perfectly, not quickly with mistakes. Run through the following pattern using all of your fingers to work on single-note speed.
Where would your character live or act? Does your villain prefer a dark evil lair full of technological doodads, or do they want to live in a shadowed, dark, cave that is full of shadows? Or do you want to go against conventions and show them living happily with a family or give them a sense of humour that appeals to the viewer.  Use props to externalize how the character is feeling.  If it's a softer, kinder character who is much less concerned about how he or she looks than other aspects of life, use very little makeup in flesh-colored or very light tones. If your character is extremely outgoing and likes to stand out in the crowd, try bolder colors, especially on the lips our around the eyes. If you are going for a completely costume- y look, such as designing an alien or superhuman, your stylist should be extremely dramatic so that the effects will pick up well during filming.  This technique is called pathetic fallacy where you use the weather to externalize how a character is feeling. For example rain is used to connote sorrow, sunshine happiness and a storm to suggest anger or rage.	Decide on location. Props. Choose the clothing/hairstyling/makeup that each character needs. Weather.
If you have a smaller space, you'll want to limit your guest list so that everyone can be comfortable while marathon-ing. You'll be engaged in your Potter-viewing mission for about 20 hours, likely longer with breaks, so you'll want to be sure that everyone has a comfortable seat and a clear view of the screen., You could simply choose a day on the weekend when your friends are free to host your party, or you might want to pick a date that references the Harry Potter universe. For example, you might have your party on September third at 4:00 PM, since Harry boards the Hogwarts express on platform 9 (September is the ninth month) and ¾. (which represents the third day at four o'clock)., Twenty hours is a long time to watch anything, even something that you love. You might want to split your marathon into two days and do a half marathon each day, or you might only want to marathon your favorite movies. In any case, write down your general viewing schedule, so you can tell your friends the start and end time of your marathon.   You can add some fun and imagination to your marathon by also making it a theme party. For true, diehard fans who plan on watching the entire series from beginning to end, you should plan a sleepover party. Otherwise, you may have trouble fitting 20 hours of viewing into a single day.  Sitting for long periods of time without moving can be bad for your heath. Think of Harry Potter themed activities you might do to stretch out your body between viewings. This might include:   Pretend dueling Muggle quidditch A Potterverse based board game Potter themed charades or pictionary Potter themed online quizzes  , Due to the combined length of the movies, you'll have to start watching early in the day and end late at night. You might even need to continue watching until the morning of the following day. Include your viewing schedule for your guests on your Potter themed invitation, and don't forget to include the address for the party, the time it starts and ends, and whether or not there will be refreshments.   If you're trying to plan your party on a budget, you might consider making your party a potluck, where everyone brings a dish to pass. This should be clearly indicated on your invitations.Write your invitations on yellowed, parchment style paper so your invites imitate mail in the Potterverse. Purchase this paper at your local craft store or at an art supply store. Use pictures that reference Harry Potter in your invitations. For example, since owls deliver mail in the wizarding world, you might include the picture of an owl on your invitation.  You don't want hunger pangs to interrupt your epic marathon! Think about some popular treats served in the wizarding world, and then do some research online to find recipes for these. You might serve butterbeer or pumpkin juice as drinks, and for food you might prepare golden snitch cupcakes or Bertie Botts strange flavored jellybeans. You might make:Homemade butterbeer Treacle tart Cauldron cakes Pumpkin juice  , If you don't have any of the Harry Potter movies, or if you are missing some of them, you'll have to purchase or rent the missing DVDs. Check for scratches ahead of time and give each movie a test run before the day of your party. It would be disappointing if you made it most of the way through your marathon and then had to stop due to a damaged disk or corrupted digital file.   If you're missing one of the Harry Potter movies in your collection, you might ask one of your friends to bring the movie to the party. That way you can focus on getting ready!  , When your marathon day finally arrives, put the first movie on your TV and allow it to play for a few minutes to check the volume. After you've adjusted the volume to a good level, pause the movie at the beginning so all you have to do is push "play.", Disposable cups, paper plates, and a few rolls of paper towel can make clean up easier when your marathon's through.You can even buy cups and plates decorated with Harry Potter designs. These should be available at your local grocery or dollar store, though if you have difficulty finding Potterverse themed products, an online retailer might be your best bet.  Depending on the recipes you've found, or depending on your favorite Potterverse treats, you may need to buy additional supplies from your local grocery store. Once your treats are made, arrange your snacks in a way that mimics the movie, like arranging food on a long table like.   Organize your treats on a rolling cart and pretend during food breaks that you're riding the Hogwarts Express! Have backup treats ready so that when you've finished one you don't have to interrupt viewing.  You don't need to go over the top, but small details will certainly add to the atmosphere. If you plan on playing muggle quidditch you'll need brooms for players, and these could be stacked off to the side as decorations in the meantime. Posters from the movies can be taped to walls, butterbeer served in an intricate looking carafe or coffee press, and the books can be placed around the viewing area to give your home some Potter flair., These can be something that you send your guests on their way with once the party is done, or maybe you'll want to give these to your friends when they arrive as a way of saying thanks for coming. To make your goody-bags more authentic, you might include:   Chocolate coins wrapped in gold foil Mini creatures, like spiders, frogs, and dragons A "potion" that's really a juice box  , You'll want your space to be as comfortable and as easy to move around in as possible. Move furniture that is blocks walkways or takes up unnecessary space, and bring extra seating from other rooms if you are able.If you are worried you won't have enough seating, you might make a cozy nest with blankets and pillows in front of your TV.  Even if you don't have a CD of the soundtrack from one of the Harry Potter movies, you can still stream tracks from YouTube, Pandora, or other online media providers. This will get your guests into the mood to marathon watch Harry Potter from start to finish., This may be as simple as having your guests choose a strip of paper with one of the four Hogwarts houses written on it from a "Sorting Hat." Or you might do something more elaborate, like have each guest that's arrived duel the next guest to arrive.If dueling, you might want to write up a cheat sheet for duelists that has offensive and defensive spells listed.  After you've sorted your guests according to house, you can award points to each house for good things done and trivia known. Use a spare piece of parchment style paper leftover from your invitations, if you have any, and keep track of house points to make things fun. You might award points for:   Quoting lines with the movie Knowing obscure movie facts Pointing out errors and mistakes  , Unplanned breaks might happen over the course of your marathon, but each of those will add time to your already 20 hour long journey through the Potterverse. Be sure food is conveniently placed so that your guests can eat as they get hungry.   Stopping to prepare food can put you behind in your viewing schedule. Have pre-made food ready to go in your refrigerator, or plan in advance to order in once the snacks are gone.  Stand up and really stretch yourself out every hour or so to prevent yourself from becoming uncomfortable. Sitting for extended periods of time is bad for your health, but taking five to moving around and stretch out every 30 minutes to an hour can relieve many of these problems., As you and your guests graze on the goodies you've set out, you'll have to clear off empty dishes and bring out more food as necessary. Use your scheduled break times to top off your Bertie Botts jellybeans or replenish your cauldron cakes.	Determine your guest list. Plan a date. Figure out your marathon goals. Choose break-time activities. Make and send invitations. Contemplate snacks with a Harry Potter theme. Buy or rent the movies. Ready the first movie and balance volume. Stock yourself with supplies, like paper products. Make and arrange your snacks. Add Potter themed decorations. Make Potter themed goody-bags. Clear your viewing space. Play music from the Potterverse. Enjoy a pre-viewing activity to prepare for the marathon. Give out house points, if applicable. Stick to your schedule. Take plenty of breaks. Replenish the food regularly.
You want to have two times the amount of wax flakes than your jars' ounces.For example, an 8 oz jar will need 16 oz. of wax flakes. Use a heat-resistant glass measuring cup with a handle, such as a Pyrex cup, to measure and then later melt the flakes.   When choosing wax flakes, soy based wax burns longer than paraffin and some people prefer it as a natural ingredient. Make sure that you buy wicks that are meant for soy candles if you choose to use soy instead of paraffin wax.  All you will need is a medium sized pot or saucepan and a stovetop range. Place the measuring cup on the side of the pot and fill the pot with water. You want a lower level of water so that the water doesn't splash into the wax as it boils.  You don't want a full rolling boil because that may cause the wax to overheat. Stir the wax with a wooden spoon as it melts so that all of the flakes are equally liquefied., You want to keep the temperature of the wax between 150°-180° F or 65°-80° C. Do not leave the wax unattended. This is so that it doesn't overheat but is mostly for safety. At these temperatures wax can burn skin easily.  Break off small pieces of non-toxic wax crayon pieces to add a hue to the wax. A little bit goes a long way, so add the crayon in increments of a 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) piece at a time.You can test out the color intensity as you go by dropping a little wax onto some parchment paper and letting it cool as the wax finishes melting.  Once it reaches these temperatures and is fully melted, set the measuring cup aside. Let the wax cool down to 125° F or 50° C. You cannot add the essential oils or scents at a higher temperature because the scent can evaporate away. , For every 16 oz. of wax flakes, use ten drops of essential oils.You can mix and match scents and oils for a unique candle. For scent ideas, reference your own favorite candle scents or smell different oil combinations to determine what meshes and what clashes.	Measure out your wax flakes. Make a double boiler to melt the wax. Turn the stove to a low to medium heat. Test the temperature of the wax. Add color to your candle. Take the wax off the stove. Add the essential oils.
If the root structure of your grass or other vegetation is so thick that it’s preventing the soil from absorbing the water, use a lawn aerator to break through the barrier. Punch holes through the ground with the aerator’s spikes or tines so the water can reach deeper sooner. Choose from a variety of models (from aerators you can wear under your shoes while walking to others that you push like a lawn mower) based on the size of your affected area.All models are generally divided into two classifications: spike and core aerators. Core aerators are widely considered the most effective. Aerating your lawn will also attract more worm activity. Worms will create even more pathways for water to travel into and through the soil.  If a soil test reveals that your lawn is primarily clay, add new elements that will promote water absorption. Use a till or landscaping rake to loosen and remove at least 6 inches (15 cm) of topsoil from the affected area. After removing that, rake the bed of your hole again to loosen the underlying soil so it mixes well with the 6-inch (15-cm) layer of organic materials that you’re about to add. Then rake in a mix of compost, dead leaves, wood chips, tree bark, and horticultural sand.The new organic material will be lighter and more permeable than clay. It will also promote plant life, which in turn will absorb more water through its roots. Worms will also be drawn to the richer soil, and the holes they create will increase drainage. Gypsum and limestone are also effective at breaking up clay for more permeability.  Plant landscaping trees, shrubs, or plants that are particularly thirsty in or near the affected area. Note how much sun or shade it receives where your drainage problems occur. Choose local vegetation that will thrive in your specific yard. If your soil is mostly clay, be sure to choose plants well adapted to that soil.Ideal plants for clay: (trees) birch, blue spruce, crabapple, douglas fir, eastern hemlock, eucalyptus, Japanese maple, juneberry, Norway spruce, western red cedar; (shrubs) barberry, butterfly bush, hydrangea, rose, viburnum; (plants) bigleaf periwinkle, common juniper, creeping juniper, creeping raspberry, elephant’s ears, geranium., If your soil isn’t clay, but you still experience poor drainage, go a step further and turn the affected area into a rain garden. Dig a hole in the center of that area. Make it deep and wide enough for all of the surrounding runoff or standing water to collect in. Create a planting mix that is 60% sand, 20% compost, and 20% topsoil to fill the hole. Select plants that are native to your area and thrive in water to plant in your new garden.Keep your rain garden at least 10 feet (3 m) from the house and at least 50 feet (15.2 m) from a septic system. In the U.S., call 811 to make sure underground utilities aren't in the way.Ideally, all the water in your rain garden should be absorbed within a day of rainfall. This is partly why creating a rain garden in clay soil isn’t a solution, since water has a tougher time draining through clay. A rain garden is a great endpoint for gutter drains and dry creek beds to get rid of runoff from roofs, driveways, and patios.	Aerate your lawn. Alter the soil’s composition. Use vegetation to absorb water. Create a rain garden.
Warming up is going to take about twenty minutes.If you don't stretch you could pull a muscle. Warming up for dance class is one of the most important parts of the process.   OPTIONAL: Put on some classical ballet music to do the warm-up.; , In first positions, which is where your legs are together and they are turned out, have your hand on the barre, and do a demi-plié, and then go back up. Then another demi, and then a full grande plié, going all the way down, and back up.  Your arm either to the side or above you, go slowly down to floor, bending your back.  Make sure as you come up, your arm and head are aligned. ,, First do coupé, then possé, the put your leg on the barre, and just bend your back and stretch your leg. Remember to point your foot on the barre. Plié your leg that is on the ground. Stay for 16 counts or seconds(same thing).   Rond de jambes, which is your toe on the floor, moving either on the outside of your body or the inside. Do some slow rond de jambes, then quick ones. As you end your rond de jambe, feel free to put a few battements here and there.  16 in first position, 16 on the right leg with your left leg behind it in coupé, the same except on your left.  As you grow into it, feel free to add more to your warm-up and stretches.	Warm up every muscle in your legs. Start off with going through all five positions. Do this after a Port de bras, which means "carriage of the arms". Try to go as far as you can, and make sure your head faces your belly-button. Put your arm to the side, part your feet to second position, and repeat.  , Repeat these for all positions, except when you come up from the port de bras on fifth position, go on relevé, which is on the ball of your foot, what people call, "on your tippy toes".  , Now move on to stretching your leg. Finish with plié relevés!, These are the basics of warming up.
Unless you are painting a mural, you might want to limit your colors to two or three; this includes the base/background color of the wall. If you make your wall too busy, it will draw attention away from the rest of your room. Here are some color ideas to get you started:   If you want a more subtle look, use two different shades for your wall and design. For example, you can paint your wall a dark blue, and stencil on some bird silhouettes in light blue. If you want a bolder look, use contrasting colors. For example, you can paint your wall a fresh, spring green, and some leaf and branch outlines in bright white. You can also paint colored designs. For example you could start with a dark brown or black branch on a white wall. Then, you could add some light pink cherry blossom flowers to the branch.  Most walls with designs have a specific theme to them. The easiest designs to paint are silhouettes or outlines. They will be just enough to add some interest and movement to your wall, but they won't be so busy as to detract attention from the rest of your room. Here are some common themes:   Nature-related, such as branches, leaves, and birds Abstract designs, such as scrolls and damask  , Do you want your design to cover the entire wall, or just a small patch? How you arrange the design is important. Here are some ideas to get you started:   If you are covering your entire wall with the design, consider a grid or checked pattern. If you are covering just a small patch, consider making the patch more asymmetric than asymmetric. If you are using both large and small shapes in your design, try to place the larger designs more towards the center of the patch, and the smaller designs towards the edges.  Most acrylic paints will have a glossy, satin/semi-gloss, or matte finish. Most walls will have a satin/semi-gloss or matte finish. If you use the same finish for both your wall and your design, you will get a more uniform result. The design will blend into the wall, and look like it is part of it. If you use contrasting finishes (such as a glossy design on a matte wall), you will get a bolder result. The design will contrast with the background/wall, which can create a very interesting result.  Some designs are better suited to certain rooms than other designs. For example, you might consider a more energized design in a room that sees a lot of activity, such as a family room. Bedrooms are generally a place of rest, so a more peaceful design might do better there. Here are some ideas to get you started:   For a fancy dining or family room, consider using dark, rich colors. Use ornate designs, such as scrolls and damask. For a kitchen, consider using something bright and open. You can also paint some food-related designs, such as grapevines or citrus. For a bedroom, use colors that you find peaceful. These can be cool blues and purples, refreshing greens, or even pastels. Consider using something organic for the design, such as long, sweeping curves, leaves, flowers, or branches.	Choose your color scheme. Pick a theme. Decide on the layout. Consider the paint finish. Consider the room that you are painting.
Distance can create a lot of insecurity in a relationship. If you have preexisting issues with insecurity or trust, distance can intensify these feelings. Try to find ways to work on your own insecurities.Talk about your insecurities with your partner and others. While you should not be accusatory when talking to your partner, it's okay to say you're feeling insecure. A little reassurance can go a long way. Examine your own issues with trust and insecurity. They may stem from a previous relationship. Try to understand that, while it's normal to worry when a partner is away, a lot of insecurity may be baseless.  When you and your partner are reunited, you will both be slightly different. There is a large chunk of time the two of you did not share, and you both may have become more self reliant during this time. Try to accept that, when your partner returns, your relationship may be different than it was before. This is not necessarily a bad thing. While you have both changed, this may be for the better. The two of you may feel more secure in the relationship after seeing it thrive from a distance., Communication will sometimes be difficult. Try to be understanding of this fact. There may be times when you don't hear from your partner for a few weeks. During these times, have others you can come to for support and care., Long distance can put a large amount of stress on a relationship. It's normal to feel insecure, but if you feel like the stress is becoming too much, seek out a therapist. A qualified therapist can help you work out your insecurities and find better ways to cope with distance. You can find a therapist by asking your regular doctor for a referral or seeing what's covered under your insurance. If you are in school, you may be entitled to free counseling through your university.	Work out issues on your end. Accept personal growth will occur while you're apart. Have realistic expectations about communication. Seek professional help, if necessary.
You will probably need to remove a small panel, called an access panel, at the bottom of the tank in order to see whether the pilot light is actually out. If you do not see a small flame burning, then your pilot light has gone out.          If you have a newer water heater, it is possible that your panel is not removable and that you view your pilot light through glass. In this case, if you cannot see a flame burning through the glass, then your pilot light is out.; , You should never try to reignite your pilot if there is gas leaking from your water heater, as this is extremely dangerous to both you and your home. Before attempting to relight the pilot, do a simple smell test to check for leakage.Stand next to your water heater and see if you detect any unusual smells. Then kneel down and sniff near any valves on the front and side of the tank. Natural gas is odorless by nature, but gas companies add a substance called mercaptan to it to make it detectable to humans. Leaking gas smells like sulfur or rotten eggs.If you smell gas in either of these places (even a faint smell), do not attempt to relight the pilot. Leave the area of the water heater and call your gas company immediately; they will tell you how to proceed. Also listen for a hissing sound near the water heater, as this is a sign of a gas leak., Specific instruction of details for your individual model may be listed here, and they may help guide you in the process of relighting the pilot for your specific water heater.  This is typically located on the front of a box found on the outside of the water heater.  This valve is usually located on the same box as the temperature control, only it’s likely on top of the box; it regulates gas flow to the pilot burner beneath the hot water tank., After turning the knob off, wait 10 minutes before proceeding to allow any residual gas from the tank to clear from the air. Safety is key!        , There are two basic styles of gas hot water heaters, “new” and “old.” Old style heaters will require you to use your own flame to relight the pilot, while new style tanks come equipped with a pilot light igniter.         The exact look of the buttons on new style tanks may vary, but many have a red igniter button set a few inches away from the temperature and regulator valves.  If you have an old style water heater, you will need to find a long reach “wand” lighter or fireplace matches to relight the pilot.          Do not attempt to relight a pilot with a regular matchstick or a small cigarette lighter, as this will require placing your fingers in a small, tight space too close to the open flame and put you in danger of getting burned.  The pilot is located at the end of the small silver tube that comes out the control valve. You may need to use a flashlight to see this area clearly.  Doing this starts the flow of gas into the tube that supplies the pilot light.          If your water heater’s gas valve does not push down, look for a red control button near the valve. Hold this button down.  While holding down the pilot gas valve or the red button with one hand, you will use your other hand to quickly light the pilot.          If you have a new style water tank with a built-in ignition switch, press this button. You should hear a clicking noise until the pilot burner lights.If you have an old style heater, apply your wand lighter/match to the pilot burner. Because you will be using one hand to depress the valve/red button and one hand to light the pilot, you may need someone to hold a flashlight for you if extra light is needed. Try to ask someone for help in advance so that you don’t get halfway through the process, then have to stop because you are unable to see what you’re doing.  This will heat the thermocouple, which is a sensor that shuts the gas off when the pilot is out.  After a minute, release the valve and control button to see whether the pilot light remains lit.  If the pilot light has remained lit, put the access panel back into place (if you had to remove it initially) so that no flame can escape into your home.  Turn the main gas valve back “On” and adjust the temperature control to your desired setting. The main burner under the tank should light and begin heating the water in the tank.  Be sure not to make it too hot, as you could inadvertently scald your hands or body while washing or bathing. 49 C (120 F) is the temperature recommended by the Consumer Product Safety Commission.	Check the pilot light. Make sure there is no leaking gas. Check inside the door panel of your water heater for instructions. Set the temperature control setting to the lowest temperature. Locate the regulator valve. Turn the knob to the “Off” position. Determine what style of water heater you have. Collect any necessary lighting materials. Find the pilot. Turn the gas valve to the "Pilot" setting and push down on it. Light the pilot burner. Continue holding down the gas valve or control button for 1 minute after the pilot light has been lit. Release the valve knob/control button. Replace the access panels. Reignite the main burner. Set the thermostat to your desired temperature.
Visualize it in your mind and if you can, rotate it in your brain, to better understand what you'll be drawing.; , to relate to. This will aid in the shading process, and even help you sketch look better if you understand the basic shape of what you are about to draw.  If you are uncomfortable, your drawing will look worse than what it should, so get a nice chair, fix the lighting and put on some favorite music.  If your hands are all sticky, wet or cold, your hand will not perform as well as it should.  There's no set way.  If it is something large, such as a car or tree, then get a clip board, sit down by it, and start sketching. , If you make a mistake, then you can easily erase the light lines.  Do not do a blind contour (staring at your subject while trying to draw), although this is good for practice drawing, it can deform your drawing terribly.  If you think you sketched lines too close or too far apart, erase them. Too many sketch lines on a drawing makes it look like your drawing is twisting. Going over the same line many times can make it dark and hard to erase if you decide it's wrong.  To add value, on the darker, shaded parts of the object you're drawing, shade them on your sketch. Go from a very dark, and lighten it gradually to a very light shade.  It'll make your drawing look better, and add some theme to it.  Traditionally, after a sketch, artists lightly add their signature (Yes, in cursive) to the bottom right corner of their drawing. You can also add something like '13 to it, too if you'd like.	To start off, think of your planned sketch. Look for shapes such as circles, squares, triangles, etc. Position yourself comfortably. Good hands: How does that help?, Position your paper: This goes along with being comfortable, so put your paper at an angle that you feel comfortable with. If your item is small, place it in front of you where you can effectively sketch it. Begin Drawing.  , Start from one side of the object, quickly and lightly take your pencil back and forth on the paper to make soft, light strokes. Be sure to constantly look up at your subject and compare the two. Don't be afraid to use the eraser. Apply Finishing touches: When you're done, take your eraser and remove the sketchy lines if you wish. Add more interest, add a poorly sketched (but still alright looking) background. Add Your signature!
Your local hardware store will have a variety of tube benders available at different price points. The major differences may include the amount of hydraulic force the bender can apply to the tube as well as the size and durability of the accompanying die set.   The dies are curved pieces you attach to the bender and into which you place the tubing to form the bend. The different dies will correspond to different diameters of tubing. Additionally, you can find die sets for either round or square tubing. Ensure that you buy a tube bender and not a pipe bender. Tube and pipe are not synonymous, and the scaling is even different, so the dies in a pipe bending set will not properly fit tube. This usually leads to flattening, buckling, or kinks in tube bent with a pipe bender.; , As always, specific machinery may have specific steps due to design or other requirements. Thoroughly consult the directions that come with your equipment.  For instance, if you need to bend 1” tubing, then you would select the 1” die.Using the correct die is very important. If the tubing doesn’t fit snugly into the die, then you can end up with a flattened or kinked finished product.  Once you attach the die, you will feed the tube into the bender so that the spot where you want to bend is in the center of the die. You will then tighten down the bender, which will have a pneumatic jack, enough to keep the tubing in place.  You cannot set the bender to a specific degree angle for you and let it do the rest, so this means measuring the exact angle to which you need your tube bent.The easiest solution is to use a digital angle gauge, which you can attach to the level tube before you begin bending. As you incrementally bend the tube, the angle gauge will track the measurement of the angle.  As you increase the force in the bender, the tube will bend to sharper angles. Once your angle gauge has measured the angle you want, you can release the pressure on the tube and remove it from the machine., Since using too much force can still lead to kinks in a bent tube, practice on scrap tubing before placing a more expensive piece into the bender.   Packing the tube with sand before placing it in the bender can also help it bend evenly without buckling or kinking.	Purchase a tube bender. Follow the instructions. Select the appropriate-size die for the tubing you need to bend. Place the tubing into the bender. Measure the correct angle. Bend the tube to your desired angle. Practice with scrap tubing.
Leave tabs on each of the sides.   It will look like this:      ; ,,  Make the holes be about 1 inch (2.5cm) apart in the center of the tab in this manner:  , Each milk jug hot cap will have 4 loop stakes, one for each tab. You can buy several packages of loop stakes at a hardware store like Lowe's or a garden store for a package of 10. You can also make your own loop stakes from used hanger wire. You will need a lot of hangers; ask your local charity store or dry cleaner for spares.  Put a little dirt over each tab to help hold them in place. Save the lids to the milk jugs and put them on the "hot caps" at night if it is going to be especially cold, but always take them off in the day so that air movement will help prevent sunburn as well as mold growth.  You can clean them and store them away for next year or make new ones as needed.	Cut the bottoms off the jugs. Bend the tabs out.  , Use a paper punch to punch two holes in each tab. You can push loop stakes in the holes to hold the milk jug hot caps down over plants. When you transplant the plants to the garden you can now cover each small plant with one milk jug hot cap secured by 4 loop stakes. When the weather begins to get warm and danger of hard frost is past, remove the jugs.
Go en pointe in fifth position, keeping both hands on the barre but not leaning onto it.; , However, you're going to have to look very weird while doing so. Plie your legs, but not your feet. Keep your feet in the same position while bending your legs.  Switch your feet like you do during a changement (jump from fifth to other fifth, or switching feet in jump). Land in the same position as you started, while en pointe and your legs in plie.    Once you get really good at it, turn around so that you are facing away from the barre and try this time. Now, you can't lean on anything, so it makes it harder. Once you get good at that, try going into center. It is even more important that you are supervised during this step. Go slowly.	Start at the barre. Plie en pointe. Jump. Straighten your legs, and do it again.
If you're hiring workers to help, you need to know how much you'll pay them. If you're painting for someone else, you need to know how much is fair to charge them. One to two painters can usually paint 2,500 square feet in one to two days. It usually costs around $800 a day.For a small room, such as the 650 square foot example, it should only take a few hours. Divide 650 by 2,500 to get roughly .25. This means you will probably only pay a quarter of the cost of a full day's worth of work, meaning the paint job will be roughly $200.  If there is a lot of furniture to move or if you're painting with different colors, this will tack on extra time. If you believe the job will require extra labor, tack on some extra money. For example, if you're painting your 650 square foot room two different colors, add $100 on to the labor costs. This brings labor costs to $300., Unfortunately, paint jobs do not always go as planned. Parts of a home may become damaged, paint may spill, and so on. It's a good idea to give yourself a little wiggle room. You can give consumers an estimate roughly $50 to $100 higher in case of an accident., After you have all the individual costs calculated, add them together to get a rough estimate. In the 650 square foot example, the estimate would come to around $535. In case of accidents, you can quote about $635., If you're hiring painters, it's not always a good idea to try to calculate costs yourself. Get a quote from several different companies, explaining your needs and the size of your home. This will give you a more accurate price and help you budget for a paint job.	Factor in the basic cost of labor. Think about anything that could lengthen painting time. Account for potential accidents. Calculate the total cost. Ask for a professional estimate.
If you're extremely sensitive to peppers, a seedless jalapeno might be strong enough to cause your eyes to start watering. If you're a fire eater, you'll need a hot one.   Use gloves when you handle hot peppers. It's well known that touching a hot pepper and then touching your eye will cause irritation and tearing. This means you could skip the next step and simply touch the inside of a pepper and put your finger in your eye, but the pain probably isn't worth it. If you don't have fresh peppers on hand, habanero or another hot sauce might do the trick. Chopping a white onion is another good substitute for hot peppers. Just make sure it's white, since this type of onion emits the chemicals that cause people to cry.  Remember that a little goes a long way, especially when it comes to habaneros. Eat just a little chunk of the pepper, letting it roll over your tongue and against the roof of your mouth before swallowing. If you don't feel your face turning hot, eat some more.   As always, furrow your brow and frown to make your fake crying act seem believable. In this case you should keep your mouth closed so the person for whom you're performing doesn't see the pepper chunks inside. Try not to make your chewing motions obvious. If necessary, you may need to chew the pepper before you face the person watching you "cry."  , If your face stops producing sweat and tears before you're ready for the scene to end, find a way to eat another chunk of pepper. You might cover your mouth with a handkerchief while you bring the piece to your mouth, or excuse yourself to go to the bathroom and eat it there before returning with fresh tears.	Get a fresh habanero or jalapeno pepper. Eat the pepper right before you're ready to cry. Discreetly eat more pepper to continue the act.
Talk to your family about the appropriate actions to take in order to stay safe during a landslide, especially if you live in a vulnerable area. Be sure to discuss evacuation procedures, as well as safe locations and areas to avoid., Make sure everyone knows how to get emergency alerts from local officials, whether it be via phone, television, or radio. Talk to your local emergency management agency to see how alerts are delivered in your area.Don’t forget to emphasize the importance of listening to the local news station for emergency updates in the event of a landslide!  , Write down each family member’s phone number, email, social media, medical facilities, and school or workplace. Having this information on hand will make it easier for family members to get in touch in the event of landslide or other emergency., In the event of a landslide or other emergency, choose a place where the family will meet to reunite. Select a location in your neighborhood and your town. Make sure everyone is aware of the location.Choose a location that is accessible for everyone in your family, particularly for members with disabilities. If you have pets, pick a pet-friendly area. You might choose to meet at a neighbor’s house or your mailbox for your neighborhood location, and at a community center or a place of worship for your town location.  Compile contact information, landslide safety protocol, and your emergency meeting places on a single document. This is your emergency plan. Give every family member a copy and make sure they carry it with them at all times.Put a copy somewhere central in your home, like on the fridge. You may also want to make an emergency plan for your business.  Meet with your household periodically to review your plan and practice landslide safety protocol. This is important if you live in an area where landslides are common.	Discuss safety protocol in the event of a landslide. Understand how to get emergency alerts. Collect family members’ contact information. Pick an emergency meeting place. Compile and share your plan. Practice your plan.
Check with well-known ticket resellers.The prices will be higher than face value, but not as expensive as VIP packages.For example, try checking the websites of resellers like TicketsNow,TicketLiquidator, and TicketNetwork.   A concert ticket search engine – for example, SeatGeek – allows you to search through multiple ticket sellers at once.  Auction sites like eBay can have a great deal of tickets offered for sale. Ticket prices will generally be higher than face value, because the holder of tickets may sell at any price they wish. Also, the show is sold out, so most if not all of the tickets will be sold in auction format, where the price is determined by the highest bidder.   Reviewing the seller’s feedback first is a good way to gauge their trustworthiness. You should also familiarize yourself with the auction site’s terms and conditions about refunds, in case you don’t receive the ticket on time or it does not grant you access as it should., Search online classifieds in your local area, such as Craigslist. You can also look in the “For Sale” section of classifieds in your local newspaper. Individual or season ticket holders may be offering their tickets for sale.  Try contacting the box office a few hours before the event. If they tell you the show is sold out, you can try again an hour before show time. Season ticket holders do sell seats back at the last minute., If all else fails and you aren’t able to get tickets to an event in your area, check the artist’s tour schedule for stops in other cities. There may be a nearby city on the agenda next that isn’t sold out. Alternately, you may want to make travel arrangements to see the performer in an even further locale if it is easier to acquire tickets for it and you don’t mind getting away for a couple of days.  People who resell tickets on the street outside venues are referred to as ticket “scalpers.” As a last resort, you could try to buy tickets that way, if it’s allowed in your area. Check with the laws of your state first. Some states allow this practice, but in other states it is illegal.Even if buying tickets from a scalper is legal in your area, it is still a risky practice. Counterfeit tickets can appear very real, and there is no definite way of verifying them until you present them at the gate of the venue.	Try ticket brokers. Check auction sites. Check local classifieds. Call the box office. Check other cities. Find out if you’re permitted to buy from a scalper.
; , Even if it is not a car stereo or deck, a simple MP3 player or an iPod with portable speakers can do the trick.  Avoid salty snacks. Fruits are always preferable. They not only give you energy but are also tasty in-between-meal snacks.  Even small things such as a rag cloth or a first aid kit can make a difference.  You must not be in a hurried state of mind. That will only tire you quickly and make it even more difficult for you to sustain yourself throughout the long drive.  On long drives, the last thing you would want would be to subject your ears to rock or metal music in short bursts. This will only increase the fatigue factor and induce boredom at critical moments. soulful rock or instrumentals are the best.  have light meals but eat at regular intervals. You would not want to drive on an empty stomach. That would be disaster as driving is energy sapping. Lots of fluids throughout the journey is the best way to tackle the situation.  Though this is contrary to the popular maxim, do not try out new and dangerous roads even if you have the vehicle to do it. Inclement weather coupled with rocky roads is a deadly combination.  This will only stress you out. Take each mile as it comes. Some might take a while whereas some might get over before even you know it!  , Fresh air can wake you up and keep you alert.  When you are driving on a plain unoccupied road, it is very easy to go too fast.  Long drives are one of the best ways to relax and be with yourself! You will actually get to know yourself better!	Get into the car knowing your own presence, respecting yourself and feeling good about the whole drive. Ensure you have a good music system in place. Have a good stock of water, juices and snacks to munch on. Ensure you have your car checked up for oil, water and other essentials. Drive at an easy pace - not too fast, not too slow. Drive to the pace of soothing music. Do not eat too much. Take the road that is MOST traveled. Do not constantly time yourself. Even if it is hot/cold outside, open a window every once in a while. While some might argue this point, use cruise control on open roads to avoid speeding tickets. Enjoy your drive!
An empty room is ideal for creating a craft space, but even a corner of a room will work. You can make a craft space out of a garage, shed, or large, walk-in closet as well. Look for a space that has access to natural light. It is also best if the space is quiet and not close to inside or outside traffic.Consider how much room you will need for your supplies and to carry out your craft making. Choose a space where you will have easy access to electrical sockets.; , Clear out the space until it is empty if there is already furniture or items there. Once it is empty, clean it thoroughly. Sweep, mop, dust, and remove any stains that may be present. You will want a fresh start to create your craft space., For a smaller space, you will not need to prepare it as much because it will probably already be painted and prepared. You may want to paint a larger space before adding furniture and supplies. Also consider the flooring. Think about carpeting, rugs, or tiling.You can buy paint for the walls at home improvement stores like Home Depot and Lowes. An easy fix for a floor is a large rug that will cover a large amount in the room.  Consider the size of the space before purchasing or obtaining furniture. A small space will probably not be able to fit a lot of furniture. Your space should at least be able to fit a desk and chair. For a larger space, you will need a desk, comfortable chair, and table, along with organizational furniture.The desk should be large enough to work at comfortably.  You will at least need to have a table lamp in your craft space. A table lamp is good for small-scale projects that require extra lighting. Look for an adjustable lamp that can be moved to be closer or farther away from the object you’re working on. For a larger space, consider at least two lamps to place around the room.You can purchase lamps at furniture and home improvement stores, like Ashley Furniture and Ethan Allen.  You will need shelves and/or cabinets to store your crafting supplies. The amount of shelves and cabinets you put in the room depends on the amount of space you have. Choose a shelf or drawer depending on the type of supplies you will be using. Drawers are better if you need more depth, but shelves provide easier access to grab an item when you need it.Organize each shelf or drawer by item type. For example, put all sewing supplies in one drawer. In another drawer, put all of your ribbons and bows.  Put a rack above the desk to hang items on for easy access. This will save space and will make certain items faster to find. You can hang a rack with hooks, or a rack that acts as a shelf. Racks are typically wooden or made of metal. They can be purchased at most home improvement stores.You can hang items like scissors and spools of thread on a rack.  Use items like jars, small boxes, and dishes to hold small crafting supplies. Glass jars are best for pencils and pens. They can be kept on the desk. Small boxes are good for holding things like beads and pins. Use small plates to display small baubles and decorative items.Keep one type of item in each storage container. For example, keep all pens in a separate jar from all pencils.  Hang a board somewhere in the room, like above the desk, to attach ideas and other items to. This can act as a “vision” board, or simply as a place to put reminders. A corkboard works best, but you can also use a board covered in fabric. Use thumbtacks or pins to attach sheets of paper or pictures to the board.A vision board is great for keeping papers, pictures, and fabric samples to aid with current and previous projects.  Buy or create labels to label your organizational items. Labeling will make finding, returning, and keeping your crafting supplies organized easier. You can create the labels by using a label maker, or writing the labels out with a pen or marker.You can also create labels by attaching tape to small strips of paper.  You will probably use paper at some point during your crafting. Some types of paper that are good to have in a craft room are scrap book paper, wrapping paper, white cardstock, and color paper. Paper can be bought at craft stores and stored in its own compartment in a drawer or shelf., Coloring and painting supplies are necessary for decorating crafts. Some coloring supplies to invest in are colored pencils, crayons, markers, and sharpies. Painting supplies to buy are acrylic, oil, or watercolor paint, chalkboard paint, glitter paint, and brushes. You should also have a palette and cup available for mixing and applying paint., Glue, tape, and other adhesives will come in handy at some point during crafting. Mod Podge, Fabric glue, Elmer’s Glue, Super Glue, and a hot glue gun with glue sticks are some types of glues that are good to keep in a crafting space. For tape, scotch tape, double sided tape, command strips, and painters tape are helpful to keep around.You do not have to invest in all of the types of glues and tapes listed above all at once. Consider what type of crafting you will do most before purchasing supplies.  It is helpful to have cutting supplies nearby during crafting. You should have at least one pair of regular sharp scissors, although it is good to have a few pairs available in different sizes. An X-acto knife and/or box cutter is needed for projects that require a more precise cut.You should also keep a cutting board near your scissors and razors to avoid cutting into the desk or floor.  If you will be sewing, keep your supplies together in a corner of the room. This includes a sewing machine, needles, thread, or any other items you may need to sew. Keep your sewing supplies in a box or drawer close to the sewing machine., Random supplies are sure to accumulate after multiple crafting experiences. Keep these items in a separate box marked “miscellaneous.” It is also helpful to purchase some miscellaneous supplies to keep around. Some items that may be useful are stamps, stencils, stickers, pieces of fabric, and a hole puncher.	Choose a space in your home. Clean the space. Prepare the space. Put in furniture. Add lighting. Put up shelves. Hang a rack. Add small storage items. Put up a board. Use labels. Buy various types of paper. Choose coloring and painting supplies. Get various types of glue. Obtain cutting tools. Set up a sewing area. Keep a box of miscellaneous supplies.
This is the first impression people will have of your house, so ensure that your home looks neat and welcoming. Add shrubs and plants and keep your grass well groomed.If you don't have enough of a front yard, or any yard at all, then add plant pots with plenty of flowering shrubs. Make sure that your front doorway, lighting, and any other features are all in good condition.; , In the summer months a landscaped yard is an extra space to spend time in. Groom your yard; add some native trees, if you have the room, and some flowering shrubs.You don't have to spend too much money. Just bring your yard up to the standards of the neighborhood and show off its potential.To get the most bang for your buck, try to make sure you grass is in good condition – with no obvious dry/dead patches. And add some shrubs or flowers in the front where they will be the most visible.  Even if you have a large yard, a deck is appealing and improves the value of a home. If you don't have a yard, then a deck offers a space to enjoy the outdoors.   Try to make sure that the deck addition matches the rest of the existing house for added value and aesthetic appeal., Cleaning the outside of your home will make it look much nicer and will add value to your home. One option for cleaning home exteriors is to use a pressure washer which sprays water at an incredibly high velocity and works well to clean exterior surfaces.   Another option for cleaning the outside of your home is to use a hand-pump garden sprayer filled with a mixture of water and oxygen bleach (not chlorine bleach). Simply spray it on, let it soak for ten minutes, and then rinse it off with water from the garden hose. Some people prefer this method over power washing because the high intensity water spray from the pressure washer can get in cracks where it doesn’t belong, can kill plants and other landscaping, and can erode wood and siding over time.To deep clean the interior of your home, make sure you focus on things like dusting the baseboards and ceiling fans, changing the air filters, scrubbing the grout in your showers, and cleaning out the fireplace if you have one.  Not only should your kitchen have new quality wooden cabinets, countertops and flooring, but it should be spacious and have lots of convenient storage space.Opt for a high-end stone counter if your budget allows, but make sure that the materials you use are comparable for the type of home you have. Many buyers want all stainless steel appliances, gas top stove, and a refrigerator with the ice and water functions in the door. These are the most important appliance updates to make if you are able to afford it. Include as many amenities as your space will allow, such as a breakfast bar and the latest appliances.  This is especially important for the "en suite," if you have one. Like kitchens, bathrooms are often a big selling point. Even the smallest upgrade can count for big points with potential buyers.Consider adding a whirlpool or spa tub in your master suite bathroom. Additionally, double sinks, separate multiple jet showers and a separate toilet room are all value adding features. Update your water pipes if necessary, but remember that this won’t add much value to your home since buyers expect that things like this will be in working condition., Adding new or updating the old light fixtures in your home can add a great deal of value. Most new homebuyers want houses that feel bright and sunny, so having adequate indoor lighting is valuable.Adding recessed lighting in the kitchen is especially helpful in increasing the value of your home.  Simply adding a fresh coat of paint can liven up any room. Make sure you carefully paint the edges and trim if you do the painting yourself. A poor paint job will probably look worse than the existing paint.Try to pick neutral colors that most potential buyers will find attractive so that you don’t have to paint over it if you ever decide to sell your house.  If you have hardwood flooring, take full advantage of it. Real hardwood flooring can increase your home’s value substantially, especially if you have it throughout your home.New carpeting or high quality laminate flooring are also options. Opt for natural colors and materials that go with everything. Finish the flooring (whether it is carpet, laminate, or hardwood) so that it is in prime condition and add throw rugs for a little color and warmth if it gets cold in the winter.  Open up some rooms so that you have more of an open plan space. Create a spacious feel to your home by knocking down a few walls. Discuss your options with an accredited contractor before making any drastic decisions.Make sure that you take into account which walls secure the foundation before making plans, and work around it. You can add an attractive pillar if it's secure enough and fits the character of your home.  If you have an unfinished basement, consider finishing it and creating an extra room. This will always add value to a home, so the investment will be worth it. You can even keep it simple by just finishing the walls and carpeting the floor.Adding livable floor space to your home will almost always add value to the home.  If you have an attic with useable space, you should maximize its potential and utilize the space whenever possible. Work around any existing ducts and machinery to maximize the area you can use for this project.This might include finishing an unfinished attic (adding sheetrock and flooring) so that it creates an entirely new room in your home. Or you may just want to add insulation and partial flooring to your existing attic space so that it adds a separate storage option in your home.	Improve your curb appeal. Landscape your yard. Add a deck. Deep clean the exterior of your home. Modernize your kitchen. Update your bathrooms. Update your interior lighting. Paint rooms selectively. Ensure that your flooring is up to date and in good condition. Create space. Finish your basement. Add insulation or finish the attic.
These are listed in the "Things You'll Need" section below.; , Any measuring device will work, as long as it's accurate. (Note: The picture shows a 5" wrist measurement.)  , The photos show the example of adding 8" (12.7cm) and then doubling (to 26"), but better to be safe than sorry. ,, If you did this correctly, it should appear symmetrical.  With this first knot, it's important that it's centered, so while you're pulling the ends apart, hold onto the very ends of the string.  It's quite alright if it goes over the knot, it's supposed to do that.  Add one dark bead on each string, and add one medium bead on each string.  This pattern should look similar to the tightly-bundled section of beads (see the figure in the previous step) that are closest to the clasp.  Now, put the two strings together, and thread one light bead through them. Continue in this fashion until you only have one more section to do before the bracelet fits you.   Along the way, make sure you check how much longer the bracelet needs to be every once in a while. If you overdo it, you're going to have to start all over again.  It's fine if it slides down over the beads in this last section. ,, Don't forget to mention to your friends that you made it all by yourself (with the help of wikiHow, of course)!	Gather the necessary items. Measure your wrist. Add 10 inches (25cm) to the wrist measurement, and then double the sum. Measure the beading string or thread.  , Cut the thread.  , String the beads and clasp onto the string in the following order: 1 medium, 1 dark, 1 end of clasp, 1 dark, and 1 medium. Tie a square knot with the string. Add one light bead, threading the bead through both strings together. Now, separate the two strings. Now, thread one light bead through both strings together. Add one dark bead on each individual string, and then one medium bead on each individual string. Add 1 dark bead on each strand, 1 medium on each strand, and then the other end of the clasp to either side. Tie a double-square knot.  , Snip of the ends of the string, but be careful not to cut off the knot!  , Enjoy wearing it.
At minimum, you should wear safety goggles and heat-resistant, fire-resistant gloves.   Also note that you will need to handle the stainless steel object with another device, like tongs or a vice. Everything you use should be both fire-resistant and heat-resistant to prevent accidental burns.; , You'll need to prepare enough coffee grounds to cover all sides of the stainless steel object you wish to antique.   If you've recently made a pot of coffee, you can use the spent grounds from that. Otherwise, pour enough warm to hot water over a fresh batch of grounds and give the grounds a few minutes to absorb the moisture For small, narrow objects like screws, you can fill a small cup with your prepared grounds. For larger objects, coat the bottom of a shallow tray with the grounds, instead.  Hold the metal object with tongs or a vice, then pass the flame of a lighter over the entire length of the object, heating it thoroughly.   Continue rotating and passing the flame over the stainless steel object until the metal begins to darken in color. For larger objects or a more controlled flame, consider using a propane tank with a lighter attachment instead of a handheld lighter. The stainless steel will reach temperatures just beneath 500 degrees Fahrenheit (260 degrees Celsius), so you need to work very carefully to prevent accidental burns.  As soon as the steel object darkens, quickly dip the heated portion into the prepared coffee grounds. Hold it in the grounds for 15 to 30 seconds.   The water in the coffee grounds should quickly cool off the metal. Theoretically, the steel should be safe to touch once you remove it from the grounds, but you should still proceed with caution. In addition to cooling off the metal, the coffee should dye the stainless steel, giving it the appearance of antiqued metal.  If you want to dye the steel even darker, reheat it and submerge it into the coffee grounds again.   You should be able repeat the process several times without damaging the metal. If you only want to dye one side or area darker, focus the heat on that area and only apply the coffee grounds to that spot.  When you're satisfied with the results, you can quickly polish the steel object by vigorously rubbing it with a soft cloth.   Wait until the object is cool enough to touch before polishing it. Polishing the piece should buff away coffee granules and some of the dark dye. It should also make the steel a little shinier. After you dye and polish the piece to your liking, the project is complete. The results should last indefinitely.	Wear the appropriate safety gear. Fill a container with warm, moist coffee grounds. Heat the steel using a lighter. Bury the steel in the coffee grounds. Repeat as needed. Polish as desired.
Sew the leather tag onto the rectangular cloth cutout using needle and thread.	Following the pattern guide, add the leather tag.
Snakegrass is a fairly resilient plant that can thrive in a few different environments. For optimal growing, you’ll want to make sure it gets plenty of sun, though it can also grow well in part shade. Make sure the spot you choose is at least mildly wet.  If you want to plant your snakegrass in water, make sure you choose a spot where the water is no higher than 4 inches (10 cm)., Snakegrass roots tend to ball up as they grow outwards, so make sure to choose a container that can accommodate this. As with any planting container, it should have drainage holes. However, growing snakegrass means you’ll need cover up the drainage holes enough that the roots, or rhizomes, can’t snake out of the drainage holes and spread to the rest of your garden. Lay fine mesh at the bottom of the container to protect the drainage holes.  Planting snakegrass in a container will help prevent it from spreading too wildly. If you want your snakegrass to spread, you’ll instead want to plant it directly in the soil. Be prepared for it to spread more efficiently than you might think., You can use any general purpose potting soil for this; snakegrass doesn’t need any specific nutrients or special soil. Add soil until you entirely cover the plant’s rhizomes. Leave a few inches between the top of the soil and the container’s rim.  If planting snakegrass in water, lay a layer of gravel an inch (2.5 cm) high on top of the soil. This will protect it, preventing it from getting flooded or washing out., The hole should be about 2-3 inches (5 - 7.6 cm) wider and an inch (2.5 cm) shallower than the container you used. Place the container in the hole, checking that it sticks out by about an inch. If it’s a bit too high, you can press down on the container and twist; this will help it dig deeper.  This is only needed if you want to partially bury the pot in the ground., Use the freshly dug soil to fill in the hole around your container. Make sure to pack the dirt tightly around the container. Water the soil around the container to help it settle.  Only do this if you’re looking to partially bury your container in the soil.	Choose the right area. Prepare a container. Place the plant in your container and add soil. Dig a hole and insert the container. Fill up the hole.
While chamomile can handle a little bit of shade, it prefers lots of sun. Set aside a spot in your garden that’s sure to enjoy plenty of light throughout the day., Remove any rocks, clumps of soil, or weeds by raking and hoeing the area. Go at least 1 foot (30.48 cm) deep. Then rake the soil back into place and pack it down for a nice, smooth planting surface., German chamomile is a bit hardier than other varieties. It can handle a bit of clay or low nutrition in the soil.German chamomile is technically an annual, which means it needs to be replanted each year. However, it self-seeds, so you don’t need to do the replanting! This means it actually acts like a perennial plant.  Roman chamomile does better in higher-quality soil. This variety is a perennial, meaning it doesn’t need to be replanted each year.If you want to raise the quality of the soil, mix a slow-release fertilizer with the soil before you sow seeds.  Be sure all threat of frost has passed before you put in the seeds. This timing will vary depending on where you live.In the United States and Europe, you should be safe to plant by mid-May or June. Warmer states in the southern half of the U.S. may be able to start earlier, depending on the weather. If you’re in the southern hemisphere planting in someplace like Sydney, Australia, the last frost should occur in early August., Sprinkle handfuls of seeds across the soil. Don’t worry about placement. You’ll make them into neat rows later.Use your hands to gently cover them with only a little bit of soil, as these seeds need light to germinate.You should still be able to see the seeds under their light covering of soil.  The seeds need a lot of water to germinate, so start this process off as soon as they’re planted. Use the mist or shower setting on your hose to moisten the soil. Keep the soil moist throughout the germination period, and when the seedlings are small. This will probably require a daily watering., Leave about 8 to 10 inches (20.32 to 25.40 cm) between each seedling, making neat rows of spaced plants. To thin the seedlings, cut the tiny plant off at ground level. Don't pull the seedling completely out of the ground, as you may disturb the roots of the remaining seedlings., If you want, buy mature chamomile plants at a garden center rather than starting the seeds either outside or indoors. Dig a hole double the size of the root ball and deep enough so the base of the leaves is right at soil level when the plant is put in the hole. Mix some slow-release fertilizer in with the soil, pack it down loosely, and water it until the soil is wet.While perennial plants can be put in any time of year, they do best when started in early autumn or late spring. Annuals should always be planted during these times. The ideal planting time varies depending on your location, but you should generally stick to a season when the weather is turning and getting either warmer or colder. Avoid planting in extreme heat or cold.	Pick a sunny, warm spot for your chamomile. Rake and even out the soil to prepare it. Plant German chamomile if you have poor soil. Plant Roman chamomile if you have well-drained, fertile soil. Sow your seeds in late spring or summer to avoid frost. Sprinkle the seeds on top of the soil. Water the seeds until the soil is moist. Thin seedlings when they're about 2 inches (5.08 cm) tall. Plant pre-grown chamomile in autumn or spring.
Now that you know some basic moves, you can start formulating a basic breakdancing routine. To start, learn how baby freeze can be used as a transition move. Transition moves are important in that they allow you to move from one breakdancing move to another.   The baby freeze, which you already know, is often used as a transition move. If you're moving between, say, a three-step and into a coffee grinder, you can do the baby freeze in between. This alerts viewers you've ended one move and will be trying a new one.When moving out of something like coffee grinder, you would return to the crouching position. You would then bend your right arm into a 90 degree angle and press it into your hip. Then, you could stretch out your other arm and elevate your legs. You are now in baby freeze. Hold for a few seconds.If you're engaging in top rocks, which we will go over next, you can simply drop to the floor and quickly get into the baby freeze position. Moving into baby freeze after top rocks can be a great transition between footwork and top rocks., Top rocks are hand moves that usually begin a breakdancing routine. Top rocks are simpler than footwork and serve as a signal to viewers you are about to start breakdancing. Learn some simple top rocks to begin your routine.   A basic beginning top rock involves standing with your feet hip-length apart. Move your arms and legs in sync. Step your left toe to your right side, waving your arms at the same pace. Then, return to the original position. Repeat with your right toe. After you feel comfortable with this move, speed it up and bounce slightly with your legs. Try to bounce to the rhythm of any music that's playing when breakdancing in public.You can also try a heel-to-toe step. To start, get in the same opening stance as the beginning. Kick your right foot out onto your heel and then flatten your foot and bend your knees slightly. Move your left foot out, resting your weight on your toe. Then, kick your left foot forward onto your left heel. Bend your knees slightly. Then, step out with your right foot and repeat the process. As with the first move, do this quicker and move to the beat., When you're beginning to breakdance, keep your routines simple. As you become more proficient in breakdancing, you can try longer routines with more complex moves.   To start, try the two different form of top rocks we went over earlier. Try to do them at a fast pace, moving in time with the music. Then, fall to the ground and move into baby freeze. Hold for a few seconds before engaging in footwork.For beginners, a recommended routine is two footwork patterns, baby freeze, and then some light freestyle moves. This means you simply go from one breakdancing move to the next, without transitioning in between.To put it all together, you could start off with the two top rocks moves. Then, fall into baby freeze for a few seconds. Transition into the three step, baby freeze in between, and then do a coffee grinder. Baby freeze again, and then freestyle some more footwork. You could, for example, do a handful of six steps.  Breakdancing is like any other art form. The more you expose yourself to breakdancing, the more you'll learn. Just as you'll have to read a lot to become a writer, watch a variety of breakdancing routines if you want to learn to breakdance.   You can watch breakdancing routines online. Many break-dancers have active YouTube and Instagram accounts. Breakdancing is common in the hip-hop community. If there are hip-hop clubs in your hometown, try going a few times a week. You may witness people breakdancing.	Use baby freeze as a transition. Start off with top rocks. Try a simple formula. Watch a variety of breakdancing routines.
You are essentially a salesman, and your product is the talent you manage. Salesmen do not sit and wait for people to come buy from them, so you shouldn’t either. Call casting agencies and directors and pitch your talent to them. Besides calling, you should create business cards, flyers, and postcards for your agency and your talent.   You want as many people as possible to know about you and your talent, so never think that you’ve made too many contact attempts. Make postcards with your talent’s photo and skill set listed, as well as your name and contact info. Send these postcards out to any casting agency or company that you think might be interested in hiring your talent. Call the places you sent postcards after a week or so and check in with them. Flyers could be placed around town promoting your agency and calling for new talent to contact you to see about a representation contract.  You may not book a gig on your first contact attempt, so continue to pursue it and don’t give up. Don’t sit and wait for clients to call you. Contact the same people consistently at intervals of a week or two. Eventually they are likely to offer you something. The most persistent agents are the ones that succeed.You have to constantly put your name and your talent out there if you want to secure gigs. Talent agents who put a few attempts out there and then rest won’t succeed. You will face rejection often as a talent agent, but you have to learn to shrug it off and move on to the next opportunity. Don’t let setbacks stall you.  As a talent agent, you will have to balance many conflicting schedules from clients and talent. Make use of an online calendar and input everything into your schedule. iCal and Google Calendar are good options. Keep track of contact information like phone numbers and names, as well.Make sure your talent is available for potential gigs and make sure they get to the gig on time. Missing opportunities makes you look bad. Start using a calendar immediately and learn to schedule your life. If you don’t always know what you’ll be doing, at least write it down after it happens so you get used to recording events. Keep a detailed contact list or catalogue with any clients that you meet or hear about so that you have what you need to contact them as soon as you have the chance.  Talent agents are middlemen between the talent and the clients who need to hire talent. Develop exceptional people skills and make the most of every interaction. Be friendly with potential clients and talent as well as anyone you already have a contract with. If you are easy to work with, more people will want to work with you.Go the extra mile to help someone out to show that you are a team player who wants everyone to succeed. Your success only comes from the success of your talent and your clients.  When you are lining up a job for your talent, you are responsible for working with the client to decide on payment. The client needs to make money to pay the talent so you can also earn money. Continually work to master the art of negotiating for the best possible contract for everyone involved.Clients want to get your talent for as little possible, so you may need to push them to offer you more money. Find a balance between pushing too far and not getting enough for your talent. You also have to work out an appropriate commission with your talent. You may decide on a standard rate or you may have a flexible rate depending on how much work each person gets. Make sure to get a contract between you, the client, and the talent in writing for every job or gig you set up. You always want proof of the agreement that is reached.	Market yourself and your talent. Be persistent in your marketing. Be highly organized. Connect with people. Negotiate contracts that benefit all parties.
Many vegetables do well in containers. Tomatoes, peppers, onions, beans, lettuce and squash are typical vegetables which can be container grown.  Climbing plants like cucumbers and pole beans need a trellis or fence upon which to grow.        Small fruited tomatoes such as cherry tomatoes do well in hanging baskets.      ; , Keep herbs pruned to keep them from over growing. Use them regularly to season your cooking.   Snapdragons, zinnias, petunias, geraniums, and marigolds are among the flowers that do well as potted plants. Cosmos, coreopsis and periwinkles are also good choices.       Be sure to place shade loving plants such as impatiens or begonias where they get only partial sun.       Plant taller flowers in the center of the pot and surround them with shorter plants. Cascading flowers are especially good to use in a container such as a hanging basket or window box.       An advantage to planting flowers in containers is that you can easily move them around to take advantage of sun and rain or to protect them from strong winds or hail. Placing a very large container on wheels will allow you to move it easily as well.  Water and fertilize as the requirements of your plant dictates.  Choose those that need only moderate watering and have longer blooming seasons.   Be sure your container will contain an expanding root system as a perennial plant can live and grow for years. Since your perennial plant can be overwintered and will grow for many seasons, planting perennials is practical and economical. Lavender, yarrow, coneflowers, astilbe, hostas, and lilies are some perennials you may consider growing. Plant a perennial shrub such a rose, hydrangea, or camellia in a container. Small fruit trees or citrus trees also do well as potted plants. Many perennials can be divided and thinned to make new plants which makes them an even more practical choice.  Coleus plants have a range of bright foliage from which to choose. Ivies and even cactus also are good candidates for your container garden.  Since plants in containers tend to dry out rapidly, use a water retaining potting mix or mulch. Placing plants in larger pots also helps keep them from drying out too easily.	Grow a vegetable garden in containers. Plant herbs such as parsley, rosemary, basil, mint, and dill in pots. Choose from among a myriad of annual flowers to use in containers. Use good potting soil and be sure to allow enough room in the container for the root system of the plant you are potting. Consider planting perennials in containers. Remember to use ornamental grasses and plants with interesting or colorful foliage as well. Maintain your container plant by regularly checking for pest infestation and disease.
The best size of dehumidifier to buy depends on how big the room is that you want to dehumidify. Measure the square footage of the main room where you’ll use the dehumidifier. Match that to the size of dehumidifier., In addition to being categorized in terms of room size, dehumidifiers are categorized according to the level of moisture in a given room. This is measured in number of pints of water that will be extracted from the environment in a 24-hour period. The result will be a room with your ideal level of humidity.   For example, a 500 square foot room that smells musty and feels damp would require a 40-45 pint dehumidifier. Consult a buying guide to determine the proper size for your needs.Dehumidifiers can accommodate up to 44 pints (20.8197 liters) per 24 hours in a space as large as 2,500 square feet (232.257 square meters).  Using a larger dehumidifier can potentially remove moisture from a room more quickly. Plus, you won’t need to empty the reservoir as often. However, larger machines do cost more to purchase and they use more electricity, adding to your overall costs., If you need a dehumidifier for a spa room, pool house, warehouse or other space, you should purchase a dehumidifier that is specially made for these spaces. Consult a home supply store to locate the correct type of dehumidifier for these locations.  If you plan to move the dehumidifier from room to room frequently, consider buying a portable model. These often have wheels on the base or are light and easy to move. Having a portable dehumidifier will also enable you to move it around the room.   If you need dehumidifying in multiple rooms in your house, you might consider ducting a dehumidifier into your HVAC system instead of buying a single room unit.  Modern dehumidifiers have multiple features and settings, and the more expensive the machine is, the more options it will have. Some of the potential features include:Adjustable Humidistat: This feature allows you to control the level of moisture in the room. Set the humidistat to your ideal relative humidity level. Once it reaches this level, the machine will automatically shut off.Built-in Hygrometer: This instrument reads the humidity level in the room, which helps you accurately set the dehumidifier to maximize water extraction.  Automatic Shut Off: Many dehumidifiers will automatically shut off when they reach the set humidity level, or when the water reservoir is full.  Automatic Defrost: If a dehumidifier is overly used, frost can easily build up on the machine’s coils. This can damage the components of the dehumidifier. An automatic defrost option will keep the machine’s fan running to melt the frost.  Rooms that feel damp and smell musty have a relatively high humidity level. Using a dehumidifier can restore the room to an ideal relative humidity. If the walls feel damp to the touch or have moldy patches, a dehumidifier should be used frequently.   A dehumidifier is necessary if you have experienced flooding in your home. Use a dehumidifier constantly to help remove excess moisture from the air.  People suffering from asthma, allergies or colds can benefit from a dehumidifier. A dehumidified room can enable some people to breathe more easily, clear up sinuses, and improve coughs or colds., Humid climates, especially in the summer, can produce uncomfortable conditions and damp-feeling rooms. Using a dehumidifier in the summer will help maintain a more ideal relative humidity level inside your home.   A dehumidifier works in tandem with air conditioning units, making your AC work more efficiently and keeping the room more comfortable and cool. This can also potentially result in reduced electricity costs.  Many dehumidifiers, such as compressor dehumidifiers, are not very efficient when the air temperature is lower than about 65 degrees Fahrenheit. Cooler weather increases the possibility of frost build-up on the machine’s coils, interrupting its efficiency and potentially damaging its operation.Desiccant dehumidifiers are effective for cold spaces. If you do need to dehumidify a cold space, you can purchase a dehumidifier specially made for working at lower temperatures.  Many dehumidifiers can be positioned against a wall if they have top-mounted air discharge. If your machine does not have this feature, you should make sure that you leave plenty of room around the machine. Do not place it against a wall or furniture. Better air circulation will allow your machine to work more efficiently.Aim for about 6-12 inches of airflow space around all sides of your dehumidifier., If you are using a hose to drain the water reservoir, place the hose so that it rests in a sink or tub and will not fall out of the sink. Periodically check to make sure that the hose hasn’t been moved and still drains properly into the sink. Use twine to secure the hose to the faucet if it doesn’t want to stay put.   Keep the hose away from electrical outlets and cords to prevent electric shock. Use the shortest hose possible. Someone might trip over a long hose.  Place the dehumidifier away from sources that create dirt and dust, such as woodworking equipment., The rooms that usually hold the most moisture are bathrooms, laundry rooms, and basements. These are the most typical places to install a dehumidifier.   Dehumidifiers can also be used on a boat while the boat is moored to a dock.  The most efficient use of a dehumidifier is to use it in one room with the doors and windows closed. You can install it on a wall between two rooms, but this can detract from its efficiency, causing the machine to work harder.  Many dehumidifiers are wall-mounted, but there are a number of models that are portable. If you can, place your dehumidifier close to the center of the room. This will help the machine work more efficiently., Some larger units, such as a Santa Fe Dehumidifier, are specially designed to hook into your HVAC system. These are installed with a duct kit and other installation accessories.   You may want to hire a professional to install a dehumidifier into your HVAC system.  Read through the entire owner’s manual for your machine so you are familiar with specific operational instructions. Keep the manual in a location where you can reference it easily.  A hygrometer is an instrument that measures the amount of humidity in the air.An ideal relative humidity (RH) level is approximately 45-50% RH. Going above this level may start mold growth, and below 30% RH can contribute to housing structural damage such as cracked ceilings, separated wood floors and other issues., Plug your machine into a three-pronged grounded and polarized outlet. Do not use an extension cord.If you don’t have the proper plug, hire an electrician to install a grounded outlet.   Always unplug the dehumidifier by pulling the cord at the plug. Never yank on the cord to pull it out. Do not allow the cord to become bent or pinched.  Depending on the model of dehumidifier, you may adjust the relative humidity (RH) level, measure hygrometer readings, and so on. Run the dehumidifier until you have reached your ideal RH level.  The first time you use your dehumidifier will be the most productive. You will be removing the majority of the excess water in the air over the first few hours, days or sometimes even weeks. After the first round, though, you will be simply maintaining an appropriate level of humidity rather than trying to bring it down drastically.   You will be able to set the amount of humidity that you desire on your dehumidifier when you plug it in.  The larger the space, the harder your dehumidifier will need to work. If you close off a room with the dehumidifier inside, it will only work to remove moisture from that room.   If you are dehumidifying the bathroom, consider where additional moisture can come from. Keep the toilet lid down so that your dehumidifier isn’t drawing water from the toilet.  Dehumidifiers produce a lot of water, depending on the relative humidity of the room in which it is operating. If you are not using a hose to drain the water into a sink, you’ll need to empty the water reservoir tray regularly. The machine should turn off automatically when the tray is full in order to prevent overflow.   Unplug your machine before dumping out the water. Monitor your reservoir tray every few hours if it is particularly humid. Check your machine’s manufacturer instructions to determine the approximate frequency for dumping the tray.  Read through the entire owner’s manual for your machine so you are familiar with specific care instructions. Keep the manual in a location where you can reference it easily.  Before cleaning or maintaining your machine, turn it off and unplug it. This will prevent the possibility of receiving an electric shock.  Remove the water drip reservoir. Wash it with warm water and a mild dishwashing liquid. Rinse it well and dry it thoroughly with a clean cloth.Clean this part of the dehumidifier on a regular basis, aiming for at least every 2 weeks. Add an odor-eliminating tablet if there is a smell that remains in the reservoir. These tablets are available at home supply stores, and dissolve in water as the reservoir fills up.  Dust in the coils can hamper the effectiveness of your dehumidifier, making it work harder and less efficiently. The dust can also potentially freeze in the dehumidifier, causing damage to the machine.Dust and clean the coils on the dehumidifier every few months to keep them free from dirt that can circulate through the machine. Use a cloth to wipe the dust away. Check the coils for any ice build-up as well. If you find any ice, make sure your dehumidifier is not resting on the floor, as this is where the coolest room temperature will be. Rest it on a shelf or chair instead., Remove the air filter and inspect it for damage every six months. Check for holes, tears or other perforations that may decrease its effectiveness. Depending on the type of air filter you use, you might be able to clean it and reinstall it in the dehumidifier. Other types need to be replaced. Check your manufacturer’s instructions for specific details about your machine.The air filter is typically located in the grill area of your dehumidifier. Remove it by opening the front panel and taking out the filter. Some dehumidifier manufacturers recommend much more frequent air filter checks, depending how frequently you use the machine. Check your manufacturer’s instructions for specifics regarding your machine., Avoid short cycling your machine and ensure the longevity of your machine’s operation by making sure the machine has been off for at least 10 minutes before restarting.	Choose the right size dehumidifier for your room’s square footage. Choose the right capacity for the dehumidifier. Use a large dehumidifier for a large room or basement. Buy a special dehumidifier for certain types of areas. Buy a portable dehumidifier. Consider which features you need on your machine. Use a dehumidifier when a room feels damp. Use a dehumidifier to improve health problems. Use a dehumidifier in the summer. Use only certain dehumidifiers in cooler weather. Allow air to circulate around the dehumidifier. Place the hose carefully. Keep the dehumidifier away from dust sources. Set up your dehumidifier in the most humid room. Install the dehumidifier in one room. Place the dehumidifier in the center of the room. Install your dehumidifier in your HVAC system. Read the owner’s manual. Measure your humidity level with a hygrometer. Plug the dehumidifier into a grounded outlet. Turn on the dehumidifier and adjust the settings. Allow the dehumidifier to run through several cycles. Close doors and windows to the room. Empty the water reservoir tray frequently. Read the owner’s manual. Turn off and unplug the dehumidifier. Clean the water collection reservoir. Check the machine’s coils every season. Check the air filter every 6 months. Wait 10 minutes before restarting your dehumidifier.
If you've purchased the netting from a craft or fabric store, it'll probably be jagged on the side that was cut in the store. Trim this edge using a square rule, yardstick or table edge.   Fold down the edge 5mm (0.19") on one side and stitch all the way along. Repeat for each edge of the netting, until you've stitched a hem on all of the netting. Fold again and stitch the new fold to cover raw edges. This final stitch around will also give a clean and sturdy line.   Fold the hemmed net in half. Do this lengthways. Pin this fold down 6cm (2.3"). Sew across the top down 2cm (1-ish inch), then sew a row 6cm (2.3") down.  It can be any height you consider appropriate but if you're looking for guidance, around 2 metres (2.1 yards) from the floor is good.  Be sure to check for wall studs before mounting the rod. If not, use a bolt or toggle to assist.  Gather as you push, until the whole mosquito net fits properly. To keep firmly in place, finish by pushing an acorn end onto the rod., Drape over yourself each night upon going to bed. Push it out a long way from your face and head so that it doesn't bother you. If the netting doesn't adequately catch itself to keep the open area shut, use binder clips or similar to keep it closed during sleep.  Tie back hooks and tie backs are optional additions but helpful for keeping the netting off the bed when not in use. Or, just tie it all in a loose hanging knot above your head.	Neaten the edges of the netting if needed. Hem around the entire netting. Make the slider pocket for the rod. Install the wall-mounted side drape rod according to the instructions provided. Gently push the rod into the slider pocket sewn earlier. Use.
Any combinations are fine but the weirder, the better. Some examples include:   Glue one large googly eye in the center of the pompom. Glue three small eyes in a triangle formulation. Don't use eyes. Use something strange like a banana button or a funny object.  This is optional, it's only if you have an alien that eats by mouth.   Use felt or other fabric to make a smile or frown. Use a zipper. Use a pipe cleaner piece.    Choose a pipe cleaner in the color you'd like to use for antennae. Cut it down to size. Shape into a "V". Glue to the back of the pompom (also known as the back of the alien's head). Antennae are now in place.	Add eyes. Add a mouth. Add antennae to the head.
If you know the date and time of your journey 2 weeks or so in advance, go to a local station or onto a rail website and book your ticket early. This could save you money or get you a reserved seat on a busy service.   Pack all of your luggage so that you can quick grab it to take it with you. Make sure that you can quickly grab those things that you might need to put in at the last available second. Make sure to have a good breakfast. Not all trains include food and drink cars.; , Chances are you'll experience a horrible feeling of panic if you see your train about to leave and you haven't got your ticket!  , Sometimes, the compartments are not sorted correctly and you might have to search for your train car. It is easier to do this from the platform than fighting through a crowded train., Follow signs to get to the platform and listen to the loudspeaker system for possible platform alterations. Bear in mind you might have to go up and down stairs, look for a lift if stairs aren't an option for you.  Put your luggage in the overhead racks rather than on the seat next to you as you may stop someone else sitting down. Just think how annoyed you'd be if you needed a seat and someone else was using up a perfectly good one for their bag or feet.  Now you have your seat you are in a good place to forget about everything and just be transported to your destination. It is a good idea to pay attention to the announcements so you have an idea of how many stops there are until you get off or if you are approaching your destination. But don't worry too much about whereabouts you are as it is usually announced when your stop is coming up. If there are no announcements ask the conductor for the time when the train is expected to arrive.  If you have lots of luggage try to get it all together and stand near the door ready to get off the train. If you didn't hear the announcement ask someone nearby which stop you are approaching so you don't get off at the wrong place! Remember to press the buttons near the doors to open them. They won't open on their own.  When a train is full people tend to sit in these seats. If a disabled person, or a pregnant women gets on, it is customary for those people in these seats to offer to get up.	Plan!, If you want to buy your ticket on the day of travel leave enough spare time to allow for queuing at the ticket office. Arrive early onto the train's platform. Ask staff or look at the departure boards to see which platform your train will leave from. Get on the train!, Relax. Get off the train. Look out for seats for disabled travellers.
Are you trying to shape a tree for shade or height? Has the tree been pruned recently? Before you begin, you want to consider what you are trying to achieve and set your goals.Your reasons for pruning will influence when you prune as well. You can do light pruning or remove dead wood at any time, but if you have larger goals, you'll want to plan your pruning around the seasons. For instance, pruning in the winter will result in an explosion of growth during the spring. Pruning during the summer will slow the growth of the cut branch, so it's a good strategy if you're trying to shape your tree or slow the growth of of branches you don't want.; , Spend a few moments looking at the tree's size and shape and imagining how it should look when you are finished.  Avoid removal of these branches.  Whether they were damaged by a storm or some other event, broken branches should be pruned so that the water and nutrients they're still taking from the tree get redistributed to healthy branches.  Remove branches that cross, then open the plant so that air might circulate and light reach all parts of the plant. In order for trees to grow healthy, they need good air circulation through and around the branches. Branches that are close together foster the growth of fungus and attract more insects.   Eliminate branches that are growing inward, toward the center of the tree. These cause clutter and are not healthy.  Whether they're low branches blocking your walkway or higher branches threatening your telephone wires, rubbing your roof, or overhang your house. It's fine to prune the branches that are causing some type of annoyance.  If you'd like your tree to have a more rounded or neat looking shape, prune a few branches that seem to stick out at odd angles; a few cuts will make a big difference.  Each cut you make compromises the tree protection system and opens the tree to potential fungus and insect infestation. Prune only as much as you absolutely need to prune, and never remove more than 25 percent of a tree's branches.   For most deciduous trees, make sure that there are living branches on at least 2/3 of the of the tree, though this varies by species. Be aware that the trunk alone is not enough to ensure that the tree will survive.Removing all the branches is highly stressful for the plant. Don't prune heavily more than once per season. Unless a storm breaks more branches, you shouldn't prune more than once, since the tree needs time to recover.  Pruning during the late fall or early winter puts less stress on the tree, since it minimizes sap loss. Pruning during this time of year is also better for the tree because it's less likely the "wound" you make will get infected by insects or fungus, which are also relatively active in the late fall and early winter.   A good time marker is to prune after the leaves have fallen off the tree. This means the tree is dormant until early spring. If a storm during a different part of the year causes a branch to break, it's OK to prune it immediately instead of waiting for winter.  This initial cut shouldn't go all the way through the branch. It is made to prevent the branch from cracking too close to the trunk of the tree when the weight of the branch is ready to fall.   The cut should be made on the branch side of what is called the stem collar. This is the small lip of bark that each branch protrudes from. You want to leave the collar intact, so don't cut flush with the trunk.  Your second cut will saw through the branch, on the outside (further from the trunk) of the first cut you made. Remove the branch from the area; what you have left is a stub., Now you can make another cut almost right against the stem collar. This gives the tree the best chance of healing in a quick, healthy way.   Be sure you don't actually cut off the branch collar. This must remain intact.  Although it is probably not necessary to disinfect your pruning equipment if you avoid cutting into cankers and obviously diseased portions of trees, it probably is better to be safe and disinfect your pruning tools with rubbing alcohol (or any household cleaner)after each cut of a diseased tree. You should also dip or rub the blades with a disinfectant impregnated cloth after the pruning of a healthy tree is complete, and before you move to the next tree or bush. Diseases are sometimes spread through dirty pruning equipment and pruning tools.	Think about why you want to prune. Assess the tree. Identify the major branches of the tree that make up its "skeleton.", Remove branches that show signs of damage first. Thin out areas that are thick with branches. Prune branches that act as obstructions. Prune branches to help shape the tree. Prune as little as possible. Take out your pruning tools in the dormant season. Make a cut on the underside of the branch. Cut off the branch several inches from the trunk. Make a precise cut to remove the stub. Clean your pruning equipment.
Turn the chair upside down and unscrew the seat from the chair.,  Remove the old seat cover. Lay the fabric for the new seat cover on a flat surface. Place the old cover on top of the fabric. Pin it to the fabric with safety pins or straight pins. Cut around the outline of the old cover.  Remove the old padding from the seat. Lay it on top of the new piece of foam or padding. Use a marker to trace around the old padding. Cut along the marked lines.,  Place the new fabric on a flat surface. The right side of the fabric should face down. Put the new padding over the fabric. Set the seat on top of the padding. Stretch the fabric to keep it smooth. Staple the fabric to the seat. Pull the fabric as you go around to eliminate wrinkles. Fold down the corners of the fabric. Staple them to the seat. You may also leave the corners unfolded if desired.  Screw the seat cover onto the chair. Ensure that the fabric side is facing up.	Remove the seat. Make a new seat covering. Replace the padding. Replace the seat cover. Attach the seat cover.
The type of flower you wish to fertilize, whether it is an annual or perennial, and whether it is new growth or an established plant will all play a role in determining when you need to fertilize. Determine the best time to fertilize your specific flowering plants.   Fertilize the soil for annuals, as well as any new planting, during bed preparation. Fertilize established perennials and ornamental grasses as soon as their growth resumes in the spring. Bulbs need fertilizing as soon as growth appears. Roses need fertilizing beginning in May but not after July. You do not want to encourage new growth as fall and winter approach.; , The simplest way to apply natural fertilizers is to spread them on the soil surface of your planting beds. Natural fertilizers take a much longer time to break down and release their nutrients available into the soil, so it is a good idea to apply them at least a few months before planting, if possible., Granular fertilizers are applied by sprinkling directly on to soil, or by using a spreader. You will want to turn over the soil to create an even distribution of granules. Granular fertilizers are longer lasting. They can remain in your soil for up to 9 months.  Water-soluble fertilizers are a type of powder that dissolves in water. This fluid-solution is then applied to your flowers. In can be sprayed directly onto the plants and soil. Water-soluble fertilizers remain in the soil for 2-3 weeks.  Annual flowers (those that complete their life cycle in one growing season) tend to need more fertilizer than perennial flowers (which return again each year.) , After your chosen form of fertilizer has been applied, you should water your flowers the way you normally do. It is important for your flowers to get a nice drink after they have been fertilized, but there is no need to overdo it.	Determine when to fertilize. Add natural fertilizers to soil surface. Apply granular fertilizer to your soil. Administer water-soluble fertilizer to your plants and soil. Pay extra attention to your annuals. Water your plants.

Your new wall coverings should work with what you’ll be putting in your home, so take a look at what you already own. Try to determine your style aesthetic based on what you’ve gathered so far.   If you plan to put up a lot of hanging art, don’t install a busy wall covering that will compete with it. If you have a bunch of modern furniture, an ornate print on a wallpaper might clash.; , Some people like to make a statement with their style, while others just want to add a little personal touch to the room. Which type of wall covering you choose should reflect how you like to express yourself. If you choose a bold pattern, then you might not be happy with it if that’s not your style.For example, bright paint colors or stenciling can create a bold, trendy look, but pale gray, tan, or white paint is more classic and easier to match with other room furnishings. Similarly, wallpaper is a more long-term style option than paint, so picking a bold print on a wallpaper is a big decision.  Grab a few home style magazines and check out the photos. Note the shared features in the ones that you prefer. For example, do you notice that you prefer a vintage feel or a modern aesthetic? Do you tend to go minimal, or do you like your home to be a richly furnished? Create a list of your design preferences to help narrow down your choice of wall coverings.   While it can be helpful to pull out the pages you like the best, don’t feel like you have make a project out of flipping through the magazines. Just look at a few spreads to find what you like.  If you’re really invested in expressing your personal style, go to the home and gardens section of your local bookstore or library to pick up a few books about creating a stylish home. You will be able to look at how other people have created your favorite looks in their own homes, often on a budget.   You can also find blogs and websites online that discuss home decorating topics, such as A Beautiful Mess. Check out Pinterest to pin a few of your favorite looks.You may also be able to use the preview function to flip through style books on Amazon. If you have a general idea about what kind of style you like, try googling a few keywords to pull up pictures of that style.  Wall coverings can be found in a variety of styles, from classic to trendy. Depending on your budget, the size of your space, and how often you redecorate, know if buying a trend is right for you.While it might be fun in the moment, next year you might find yourself trying to cover it up.   For example, prints such as chevron or animal print can be trendy and fashionable but then quickly go out of style, while soft colors like eggshell white, tan, or pale gray are classic and timeless. When choosing a print, think about how popular it is and how long it’s been around. If you’ve recently started seeing it everywhere, then it is likely a trend. Color schemes can also be trendy. If you are interested in a color scheme just because it’s fashionable, then it is likely a trend.	Look at your other furniture and wall hangings. Decide if you want to go for a bold look. Flip through magazines to see what draws your eye. Check out style books. Decide if you want something classic or trendy.
Whether your goal is to enhance the beauty of your home, or provide additional security, you have numerous lighting options to light up your home's exterior. Extend the hours you can spend outside, or create a festive environment!  , The selection of lighting fixtures is of two primary types: decorative and functional., The design of these fixtures should complement the look and feel of your house and landscape while providing sufficient lighting for safety, security, and functionality.   When installing a wall lantern, size the fixture to the door and surrounding space. Wall lanterns should be mounted slightly above eye level at about 60" to 66" from the center of the fixture to the floor. Post-top lanterns can be selected to match the style of the wall lanterns. Large post top lanterns make a better impression when used in large open space.  They spill light in all directions and can be a cause of light trespass (onto others' properties) and distracting glare for drivers. Many lighting designers forgo lantern style lights entirely and instead use lights with hoods (that shield the glare) and lights that are positioned within plant material so they are hidden completely.  They are strategically positioned around the property to selectively illuminate plant material and architecture. A skilled lighting designer positions fixtures so only the effect of the illumination is seen, not the lighting fixtures themselves.  Add landscape lighting, deck lighting, and step lighting to not only bring out the beauty of the home at night, but also add extra security and safety.	Use functional and fun lighting outside. Consider the types of lighting available. Use decorative fixtures are used along pathways, on walls and posts, and entrance foyers. Be mindful, however, that most lantern-style fixtures are glaring light sources. Use hidden lights for functional purposes. Include some lighting for security, too.
Samples can be collected from the field or purchased. Alternatively, any jewelry or scraps of metal can also be analyzed. The sample will not be harmed by the spectrometer., Little preparation is needed to analyze a sample with ED-XRF spectrometry. The results are extremely accurate and cost very little compared to other methods. The spectrometer can examine samples that are solid, liquid, or powdered., ED-XRF spectrometry is short for Energy Dispersive - X-Ray Fluorescence Spectrometry. This technology identifies elements and compounds by the way that they disperse light. Results will show the percent composition of gold in your sample. From that, you can determine how much gold is present given the weight of the sample.For example, if you had a piece of jewelry that was 100 grams and had a 70% gold composition, the piece would contain 70 grams of gold.	Collect a sample. Analyze the sample. Understand the results.
Ohana has short, light-brown, curly hair. If you have short, curly hair in the same color of Ohana's, then great! But if you don't, don't worry about it.

Capella's the really bright one in Auriga. It's very obvious, but don't confuse it with Vega, Deneb, Sirius etc. Aldebaran is the red one in Taurus.  It should look like two reasonably bright stars (Alpha Persei and Algol the demon star) surrounded by a smattering of dimmer stars. The left-hand bright star (closer to Capella) is Alpha Persei.  The other stars in the cluster should jump into view.	Find Capella and Aldebaran. Going up from Aldebaran and right from Capella should lead to Perseus. Look at Alpha Persei through binoculars.
It’s invasiveness is what makes it ideal for filling out beds or growing as lawn. However, you should be prepared to contain it if need be.; , It will look great overhanging retaining walls and stones.   The Silver Falls variety is light green to gray, while other Dichondra plants are a Kelly green color.  Flea beetles attach this plant in some areas, making it a poor choice.As is, it can be a difficult to maintain, yet, drought resistant type of lawn.  If your ground freezes, it is a good idea to choose bedding plants. Seeds should only be started outdoors when the temperature is at least 75 degrees Fahrenheit (24 degrees Celsius).  It will need steady temperatures over 70 degrees.  Wait the amount of time indicated on the package before you seed your lawn.  Feed lawn with an all-purpose lawn food.  Make sure that all areas are level, so that they drain well.  (0.5kg) per 500 to 1000 square feet (46 to 93 square meters). The heavier you seed, the faster it is likely to take root.  Cover it in a shallow layer of peat moss to hold moisture in and keep weeds out.  It should be moist, but never have standing water. Make sure you use a fine mist setting.  After 10 days, let the surface dry out more before watering. Gradually reduce the frequency with which you water.   Start to water deeply, but infrequently to develop the root system. The roots should receive at least one inch (2.5cm) of water each time. Dichondra is sensitive to over-watering and it can cause disease. Don’t allow the soil to become completely dry between watering.  Use a pre-emergent for weed control.   Don’t use broad-leaf herbicides on the lawn, since it will kill the plant. You may need to apply insecticides if heavy rain causes disease or bug problems., Set your mower height to 1.5 to 2 inches (4 to 5cm). You can cut it closer in the winter, but you should avoid cutting too much at once if the plant grows long.  Apply a weed killer if the area is overrun by weeds. Wait several weeks to plant the Dichondra.   You can also plant Dichondra in hanging baskets or use it in cut flower arrangements.  You can also buy bedding plants if you want them to fill out even faster.  Rake the area to loosen the soil.  Fill in the area with dirt. Press them lightly to ensure they are firmly implanted.  Then, wait until the soil is drier, but not completely dry to water again.  Try to avoid getting the fertilizer on the leaves of the plant or it may burn them.  This plant should be watered deeply but infrequently. It will grow from season to season and fill out the beds. They can trail up to six feet (1.8m).	Understand that Dichondra is a type of morning glory, and it is often considered a weed. Choose an ornamental Dichondra called “Silver Falls” or “Silver Dichondra” if you want a cascading groundcover. Ask your local landscape company or garden center whether it is good for lawns in your area. Decide if you will start the Dichondra from seed or purchase bedding plants. Wait until late spring or early summer to start your Dichondra grass. Consider laying down a weed killer, like Roundup, across the entire lawn if you have a lot of competing plants or weeds. Roto-till your lawn to a depth of six inches (15cm). Rake the surface free of any rocks or sticks. Broadcast the seeds at a rate of 1 lb. Rake the soil. Sprinkle the seedbed with water three to five times a day. Wait about two weeks for the Dichondra lawn to sprout. Fertilize the lawn with a nitrogen-rich compost or product every winter. Mow every two weeks. Choose an area that has full sun or partial shade. Plant the seed when temperatures are in the 70s or start them inside ahead of time. Ensure your soil is well drained. Plant the bedding plants to soil level. Water to a depth of one to two inches (2.5 to 5cm) the first time. Apply nitrogen-rich fertilizer. Don’t water too frequently.
You'll need the right team to achieve the lift:   One dancer to be lifted- this dancer must have optimal core strength.  Two dancers to do the lifting- they must contain some upper arm strength to provide a base, as well as core strength. One dancer in the back added to the lifting team to stabilize and help the person being lifted into the air. This girl is optional, but does make things easier.; ,   The lifted dancer should be in the front and middle, with all dancers facing the same direction. Two lifters should be to the side and with the optional one directly behind. The lifted dancer must stand with their feet in first position.  The two lifters must stand with their feet shoulder width apart, slightly offset. The back lifter should be standing in second position.    The lifted dancer should have their arms out in a strong second position, pushing the shoulders down and back, to create the necessary opposition to sustain the lift. The side lifters should have one hand near the armpit, as if creating a shelf, and one hand comfortably between the wrist and elbow. If the optional lifter is there, their hands should be firmly gripping the lifted dancer’s waist.    The lift should come from the knees. All participants should have set counts in their head for preparation, plié and lift. The lifted dancer must actively jump into the air as she is lifted, as her own momentum will help her get into the air. She must then hold her body tight and in the proper position. The side lifters must come from underneath the arms and push up.  The lift may last as long or as short as desired.   Counts must be agreed upon so everyone is in sync with what they are supposed to be doing, be it walking or holding still. The lifted dancer must hold their arms and body incredibly tight and in the desired position. The lifters should hold their arms locked straight, as it helps make the most of their strength and makes the lift easier.    Finishing the lift must end in sync. One side cannot go down before the other. The lifted dancer must be ready to be put down. As always, agree upon counts to ensure everyone is on the same page.	Prepare your team. Get into position. Ready the arms. Lift!, Hold the lift. Get down.

Note how the strings come off the grooves in the nut at the top of the neck, pass or bypass holders and the direction that they wrap around the tuners. This is very important for tone. You should have no less than 2 wraps around each tuner but no more than can fit around the tuner without overlapping.       ; , You can either take all the strings off at once and put new ones in all together, or do them one at a time. Some people prefer to change them one by one because it prevents changes in stresses on the neck. Others will periodically remove all the strings at once so they can clean the fretboard more easily. But that's your choice.  It will be bent on the end where it was stuck into the tuner.  Sometimes it will be difficult to grasp the end of the string to pull it out, so alternatively begin by pushing the string out then pulling.  There are MANY treatments available to clean your guitar with, pick whichever is your favorite.  If not, it still can be used to guide you in cutting the length of the new string.  Be careful not to damage the guitar finish. Pull the string completely through the bridge before laying it on the nut.  Finely wound or strings with coatings can be nicked or bent easier than one might think.  Wrap it around the tuner until there is about an inch left.  Correct it if necessary.  Make sure not to put the tip in before wrapping if possible, since doing this will twist the string and can lower its integrity and sound quality.  There should be at least two complete wraps present on the tuner, but still no more than can fit on without overlapping. The new string should sit on the bass just as the old one did. ,	Examine the head of your guitar. Loosen the first string via the tuner until the wraps on the winder begin to visibly relax. Once the string is loose enough, pull it from the tuner. Pull the string out either through the bridge or the body, depending on your particular bass. Clean the revealed portion of your bass guitar neck with a soft cloth or towel. Note if the old string had the correct number of winds around the tuner, use it as a template for cutting the new string of the same gauge to length. Pull the new string of the same gauge through your bridge assembly in the exact manner you removed it. Thread the string through and around guides, if any, being careful not to damage the string. Pull the string taut, tighter if you want but tension is not necessary here. Examine the wraps on the tuner; they should not be overlapping, but lay side-by-side nicely. Bend the end and poke it into the center of the tuner. Hold the end in the tuner and turn the key until it begins to pull tight, and bring it in close to tuned; a final tuning will be performed after all strings have been restrung. Replace the rest of the strings following the previous steps.         , Tune your bass guitar and play!
(Loosen them, cut them, and throw them away); , Just tap it around the sides on the edges.  You may have to make a new one from a blank. (You can get a blank from any local guitar store.) Try to match up the nut height with the old one only reversed. Place it in the slot (Don't glue it yet)  , (Mirror the strings)  , The string should be very close to the first fret. Touching or very close to touching. When the string is plucked open it should have no buzz in it. Adjust height until these have been met. If it is your first time it might be easier to have a few blanks.  (A dab will do ya!) The glue is to keep the nut from shifting, the strings will do most of the job in keeping it on.  Set the intonation.	Remove the strings from the instrument. Remove the nut from the guitar by gently tapping it with a regular (flat) screwdriver to break the glue. Some guitars you may be able to just flip the nut around. String the guitar reverse of right hand. Check nut height by tuning up the strings to pitch and pressing down on the third fret of each string. Slack (detune the strings) place a few dots of Elmer's glue under the nut. Retune the instrument. Rock.
Use a hammer to tap the top of the stake into the ground a half inch (12.7 mm) into the ground. The post should be one or two inches away from the tree or plant that you want to protect.If you are trying to protect a larger fruit tree, make sure that you get a long enough post so that animals won't be able to reach your fruit.  Press down on the edges of the sleeve and roll the sleeve lengthwise. This will help open up the wire mesh so that you can slide it over your fruit tree. Once it's rolled, unroll it and open up the mesh so it looks like a tube.  The wire mesh sleeve should fit over the stake that you put into the ground as well as your fruit tree. If the trunk of your fruit tree is larger, you may have to wrap the wire mesh around the tree.  Overlap the wire mesh on top of the post in the ground and carefully staple it one inch from the top and bottom of the post. Continue to add staples with a staple gun every inch apart until the mesh sleeve is securely fastened to the post in the ground.  If there is leftover mesh on the top of your tree guard, it could prevent the tree from growing. Use wire cutters to cut off any remaining mesh at the top and allow there to be a hole so that your tree can continue growing.	Drive a 4-foot (1.2 meters) wooden stake into the ground. Roll your mesh sleeve up. Slide the mesh sleeve around the post. Staple the mesh around the post. Cut off any remaining mesh on the top of your post.
You will need a go-kart frame that is capable of housing the size and weight of your engine. Most 5 to 7 horsepower engines will fit a standard size kart.The vertical shaft engine you choose can be from a riding mower or a push mower, either will work for your go-kart.   Larger engines in the 13 to 22 horsepower range, which you can find on riding mowers, may destroy the transmission or kart., You will want one that can support both your vertical shaft engine and lawnmower gearbox comfortably. Your gearbox should will need to have non-trans axle set-up.  This will give you a better sense of the dimensions that will be comfortable for your frame.   Most frames have a width that varies between 1/3 and 2/3's the wheelbase of your go-kart, with wider models giving better stability.	Measure the size of your engine. Pick a suitable go-kart frame. Draw out a true to size basic design of your frame with chalk.
Find the Escalator, if you are able to walk or use a pair of stairs. If not, the Elevator should be nearby.; , You'll meet up with the second floor.  Travel up to the fourth floor.  If you'd like to go in the reverse direction, you may, but realize that the monorail makes one complete loop between the resorts (Grand Floridian, Contemporary and Polynesian) and the parks, and you shouldn't have to go across to the other side to board (unless your room is on the opposite side, in which case, follow other method). ,	Walk out from the lobby area. Travel up the escalator. Find the nearby elevator. Walk out from the elevator and walk over to the level. Wait for the next monorail "train" to arrive at the station.  , Follow the instructions in Ride the Walt Disney World Monorail, to see how you can ride this monorail train.
If you notice that you have spider mites and want to minimize their damage to your plants, it's best to separate the mite-infested plants. Move them to a different part of your garden or indoors before you try to remove them., Water from a hose is strong enough to kill spider mites. Point a hose towards your plants and spray the leaves down with cold water. Remember to spray under the leaves as well so that you kill all of the mites., Keep the mite infested plants isolated for at least a month so that the spider mites don't spread to your other plants. Water from a hose is not strong enough to destroy spider mite eggs, so spraying the plants down once a week for a month will ensure that you kill the new mites that are hatching.	Isolate the affected plants. Spray down your plants with a hose. Repeat the process once a week.
Foil fencing requires rapid reflexes and lots of endurance. There is only one way to score in foil fencing - by touching an opponent's torso with the foil. Because the torso is such a limited portion of the body, opponents usually engage with one another in close quarters and the foil requires almost non-stop movement during combat.   In general, the foil is best wielded by an athlete who is shorter than average. The foil offers lively, engaging combat for those who are nimble and can think very fast on their feet., Rapiers have long, narrow blades that are ideal for an offensive cut-and-thrust style of fighting. The edges of a rapier aren’t that sharp, since the emphasis is on the pointed tip rather than the blade itself. They can slash and slice to some extent, but their main purpose was for lunging and thrusting.   Details can vary from rapier to rapier, but in general these swords are thin, lightweight and intended for unarmored single-combat. Rapiers were originally Medieval swords used by both the military and civilians., These swords originate from different time periods and cultures, but all of them feature a curved blade with a single sharpened edge meant for violent combat. They were sharp enough to slice off the limbs and head of an opponent in a single stroke.These blades could be used for combat in close quarters and also worked well if you were on horseback. Even when wielded by an unskilled swordsperson, these swords could cut through most armor and inflict massive damage and deadly wounds., The katana was one of the sacred swords of the Samurai. It features a long, extremely strong blade that is best used in combat on an open battlefield rather than close in close quarters. It was equally effective when fighting on the ground as it was on horseback.   The blade of the katana is slightly curved, single edged and usually at least 24 inches in length. Katana are some of the most revered swords ever to have been forged, made of very durable, high quality steel.They were and still are considered works of art.  These Medieval swords featured long grips that allowed the swordsman to wield it with both hands. The blade was usually double-edged and quite long, but the sword itself wasn’t overly heavy, so it was a very versatile weapon that could be maneuvered quickly and easily.   The longsword could slice, slash, cut and thrust with lethal force.Wielding a sword with both hands on the hilt allowed the swordsperson to deliver very powerful blows.  All martial arts can be dangerous, but the sword is particularly hazardous because of the sharpness of the blade. Train with good instructors and always handle your sword with the utmost attentiveness. One mistake could result in severe injury and even death.   Always keep your sword stowed somewhere safe when not in use. Small children should never have access to your sword in the house.	Choose a foil if you're an energetic, sharp-witted fencer. Use a rapier if you prefer a cut-and-thrust technique in combat. Slash and slice with the curved blade of the falchion, scimitar or sabre. Use the long, deadly blade of the katana for outdoor combat. Deliver a lethal blow with the force of a two-handed longsword. Exercise extreme caution when wielding a sword.
Sci-fi, adventure, mystery, non-fiction, fiction, realistic fiction? What authors do you like? Research books by authors you've enjoyed in the past. Chances are they'll have another publication that you'll also enjoy, and by searching by authors, you can get more of the same types of books that the author wrote.  Is there a type of book, or a specific book you would like to try? If there is, search the book up and read its summary. That will help you decide if the book is right for you.

Also by search your house, you can find books for yourself, that you can read, and it won't even cost you any money.  You can ask your older sibling, your mom, your dad, your best friend, or even your English teacher. Friends or family with whom you have things in common can often make excellent book recommendations. Local, small bookstores often have wonderful recommendations, and when they get to know you, it's even better! You should ask people that like the same genre of books that they have read, so that you can match books that you read.  Read the bestseller lists published in most newspapers or weekly magazines. Find out which new books are making headlines, and why.  Being a book club member is often a way to experience new books you might never have had the motivation to read otherwise. Joining a book club or making a book club helps you know who else likes the same books as you, and you can read books that others have read and discuss them.

If you would rather have book 1 over book 2, put book 2 back. Keep doing this. If you would rather have book 3 then book 1, put book 1 back, etc.  Chances are great that you'll like what they recommend. Make this list where you can see it, so that you can keep adding to this list as time goes on.This way you can see what books you have already read, and what books you really want to read.  These two sites have loads of free e-books that you can download, print, or read on your computer. If your school or library has its own e-books then you can go see them too from there.  Grab anything vaguely interesting off the shelves, check it out, and read it! You'll be surprised at what you like.,	Make a list answering these questions:   What genre of books do you like?, Search your house. Ask someone to recommend a good book. Read book reviews in newspapers and magazines. Join a book club. See if the library or bookstore has computers. Ask the librarian or book seller about the location of the books you're looking for. Skim through the shelves in the section you're interested in. Find a place to sit, or stand if you must, and read the first chapter of each book. Narrow down your stack. Research reading lists of your favorite writers. Go to websites such as Gutenburg.org or Gutenburg.ca. Go Random!,Gateway books (like Harry Potter or The Unfortunate Events) are great ways to keep your reading occupied while exploring other options.
Roses need between six and eight hours of sunlight each day. When choosing a location for your roses, pick somewhere that receives lots of direct sunlight.   In very warm climates, pick a location that gets indirect sunlight when the sun is at its hottest, between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. This could include near a tree that provides some shade during the hottest time of day. In cooler climates, plant the roses in front of a south-facing or west-facing wall or fence to give the roses some extra protection and reflected heat., Roses need to be watered deeply, especially during their first year and during the warmer summer months. Provide deep soakings twice a week in summer to keep the soil consistently moist.   The best way to water roses is with a drip irrigation system or soaker hose that concentrates water at the base and roots of the plant. If the flowers or foliage get wet, it could cause disease, fungus, and rot problems., Along with plenty of water and sunlight, roses also require regular feeding, especially before and during blooming periods. In the spring and summer, between the months of April and July, provide the roses with a monthly application of nutrients, such as:   Granular 5-10-5 or 5-10-10 fertilizerFish emulsions Seaweed extract Aged manure or compost Alfalfa meal  , Roses will thrive when they are pruned regularly, as pruning removes diseased stems, flowers, and leaves, and increases circulation throughout the plant. In the spring, use shears or loppers to remove dead flowers, diseased stems, and old leaves.Throughout the spring and summer, continue removing dead flowers and leaves as necessary.	Make sure they get lots of light. Water the roses often. Amend the soil with fertilizer. Prune often.
, Nippers will provide a much safer and cleaner cut for your tile. If using a hammer, always wear safety glasses and use a towel or other cloth to cover the plate or tile while breaking it.  Never use an older, dirty one even if you have cleaned it, since there will continue to be both dirt residue and moisture in the terra cotta which will affect the curing of the adhesive.  This will keep moisture from being drawn out of the adhesive during the curing process.  Mortar is the most reliable adhesive to use for outdoor areas or areas that are in contact with moisture. Mastic is not a good adhesive for this purpose as it does not adhere well over the long term. Never use any "pre-mixed" thin set product. It has a curing retardant in it in order to keep it from curing on the shelf and this means your mosaic will not cure properly in a decent amount of time.  Only work in areas you can finish at one time. Alternately you can place a small amount of mortar on the back of each piece as you set it. Make sure you are using enough mortar to hold the piece down but not so much that it squishes up into the spaces between the tiles where the grout will go.  You may draw the pattern onto the pot ahead of time with a pencil and follow the lines.  This usually is after 72 hours. , Otherwise, sealant is unnecessary.	Assemble your materials in a comfortable, well-lit work area; , Break your pottery with hammer and/or nippers. Use a new terra cotta pot. Use a good non-oil based primer to seal the terra cotta both inside and out. Mix a small portion of polymer modified thinset mortar (not the speed setting kind as this will set too quickly). Using a plastic knife or palette knife, spread the mortar over a small area of your pot. Place your crockery shards in a pleasing pattern. Apply grout to cracks between crockery shards after the mortar has cured completely. Use a dry rag (lint free) or very slightly damp tile sponge (not a kitchen sponge) to gently clean off the grout from the tiles without pulling it out of the cracks.  , Apply grout sealant after the grout has dried if you are concerned about staining. Display proudly.
Closed position is when partners hold each other while facing each other. The leader, usually a man, places his right hand high on the back of the follower, often a woman. The leader holds the follower's right hand high in his left, at about the follower's eye level.The follower places her left arm along the leader's arm, resting her hand on his shoulder. The leader's right hand is placed along the follower's shoulder blade. The follower's arm will rest on top of the leader's. Both partner's arms will be perpendicular to the floor., Sambas have a very specific rhythm. Count your steps this way: 1-ah-2, 2-ah-2, or 3-ah-4. You take three steps in two beats.   The second step, the ah step, is a quick step. Only part of your weight will be put into it. That makes the samba beat feel like bum-ba-bum., Your form will not stay stationary as you go through the steps. You will do the samba bounce as you perform the steps. As you step forwards and backwards, lift your feet like you are stepping over an object, like a log or pencil.Keep your upper torso relatively straight and your knees soft. As you step on count 1, step with a bent knee like you are stepping over something. When your legs get back together, keep knees soft and slightly bent as you shift your weight.   This is a fluid motion. It's like a slight uplifting motion as you move back and forth. Your body should bounce slightly as you go through the steps.  When dancing Latin ballroom, look straight ahead. The head should be stacked over your shoulders and hips.Think about the saying, "The nose shoulder follow the toes."   Look over your partner's right shoulder. This helps give you something to focus on as you dance., When you step on each count, the leader and follower will be going through the same steps, but mirrored. When the leader goes forward, the follower will go backwards. When the leader uses the left foot, the follower uses the right foot.   If you are the leader, take a step forward with your left foot on count 1. If you are the follower, take a step backwards with your right foot on count 1.Remember the samba bounce. Bend the knees and keep them soft while you go through the steps.  This next step, on the ah, is a quick step. Step your other foot right beside the one you moved in the previous count. Shift your weight to your other foot, making sure not to put full pressure on this foot. Then, on the 2 count, shift your weight completely back to the first foot. This should be done quickly.Your feet might seem like they are doing a march step as you complete this ah-2 count. Your weight will end up back on the foot you led with. If you are the leader, you will be stepping your right foot forward beside your left, then shifting partial body weight to the right foot during the ah count. If you are the follower, you will be stepping your left foot back beside your right, then shifting partial body weight to the left foot during the ah count. Let your hips sway as you bounce right and left while keeping your upper body still. This should put you back into your initial, neutral position.  Complete the same sequence of steps to the same count, but this time reverse them. The leader will be going backwards and the follower will be going forwards.   If you are the leader, step backward on your right foot, bring your left foot back next to it. Shift your weight quickly to the left on the ah count then back to the right on the 2 count. If you are the follower, step forward on your left foot, then bring your right foot forward next to it. Shift part of your weight to the right foot on the ah and then back to the left on the 2 count. When you step with the left foot, make sure you step with the ball flat against the floor. When you change to the quick ah count, quickly press with the ball of the right foot. When you step again with the left foot, make sure to keep it ball-flat., After you have mastered the basic and reverse basic steps, you can add a basic side step to your routine. The basic side step is completed exactly like the basic and reverse basic, except instead of going forwards and backwards, you step right and left.Start in the same closed position. If you are the leader, step right on the 1 count; if you are the follower, step left. Bring the other foot in so it is beside the foot that led. If you are the leader, you will bring your left foot in and shift partial weight onto it on the ah step. If you are the follower, you will bring in your right foot. Transfer you weight back onto your leading foot on the 2 count. Step sideways the opposite way. If you are the leader, you will step left on the 1 count; if you are the follower, you will step right. Complete the same steps.  Turn on some salsa music and go through these steps until they become automatic.  The progressive basic movement is a combination of the natural basic movement and the basic side step. Start by going through one measure of the basic move, then after you complete that, go into a side step instead of another basic. This allows you to travel around the dance floor., The whisk is a variation on the basic side step. Instead of bringing the other foot to meet your leading foot, you bring the other foot behind you.   If you are the leader, step to the right on the 1 count. Bring your left foot diagonally close behind your leading foot. On the ah count, transfer some weight back onto the foot diagonally behind your right foot, then the full weight back onto the right foot. If you are the follower, step to the left on the 1 count. Bring your right foot diagonally closer behind your left foot. Shift a small amount of weight onto your right foot on the ah count, then shift back fully onto the left foot.When you change directions, you will be stepping with the diagonal, back foot. The step will be a bit wider than in the basic step. Remember to keep light weight on the back foot. You are not just pointing the toe, but shifting weight from foot to foot. This step also is a type of march.  A stationary samba walk is completed in closed position with a two-hand hold, unlike the previous one-hand hold. The arms are extended. The leader has the left leg extended behind him, while the follower has the right leg extended behind her. The inside leg is the stabilizing leg. The partners don't travel anywhere, but remain in one area.   Bring the leg that is extended behind forwards to meet with the stabilizing foot on the 1 count. The leader will bring forward the left leg; the follower will bring forward the right leg. The arms will bend a bit as the two bodies draw closer together. Step the opposite foot back, with the toe turned out on the ah count. Part of your weight should be in your back foot. On the 2 count, slide your stabilizing, inside foot back about 3 inches (8 cm), placing all your weight back on the stabilizing foot.Step in and repeat the steps for the other side.  The samba walk is a travelling position done very similarly to the stationary samba walk, but in promenade position. Promenade position is very similar to closed position, except it's an open V position. The leader's left side and the follower's right side should be turned slightly open. The other side will be close together.For this move, start with the outside leg diagonal behind your inside, stabilizing leg.   Step the back leg forward in front of the inside leg on the 1 count. On the ah count, step the inside leg back, with the toe turned out. You should shift part of your weight to this leg. If you are the leader, you will start by stepping forward with the left leg, then step the right leg back; if you are the follower, you will use the opposite legs. For the 2 count, slide the front leg back about 3 inches (8 cm) and transfer all your weight to that leg. Step forward with the back leg on the 1 count, then step backwards with the other leg on the ah count. Make sure the toe is turned out and you shift part of your weight on it. If you are the leader, you will start by stepping forward with your right leg; if you are the follower, you will start with the left. Slide the front leg back about 3 inches (8 cm) on the 2 count, then transfer your weight to that leg. That completes the move for both legs. You should be travelling a little across the dance floor as you complete this move.	Assume the closed position with your partner. Feel the rhythm. Use the samba bounce. Look straight ahead.

Don’t just pick the first bamboo plant you find, but look for a healthy one. You can find Lucky Bamboo plants at your local garden center or nursery, and even some grocery stores.   It may be labeled one of the following ways: Lucky Bamboo, Ribbon Plant, or occasionally by its true name, Dracaena sanderiana.; , Caring for a Lucky Bamboo plant isn’t very hard, but if you get one that isn’t healthy, it will be much harder to care for and it may die. The size of the plant doesn’t matter too much here, as most of them will be fairly small.   It should be an even green color all over with no blemishes, bruises, or yellowing. The stalks should be a consistent color from the base to their tops. There also shouldn’t be any browning on the tips of the leaves.  Lucky Bamboo plants are very resilient, but if they have been planted incorrectly or have a sour odor, they could be sick, and won’t grow.Bamboo plants don’t have a fragrance like flowers do, but if they haven’t been watered properly, they can grow bacteria and develop a stink. Check the current water levels, and check to see if it has soil or fertilization. Many bamboo plants are grown hydroponically, just in water with small rocks or pebbles to hold the stalks in place. Some may be in soil, however, check to make sure that it is at least half full of water, or the soil is moist, but not soaked.  Too much soil or fertilization can actually harm your plant. However, if you are using tap water and it has fluoride and other chemicals, you may want to use soil and fertilizer to prevent yellow tips.If you are growing it in standing water, you will need some pebbles to hold it upright. If in soil, try mixing a third each of sand, peat moss, and regular soil to ensure excellent drainage. For water only, make sure that your plant has at least enough to cover the base of the roots. You should also change the water at least once per week to prevent the plant from rotting. It is a good idea to rinse the vase, pebbles, and plant each time you do this. If you are growing the plant in soil, water the plant just enough so that the soil is moist.  Your pot should be about 2 inches larger in diameter than the plant. Most Lucky Bamboo plants already come in a pot, but you can use your own pot to make the plant more your own.   A clear container works well for water and will show off your plant and pebbles, but make sure that you keep it out of direct sunlight. You can also use a ceramic pot and grow it in either pure water or in soil. If you use soil, plant the bamboo in a pot with a drain hole.  Too much fertilizer is worse than none at all, so use it sparingly. This is especially true of potted plants because the fertilizer will not become diluted by rain and can’t run off like it will for plants in the ground.  Your lucky Bamboo plant doesn’t need a lot of water. In fact, too much is bad for it.Water your plant about once a week and ensure that there’s a few inches at all times, enough to cover the roots. If you have soil in your plant, make sure that it’s not too moist or dry. Your bamboo plant can live well in just water, so over soiling or fertilizing can actually harm it.  Lucky Bamboo in the wild is usually shaded from direct sunlight by other, taller plants. You should keep your plant in an open, and bright area, but one that isn’t exposed to direct sunlight all day.To best care for your Lucky Bamboo, keep it away from windows that get a lot of light. Instead, place it in a part of your room not so exposed. Your Lucky Bamboo plant will also grow best in temperatures between in 65°F and 90°F.  If you wish to style the Lucky Bamboo plant, choose a few prime stalks to make a linked arrangement and put it on display. You can manipulate the stalks to grow around each other or curl with a bit of work; to do this you have to use younger stalks that haven’t grown a lot and hardened yet.You can simply plant your stalks in a line or rows if you want straight stalks. To curl your Lucky Bamboo plant, get a cardboard box and cut off the bottom and one side. Place the box over your plant with the open end facing your light source. Your stalks will begin to curl towards the light as they grow. Once you see a bend, rotate your plant. You can also wrap some wire around younger stalks crisscrossing them. As they grow you will add more wire to keep them stable as they intertwine.  Sometimes the ends of your leaves might turn yellow. This could be caused by a few factors: you plant isn’t getting enough water, there’s too much soil or fertilizer, or too much direct sunlight. You can trim off the yellow parts, or remove the whole leaf.   To remove the yellowed tips of your leaves, sterilize a pair of pruning shears or sharp scissors and with light rubbing alcohol or vinegar, then cut the yellow part off following the natural shape of the leaf. You can remove whole leaves by simply pulling them down off the stalk at the base of the leaf.  When one or two of your stalks gets too tall you can cut them and replant them. This will help you care for your Lucky Bamboo plant by ensuring that it doesn’t get too crowded and can produce new plants.   Take your longest stalk and remove the smaller leaves at the base of the shoot. With a sterile knife or scissors, cut the shoot about half an inch from where it connects to the stalk. Place the shoot in a bowl of clean, distilled water. Keep it in a shady area for about one to two months until it begins to sprout roots. Once you see roots, you can replant it the same pot as your bamboo plant.  People often tie a gold or red ribbon around the stalks of Lucky Bamboo plants to hold them together, and as an extra symbol of good fortune.   Add pebbles to finish off the look and hold the arrangement in place. Place your Lucky Bamboo plant somewhere where you will it enjoy day and remind you to care for it.	Find a plant that looks appealing to you. Pick one that’s a vibrant green color. Make sure it’s been planted properly and doesn’t smell. Decide between water or soil.There are advantages to both options depending on how much you are prepared to care for it. Choose the right container. Add a very light fertilizer periodically for quicker growth. Water sparingly. Keep your plant out of direct sunlight. Arrange your stalks. Remove dead or yellow leaves. Propagate your plant. Tie the stalks in place with ribbon wire or other ribbon.

To safely remove your old countertop, you'll first have to disconnect the water lines to the sink and gas lines to the stovetop. Turn the emergency shut-off valves for each fixture clockwise to the off position. Disconnect the supply lines from the valves using an adjustable wrench.; , Use your adjustable wrench to loosen the large nuts that hold the J- or U-shaped trap to the sink's main drain line. Hold the trap in place with channel locks. If you have a PVC connection, you should be able to loosen the connection by hand. If you have a garbage disposal, disconnect it from the sink, as well.  Be careful not to damage a sink or cooktop that you plan to re-install in your new countertop.   Undermount-style sink: If the sink is an undermount type, unfasten the screws holding it to the countertop. The sink should come out easily once it is freed from the counter. Have another person help you pull out the sink, particularly if it's an unwieldy double-bowl configuration. Drop-in fixture: Use a chisel or putty knife to pry the sink away from the countertop. Chop away at the layer of dried adhesive under the rim of the sink to free it. If the sink is fastened to a tile countertop, chisel away the quarter tiles along the sink's perimeter. Also remove any remaining mortar or adhesive. Get help to lift out the fixture, especially if it's large or heavy ceramic.  Determine how the countertop is fastened to the base cabinet. Typically, a clamp configuration using threaded fasteners is involved. Small countertops, like bathroom units, may be fastened to the base cabinet using adhesive. Use a pry bar to take off this type of construction.   Formica or laminate countertop: Most countertops are bracketed to the base cabinets. Remove the retaining screws inside the brackets and set them aside. If the counter is attached to the base cabinet with nails or an adhesive, use a pry bar to remove it. Start at a corner and pry the surface, lifting the countertop as you go. Tile countertop: Remove the tile from the surface. This frees the countertop and also reduces its weight, making it much easier to lift out. First, carefully pry the tile running up the backsplash away from the wall. Remove the rounded, bullnose tile along the front of the countertop. Repeat the process on the tile glued to the countertop, slicing between the mortar and wood underlayment. When the tile is removed, go under the counter and take off the brackets holding the countertop to the base cabinets. Lift the countertop off. Granite countertop: Most natural-stone countertops are heavy, and therefore, difficult to remove. They are either attached to particle-board underlayment or epoxied directly onto the base cabinets. The base cabinet can easily be damaged during the procedure. It's usually best to have a contractor do this type of removal.	Shut off the supply lines to the countertop fixtures, if applicable. Disconnect the drain line under the sink. Pull out the countertop fixtures. Separate the countertop from the base cabinets.
There are many different varieties of concrete blocks used for modern construction. You'll typically use standard 8" units, which will create the bulk of the foundation. Other types you might consider are single and double corner units, which provide a smooth square or rounded corner. Then you also have jamb blocks used for creating a doorway.Other special blocks are available for nearly every requirement you can think of. Sash blocks can be used when you want to create casement windows with an opening. Put header blocks at the top of a wall if you need to create space for roof supports or other construction supports. You can buy specialty blocks or even customize your building blocks to add a personal touch to your project.; , Footing is the concrete base that is used as the base’s structure. You can either use dry footing that requires you to mix it with water to activate, or purchase prepared footing.  This type of project requires a lot of supplies that can be found at your nearest hardware store. Be sure you can afford the time it'll take you to construct, and weigh the price difference of hiring professionals. Collect these supplies if you decide to continue:   Trowel Garden Hose 3/8" and 5/8" Plywood Work Gloves Level Wheelbarrow 100' of Chord Mortar Masonry Chisel 2x4 for Framing Tie-in-Bars Mortar Boards, If you're unsure about the specifics of what you should use for your project, consult a specialist at the hardware store. Typically the employees at the hardware store are knowledgeable about the needs of your project. It never hurts to ask if you're unsure.	Understand the available blocks. Purchase footing. Gather the basic tools. Ask a specialist.
Fermenting lawn clippings can create heat, and catch on fire. Barn fires start this way from bales of hay with no electricity; house fires have been started from a pile of lawn clippings.  Decks are flammable. Place non-flammable pads under your grill. Have a fire extinguisher readily available. Stay with your grill while cooking. Turn off propane if leaving, if even for a minute. After all, you'll be right back and can turn on the propane again.	Do not pile up lawn clippings near a building. Be careful using a grill on a deck.
The letters "S.R.S." stand for "supplementary restraint system," which means the Airbag is intended to be used along with your car's seat belts. Your seat belts are the primary restraint system protecting you in an accident. The seat belts in your car help keep you positioned safely so that, if you are involved in a collision, the Airbag won't injure you when it deploys. During a collision, a sensor in the vehicle signals the Airbag to ignite a fuse. This fuse explodes and produces nitrogen gas. The airbag deploys 50 milliseconds after a collision severe enough to warrant Airbag protection.; ,   The air bags in your car inflate very quickly. You or your children could be seriously injured or killed if you're sitting too close to an Airbag.. Push the driver's seat back far enough so that, if the Airbag deploys, you aren't injured by the force of deployment. You should have at least 10 inches (25.4 cm) of space between you and the airbag if it deploys. Ask passengers to push the front passenger seat back far enough so they won't be injured by the airbags deployment during a collision. Place a rear-facing infant car seat in the center rear set so the baby in the car seat is at a distance from the Airbag and the force of a potential collision. Depending on the laws in your state, children may be required to ride in the back seat until they reach a certain age or height. Because of their small size, a deploying Airbag can potentially kill a child.    Put your hands on the steering wheel in the 3 o'clock and 9 o'clock positions so you protect yourself from broken bones if the Airbag deploys. ,,	Understand how an Airbag works during a collision. Position yourself and your children safely in your car. Learn how to handle an air-bag equipped steering wheel. Tow your car to a repair shop once it has been in a collision strong enough to cause Airbag deployment.  , If your air bags have unexpectedly deployed, pull your car to the side of the road as soon as you safely can.  , Schedule maintenance for your car as soon as you can if you get a recall notice regarding faulty air bags.
Every Barnes and Noble Nook is accompanied with a power kit, which includes a power adapter and USB power cord. Together, these two parts comprise the wall charger. Every version of the Nook has a specific USB cord; using a cord from a different make and model may damage your device., The power kit comes disassembled. Unwind the USB power cord. Insert the large end of the USB power cord into the slot on the face of the power adapter., The small end of the USB power cord is called a micro USB. Insert the micro USB into the micro USB port on your Nook—this is usually located on the bottom edge of the Nook. Plug the power adaptor into a wall outlet.Some versions of the Nook do not have a USB power cord with a micro USB. If this is the case, the part that is inserted into your nook will be larger than the traditional USB.  A small LED light will illuminate to confirm that your Nook is indeed charging. If your Nook is completely dead, it will take anywhere between 3 to 6 hours to fully charge your device. When your Nook is fully charged, the indicator light will turn off. Unplug your Nook and remove the power kit from the wall.   If you charging your Nook for the first time or your battery is completely dead, it may take up to 30 min for your indicator light to turn orange. This is normal.	Obtain the correct Power Kit for your Nook. Assemble the power kit. Connect the power kit to your Nook and a wall outlet. Wait for your Nook to charge.
To start off your Lawliet cosplay, you will need a basic pair of blue jeans and a plain white, long sleeved shirt that doesn't have too tight a neckline, and is basically round cut. V-neck shirts will not work properly if you wish to be L. The jeans can vary, as long as they fit your body comfortably with the waist band resting just above your hips or in that general area.; , If your hair does not qualify to suit L at the black and ragged shoulder length cut with bangs, you have two options. One, you can cut and dye your hair, or two, you can buy a wig. With either option, the hair you need must be black, and slightly longer on the left than it is on the right. Not too much difference, only about a half inch to an inch or so. Keep the parting of the hairline to the left and the bangs in the front over your eyes. Make sure you can still see though, because L doesn't walk into stuff.  As everyone knows, L has black bags under his eyes. It is not suggested that you stay up for long periods of time to obtain these bags, but rather get black eyeliner and smudge it under your eyes to give the appearance of bags. Try to avoid sparkly makeup. Also, if you have prominently dark brows, try an eyebrow pencil in a slightly lighter shade to help make them less prominent. L practically has no eyebrows. Also, if you have a uni-brow, it is highly suggested that you pluck or wax it.  To obtain L's posture while walking, try to be slouched and always look at the ground. Walk like you have back problems and can't quite stand up straight. Keep your hands in your pockets, but only while walking or standing. When sitting, sit in an almost crouched position with your hands resting palms down on your knees. Again, keep slouched, even in the chair.  L is very passive and doesn't have many strong emotions to exclaim to the world, so to be L, you have to keep your emotions in check. Only smile slightly when you are pleased about something, and if someone insults you, just be passive or respond with a question regarding the insult. Do not take offense. If you do, do not show it in any way. They're just words, there's no need to get all upset over them.  L has a few habits that make him especially unique. To be L, try to make a point of chewing on your thumbnail and touching your lips often. Lawliet also itches his right leg with his left foot, while standing. It takes practice to get it right. To pick things up, use a maximum of three fingers unless it can't be avoided (example; cell phone, book, paper. He writes with holding the eraser side of a pencil or marker, but most people can't do this and write fancy too.) both hands right in front of your face. Remember, L eats a lot of sweets and strawberries, but try not to get too carried away with that, because you could get a stomach ache or a cavity.	Get the clothes. Style your hair. Do the face. Pay attention to your posture. Lose the attitude. Learn his habits.
Mix until the borax dissolves.  Stir together using a large craft stick.  Fold and mix well with a craft stick until the mixture is gooey and resembles slime. , Add a couple drops of fluorescent paint into each bowl, making a rainbow of colors. If you want dark rainbow slime, add 10-15 drops, but if you prefer a lighter rainbow slime, add 6-10 drops.  Place the black light on and have fun playing with the glowing rainbow slime and looking at its bright colors. You may like combining multiple slime colors to make the slime really resemble a rainbow (but be careful not to fully mix them together, or the slime will turn gray).	Combine only the 1⅓ cup of warm water and the borax in a small bowl. Mix the rest of water and the glue in a separate bowl. Pour the borax mixture with the glue mixture. Roll the slime into six medium-sized balls and add them into six small bowls.  , Add different paint colors into each bowl. Enjoy!
There are a variety of inexpensive options available. Germinating flats are cheap and specifically created for the purpose of germinating seeds. Plastic drinking cups and recycled egg cartons are other inexpensive options, however. Small flower pots will also work.; , The best containers are four or more inches deep. This allows the root system to develop.  If using an old plastic pot or tray, soak it in a solution containing one part bleach and nine parts water, and rinse thoroughly. If using a new container, sterilization may not be necessary.  Most plastic pots and germination trays already have holes in the bottom for water to drain through. If using a plastic cup, egg carton, or another container without any holes, punch a small hole or two in the bottom of the container before filling it with soil.  Typically, this means starting them 4 to 8 weeks before the expected last frost. Doing so gives your seedlings plenty of time to develop prior to the transfer, making them strong enough to withstand winds, insects, and other pests.  Peat moss pellets work well with germination trays, but a good soil might be necessary if using a larger container. Purchase a pre-packaged soil from a garden center to ensure a high-quality "sterile" mix. Many stores even sell special "seed starting" blends.  Do not pack the soil down. Instead, allow it to remain loose.  Add enough water to get a spongy wet consistency, but do not completely saturate the soil.  Some flowers require you to cover the seeds with up to an inch of soil, while other small seeds may only need to be sprinkled on the surface of the soil. Do not pack soil on top of the seeds, however, since doing so will smother them and make it difficult for sprouts to break through.  Space them 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) apart to prevent them from interfering with each other if more than one seed grows.  Only add a small sprinkle of water to moisten the seeds and the new soil. Do not drown your seeds.  If using a germination tray, it likely came with a clear plastic cover. Otherwise, use clear plastic wrap. The cover prevents your seeds from drying out, but it must be clear to allow adequate sunlight through.  The location should also be well-ventilated, however. If you want to prevent the air from getting too stagnant, run an electric fan in the same room near the seeds, but do not point it directly at the container. Only run the fan for a few minutes at a time.  Typically, you should place the seeds near a window but not in direct sunlight.  Some seedlings need up to 16 hours of light a day in order to develop. If so, shine a fluorescent light a few inches above the tallest leaves during the hours when no sunlight is available.  Relocate the seedlings to a location with better sunlight.  This prevents the seedlings from bending in any one direction to reach the light.  Use a spray bottle if possible. Gentle watering prevents damage to delicate, developing root systems.  If you press your finger into the soil and feel moisture, you may want to wait before watering again. Keep the soil moist but not soaked.  Use a mild fertilizer. If possible, purchase one designed for young shoots.  Expose them to direct sunlight and outdoor air for a few days in their current containers. Keep them moist and protect them from the wind. Bring the plants in at night, especially if the nights are still cold.  Refill the hole to the same depth as your pot or container using loose soil. The purpose of digging out the soil and refilling it is to ensure that the soil remains loose enough for your flower's roots to adapt.  You don't want to completely saturate the hole, but you should add enough water so the soil is a bit spongy.  Tap on the bottom and sides lightly until you can remove the soil from its container without forcing it.  The root structure should be solid enough that the plant retains the shape of the container it was in.  Make sure that your plant is firmly seated, but do not pack the soil tightly.  Do not soak the flower, but make sure that it is moist.	Choose a container. Make sure your container provides enough room for your seeds to develop. Sterilize the container. Provide adequate drainage. Start your seeds indoors 4 to 8 weeks before you plan on transferring them to your outdoor garden. Select your soil. Fill your container three-quarters full with your selected soil. Moisten the soil before adding the seeds. Follow the instructions on your seed packet to plant the seeds. Drop two or three seeds into each container. Water again. Cover your container. Place the planted seeds in a draft-free location. Follow the instructions on the back of the packet regarding temperature and sunlight. Supplement sunlight if necessary. Remove the covering once the seedlings show two complete sets of leaves. Rotate the container every two or three days. Water your seedlings with gentle spritzing instead of heavy drops or streams of water. Test the soil with your finger to determine whether or not it needs watering. Add fertilizer once your seedling develops a few leaves, if desired. Harden seedlings before transplanting them. Dig a hole in your garden twice as deep as the pot. Add water inside the hole. Turn the pot with the flower in it on its side. Place the plant into the hole. Hold the plant down with one hand and use your other hand to fill in the rest of the hole with dirt. Add more water.
, Smooth out any wrinkles.   Iron if needed.  Use good quality fabric scissors for a clean cut.  Measure at least 7.5cm or 3 inches from the base of the t-shirt to reach the bag's base point (everything below this gets turned into fringe). Draw a line across the point chosen, using tailor's chalk or other fabric sewing marker.   Do your best to include all of the logo or picture at this stage; cutting it off to be part of the fringe won't look that effective.  Place these at 2.5cm/1 inch intervals. These form the fringe.  Cut all of the vertical lines up to the horizontal line. Do not cut beyond the horizontal line.   This includes cutting open the sides of the t-shirt from the base to the horizontal line.  Cut as close to the seam as you can manage.   For the neck hole, you may choose to leave it or cut it. Estimate how much space there is to fit in groceries before deciding. Always undercut the neck space; you can always cut more if needed.  Tie front and back fringe strips together using square knots. Do this right across the bag until all the fringe strips are tied in place. This will make the base of the bag. If you don't like the small gap holes this process leaves, run a line of stitching across the base, just above the tied fringe.  This step is optional but pretty. You can tie on beads, bells, etc.  The bag is now ready for carrying your groceries.	Find a good old t-shirt with a nice logo or an interesting pattern.  , Lay the t-shirt out flat with the logo facing up. Cut off the bottom hem. Choose the bag length. Draw a series of vertical lines extending down to the new bottom of the t-shirt, from the horizontal line you just drew. Cut the fringe. Cut off the arms and neck of the t-shirt. Tie the fringe strips together. Add baubles to the fringe pieces. Done.
If you’ve tightened or replaced screws, filled stripped holes, and tried shims, but the door still sags, you’ll have to plane or sand. Scribing, or marking, the door will give you the line at which you stop removing wood by planing or sanding. First, use a carpenter’s compass to draw a line an 1/8 inch from the edge on the side of the door that rubs against the jamb. Trace the line with masking or painter’s tape to make it more visible.A carpenter’s compass is the easiest tool to use, and is inexpensive. If one’s not handy, use a pencil and straightedge. Fix the masking tape to inside of the line you marked off: for example, if you scribed the left side of the door, fix the tape to the right side of the line.  You don’t need to bother with unscrewing the hinges from the door face. You’ll be sanding or planning the strike edge rather than the hinge, so just pop the hinge pins and remove the door. Take the door to an open area, like a garage, and store it on a level surface, like sawhorses or a worktable.  Using a belt sander is a great option. For the first 1/16 inch, use an 80-grit sanding belt. Keep the sander moving so you don’t wear a hole in one spot. Switch to 150-grit for the second half, then a 120-grit belt when you’ve gotten to the line in order to smooth it out.Remember, the humidity that causes the door to swell and stick at the bottom may disappear and leave the door too short during dry spells. Don’t remove too much of the door. You might reattach the door and find you haven’t planed enough, in which case you’ll have to repeat the process one or more times. Remember you can take away more door but you cannot put back what you’ve already removed, so sand carefully. If you’re sanding the latch edge of the door, be sure to first remove the latch hardware. You may have to use a sharp chisel to dig out the latch hole so it doesn’t protrude from the door after planing. If it sticks out a bit, you can often sand or plane it down in place., When you’ve determined that the door has been properly planed, remember to refinish and repaint the raw edge. Don’t do so until you’re sure you’ve finished sanding. A coat of varnish and paint will help prevent moisture from penetrating the wood, so you’ll be far less likely to have to fix a sag in the future.	Scribe the door. Remove the door. Sand or plane the scribed edge. Refinish and repaint the sanded edge.
Precursor is the material that you use to make the carbon fiber. Almost all carbon fiber is made from a polyacrylonitrile precursor. You should dissolve the polyacrylonitrile in an organic solvent such as dimethyl sulfoxide., Once the precursor is dissolved, you put it in a coagulation bath. Then, run the slush through a spinneret. The material is forced through the fine holes of the spinneret to create long strands., Oxygen is needed to crosslink the polymers and make them more suitable for fibers. To oxidize the strands, heat them in an oxidation oven that ranges from 200 °C (392 °F) to 300 °C (572 °F). You must maintain appropriate airflow during this process to avoid catching the strands on fire., Once oxidized, the strands must be heated in an oxygen free environment. Since there is no oxygen, the strands will not burn. Instead, they undergo a process called pyrolysis, which removes almost all impurities, such as organic solvents. A series of pyrolysis ovens are used that range anywhere from 700 °C (1,292 °F) to 1,500 °C (2,730 °F)., Pyrolysis leaves you with carbon fiber threads. Before being shipped to customers or processing plants, the threads must be treated. This includes etching the fibers with an acid, such as nitric acid. After etching (referred to as treatment) the fiber is coated in a process called sizing. The coating increases the size of the fibers and makes them more sturdy for processing and customer use.	Dissolve the precursor. Spin the polymer. Add oxygen. Pyrolyze the polymer chains. Treat the fibers.
It is difficult to predict if the venue will be too warm or too cold, though you can usually bet on it being hot if it’s going to be a huge, crowded concert. To keep warm on your way to and from the concert during colder months, wear layers, such as a t-shirt with a bomber jacket over it. The bomber jacket is lightweight but will keep you warm if you need it. It can also be easily tied around your waist if you choose to ditch it in the middle of the concert.If you are attending a more subdued concert, it may be cooler inside the venue than you may expect. Wear either a lightweight jacket or a thick sweater over a shirt to ensure you stay warm during the concert, if you need to. Attending a concert is a great excuse to break out one of your favorite band t-shirts.  Lively concerts will often have everyone dancing and even moshing. Protect your feet and toes by wearing a pair of sturdy, yet stylish boots. If attending a rock or pop concert, try a pair of combat boots, which are stylish while still being heavy duty enough to protect your feet and keep them warm, if necessary. If you are attending a country concert, you can simply wear your favorite pair of cowboy boots. A concert in which everyone will be seated for the majority of the time will not necessarily require you to wear closed-toe shoes.  You will want to incorporate powder into your makeup routine to stay looking fresh throughout the concert. Stay away from liquid and glossy products, as they will fade quickly as you sweat and could even smear. Finish off your look with a translucent setting powder to ensure that your makeup stays and does not rub off as you sweat. Keep the powder with you in your bag so that you can touch up as needed.   Opt for a powder foundation, such as Bare Minerals, to ward off shine throughout the concert.	Wear layers. Choose comfortable, closed-toe shoes. Apply sweat-proof makeup.
When people are watching on TV or in the theater, they'll be thinking, "Wow, that character is kinda weird!" not, "Wow, that actor is really weird." When acting, just imagine that you're not 'you' anymore, you're the character.; , No one else is watching you, you're alone on the set, practicing your lines. , Try to fool the others into thinking you aren't embarrassed at all, and you may end up fooling yourself as well.  Take a deep breath before walking on set, calm yourself, and tell yourself that you're a great actor, and there's no reason to be embarrassed about your acting.	If you're acting as a certain character, you shouldn't be embarrassed at all. Imagine that you're the only person on set. If you're only comfortable acting in front of one or two people, like your best friend or parents, imagine that you're simply reciting your lines in front of them.  , Be confident about your acting. Just relax.
As mentioned above, you will need the Comfort Access Remote to be inside the cabin to start your BMW.; , The brake must be depressed before starting your BMW.  This is only necessary for manual shift models, as automatic shift models do not have a clutch.  This will start your engine.Be aware that you should not hold the Start/Stop button in as it will erase the key codes. If this happens you will have to go to the dealer to have them reset.  If you have the park brake set, you will need to release it before you can pull out.  Shift into either drive or reverse, whichever is appropriate for pulling out of your parking place.  You have now started your BMW and it’s time to hit the open road.  Find yourself an appropriate place to park your car and take it. Be sure to pay any meters or costs associated with the parking space to avoid your BMW boasting a parking ticket upon your return.  This is especially important if you are driving a standard or have parked on a hill.  If you are driving a manual shift, you will shift into neutral.  This will turn off your engine., It doesn’t matter if it is in a pocket, briefcase, or purse as long as you have the remote on your person. The Comfort Access Remote is also sometimes referred to as the Key Fob, and is the key for your vehicle.

Consider purchasing a professional kit if the scuff is more than just superficial or if you’re dealing with scratched vinyl. The kit will include a glue to fill in the deep scuff or scratch, an activator to dry the glue, and a dye that matches your vinyl color.You can order a scratch removal kit online for about 50 US dollars. Your kit will come with a factory-matched dye to blend in with your vinyl color. When you order your kit, you can search for your car’s make and model to identify the correct vinyl color., Use a piece of 220 grit sandpaper to smooth over the scratch or deep scuff. Try to remove any roughness around the scratch so its edges are flush with the vinyl surface.Some scratch removal kits provide sandpaper. If you don’t have any fine grain sandpaper on hand, you can check kits’ contents before ordering and purchase one that supplies sandpaper.  Wipe down the area with a damp cloth. If the area is greasy or grimy, clean it with a homemade vinegar solution or store-bought auto interior cleaner. Use a clean microfiber towel to dry the area., If the area is still at all damp after wiping it down with microfiber, wait for it to dry completely before applying glue. Dab a small amount of the superglue that came in the scratch removal kit. Smooth the glue over the scratch using a narrow palette knife.If your kit provided a glue activator, apply it over the glue to instantly harden it.  If you haven’t used an activator, wait for the glue to dry completely. Use your 220 grit sandpaper to smooth over the glued surface. Then wipe down the area with a damp cloth, and dry it with a microfiber towel., The dye will come in an aerosol sprayer. Spray a light, even coat over the patched area, and hold a piece of cardboard under the area to help protect surrounding surfaces. Wait for the dye to dry, and reapply until you’ve achieved even coverage.If you have a heat gun handy, you can use it to dry the dye faster. Hold it about 12 inches (about 30 cm) away from the dyed surface.	Purchase a complete scratch removing kit. Sand the scratched area. Clean the area after sanding. Apply glue to the scratch and spread. Sand and clean the glue when it’s dry. Apply multiple light coats of factory-matched dye.
She is observant and tactful. As seem in the Chuunin exams, she can think her way out of a tough spot.  Make everyone around you know who's the top dog.  (For example, she's often shipped romantically with one of her brothers, or both. She's also been paired with Chouji, Sasuke, Sakura, Ino, and many others.) Remember, her personality is rather ambiguous, so it can be assumed that she would fit well with just about anyone.  Blushing and smiling a lot is very unlike Temari. ,	Temari is very intelligent!, Use a tough attitude. The most typical Temari couple is Temari x Shikamaru, but there are many possibilities out there. Have a cocky smirk on your face most of the time. You should rarely ever be surprised.  , Think that you are better than most people.
, This is to clean it for use.,, Gently press down to ensure that it is sitting exactly in the position you'd like it to show., Spread onto the remaining area of the flat side of the cabochon too., Put the flat side of the cabochon onto the square, pressing firmly to form a backing. The cabochon must fit within each edge of the cardboard but don't worry about the edges sticking out––they'll be trimmed away shortly., You can place a heavy book on it to help it to adhere well at this stage., Shape the cardstock around the cabochon so that it fits it exactly and neatly., Place the cabochon onto it, rounded side facing downward. Paint the sealant onto the base of the cabochon (flat side). Brush one way and cover the edges carefully., Then repeat but brush in the opposite direction this time. Allow to dry again. Then pull away from the newspaper., Using nail polish remover, rub off any sealant or Mod Podge that has dripped onto the rounded surface of the cabochon. Any stuck newspaper can also be removed in this manner.  Use kitchen towel or toweling for this. , Use glue on both the back and the brooch pin. Hold in place for a minute or two, then leave to dry overnight., The pig pin brooch cabochon style is now ready for wearing.	Cut the cardstock into a 3 inch x 3 inch/7.5cm x 7.5cm piece. Wipe the flat side of the cabochon using paper towel or toweling.Spread a generous amount of the Mod Podge onto the flat side of the cabochon (just cleaned). Place the image of the pig onto the Mod Podge, image side facing down onto the flat side of the cabochon. Spread a new layer of Mod Podge over the back of the pig image. Place the cardstock square onto the work surface. Allow to dry for at least half an hour. Trim away the excess edges of the cardstock once the Mod Podge has dried. Spread the newspaper out over the work surface. Allow to dry completely (about half an hour to an hour but check the manufacturer's recommendations). Turn the cabochon over.Polish the rounded part of the stone with a tissue or clean toweling. Add the brooch pin to the flat side of the cabochon. Done.
Start with a card that says all the words you need to. Put your messages where you want them to go, so you know where your center design will go. Make sure nothing you want to be visible will be underneath your centerfold design.; , Picture a spot around the centerfold that you want to be covered by flowers. Draw a rough outline around this spot so you know what spots it will cover. It should start at the bottom of the card and extend upwards and outwards, like the shape of an ice cream cone.  You don't want your centerfold flower to be wider than your card. Fold your card shut and measure the width.The widest part of the pop out flower should not be more than this amount.  The top dimension should be no wider than your card's width (when closed). You can make a centerfold design much smaller than this, however. As long as your design is not wider than the width of the card, folded, you can place it at any height on the centerfold.  This is where you use markers or construction paper to create a design. It is advisable to make it symmetrical, but you don't need to. Keep track of the design you will want to cut out of the top once you have finished drawing the design.   After you're done, cut any excess paper from the top and sides. Erase and pencil marks you made to plan for the centerfold design. Fold your design in half.  Lay out your card and your centerfold design. Line up your centerfold design with the crease of your card. Rubber cement will hold your centerfold the best, but standard glue will work as well. It will make your card more secure to fold an inch along edges of the triangle so it doesn't come off the card., You want to fold the triangle the opposite direction of the way the card folds. In other words, if you open the card, the triangle should pop out toward you. Now glue the flowers on the triangle. If they are going over the center crease of the triangle, fold them as well so they will not get damaged when the card closes.  Once the glue holding on the triangle and flowers have dried, carefully close your card. When it is opened again, the flowers will pop up. The centerfold flower is different from the regular pop out flower.	Create your design. Draw an inverted triangle on your card. Measure the dimensions of your centerfold flower. Cut a triangle out of construction paper. Draw your design. Glue the edges of the centerfold to your card. Crease the center of the triangle and glue on flowers. Carefully close your card.
In the Northern Hemisphere, the Pleiades star cluster becomes visible to evening observers in October and disappears in April. November is the best time to look for the Pleiades, when they are visible from dusk to dawn and reach their highest point in the sky.In early October, the Pleiades become visible a couple hours after sunset. By about February, the Pleiades are already high in the sky at sunset.(The exact timing depends on your latitude.) The Pleiades are visible in late summer and early autumn as well, but only in the middle of the night.; , The Pleiades rise in the southeast after dusk and travel west during the night. During their peak in November, they climb high in the sky and disappear in the northwest before dawn. In late winter and early spring, they will only be visible for a few hours, traveling east to west across the southern part of the sky., Orion the Hunter is one of the most famous and distinct constellations in the sky. On a winter evening at a mid-northern latitude, he stands almost due south, about halfway between the horizon and the sky directly above your head.Locate him by his belt, a straight line of three bright stars close together. The red star nearby, Betelgeuse, forms his left shoulder (from your perspective), while the blue giant Rigel on the other side of the belt is his right leg., Treat Orion's belt as an arrow pointing to your next landmark, moving from left to right in the sky. (At most times and places, this will point to the northwest.) The next bright star you see in this direction is another bright, red-orange star: Aldebaran. This is the Arabic word for "Follower," likely named because it chases the Pleiades each night.Aldebaran is not in a perfect line with the belt. Don't try to get there with binoculars, or you may miss it. Aldebaran dips below the horizon around March, or earlier in extreme northern latitudes.If Aldebaran isn't visible, try to follow Orion's belt all the way to Pleiades.  Continue moving your eyes in the same direction (usually northwest), from Orion's belt to Aldebaran and beyond. Fairly near to Aldebaran, you should see a tight cluster of blue stars. These are the Pleiades, also called the Seven Sisters or M45.Most people can only see six stars with the naked eye, or even just a hazy clump if light pollution interferes.With a clear night and keen, dark-adjusted eyes, you may see more than seven. The Seven Sisters are clustered close together. From end to end the cluster is only ⅔ the width of Orion's Belt.This is much less than the length of the Big Dipper or Little Dipper, star patterns which some novice stargazers confuse with this one.  The red star Aldebaran, described above, is also the eye of the constellation Taurus, the Bull. The Hyades star cluster nearby forms the chin of the bull. If you become familiar with this constellation, you can find it as a starting point and look for the Pleiades nearby.Taurus may be difficult to see during a bright moon, especially near an urban area.	Look for the Pleiades in autumn and winter. Face the southern sky. Find Orion. Follow the line of the belt to Aldebaran. Move onward to find the Pleiades. Use Taurus as a guide next time.
In the southern hemisphere, the best time to harvest the seeds is February or March.; , Gently shake the branch, and the tiny, dust-like seeds will fall into the bag.  Tie a twisty tie around it, or simply make a knot to prevent the seeds blowing away.  Keep the seeds damp constantly until germination.  If you plant it earlier, the young shoots risk being eaten by local pests, such as possums.	Collect the seed in late summer. Hold a bag over a cluster of seed capsules. Carefully remove the bag from the cluster. Sow the seeds thinly in good potting soil in suitable seedling containers. Plant in the garden when the seedling has turned into a small sapling and is strong.
Remember, Sif is the only female in her group, so she is always willing to prove that she is as good as all the boys warriors around her. Meaning that you shouldn't be afraid to speak up your mind or take a challenge. You might as well earn more respect from other people like that. If you are too shy, then think to yourself: "Hey, my ideas are as good as others !" So don't be afraid and show people what you've got ! As an Asgardian, Sif is tough, confident and proud, don't let people push you around !; , Sif is an Asgardian, meaning she has supernatural strength and fighting skills. She is shown to excel at hand-to-hand combat and likes to use cold weapons (such as swords). So you could pick taekwondo  classes or karate classes. If you prefer weapons, kendo or fencing would do the trick. If you don't like combat sports, anything that increases your strength or agility is fine! Don't forget to exercise regularly. On the top of that, it'll keep you in good health !  , Sif doesn't like to follow orders if she thinks they're wrong. Again, this matches step 1. For example, if someone tells you to do something that you feel bad about, argue a little. Listen to the person's opinion and don't always argue though ! What I'm saying is that you shouldn't be afraid to show the person that you're against the idea.  One of the biggest problems in school is that there are a lot of clans, especially with girls. For example, students tend to judge you on how you look, and not on who you are. Sif wouldn't care about that. She hangs out with boys and likes fighting more than talking makeup and clothes. It doesn't mean that you shouldn't befriend girls ! It means that you should wear clothes you feel comfortable in and don't pretend that you like fashion if you don't. But on special occasions, wear dresses and more feminine outfit, so that boys don't think of you as a complete tomboy, but as a cool and fun girl !  , Sif is the first person to suspect Loki of treason, showing that she is very observant. Look beneath the looks and see if someone is trustworthy or not. You might even have a new (better) vision of your surroundings. Don't just burst out your crush's name or any secret ! It's your private life. Also, don't tell people that you're trying to act like Sif, they'll look down on you for that.	Stand up for yourself. Pick up a sport. Be independent. Hang out with people you like. Be aware.
The longer you wait, the more likely it is that the paint will dry. When the paint dries, it will become considerably more difficult to remove.  Take something like a palette knife and use it to gently lift excess paint from the leather. Begin by working around the outside of the stain to avoid spreading the paint. Keep the tool level, so that you limit contact with the couch and do not scratch the leather.   Leather does not handle moisture well, so you should try to remove as much of the stain as possible without recourse to water.Alternatively, you could try using a credit card or a razor blade.  Find a towel that is good at absorbing moisture. Pat the remainder of the stain, lifting as much of it as possible. If you can, try using a dry towel to avoid damaging the leather. If a dry towel does not seem to work, apply a little bit of water and a nonabrasive soap, like hand soap. After cleaning up the stain, use a towel to pat the surface and remove water as quickly as possible.	Act as quickly as possible. Use a flat tool to remove the paint. Wipe with kitchen towel.
Don't lecture...start a dialogue. Critical thinking helps children develop skepticism when it comes to violence. Here's some questions you might ask:   That's interesting. If someone chased me with a frying pan, I'd call the police. What would you do? These people seem to solve their problems with martial arts. Is that something you see at school? Do you think falling off a cliff would hurt you? Why doesn't it for the Coyote?  , Understanding how media is not reality helps children realize it's make-believe.  Make a flip-book. Cartoons are based on this technological effect, not little people in a TV. It is also an excellent art and science project! Visit a TV studio. Many communities have a local TV studio, such as a community cable studio, high school or college TV station. Seeing the equipment, people, and techniques that go into making a TV show helps build understanding.  It is very easy to use aggression as a way of getting what you want but that it is something every person, including yourself, has to learn to overcome. It is very, very rare that one has to resort to physical violence to solve a situation.  Verbal violence is also not acceptable, including bullying language or concepts. This also means put-downs, name-calling, threats and so on. While more subtle, these are surprisingly common in cartoons.	Watch TV with your kids, and discuss physical violence that your child has seen in cartoons, TV shows or movies. Learn about TV and "Movie Magic". Talk about how to deal with situations appropriately.
One of Dr. House’s most defining characteristics is his sarcastic sense of humor. Instead of telling side-splitting jokes, be humorous in a way that is understated and subtle. Respond to situations that you are in with ironic comments and intelligent quips.For instance, at one point when another character is trying to have a serious conversation with Dr. House about his emotions, Dr. House says, "Did you come for my feelings? Because I left 'em in my other pants."Dr. House often verges on rudeness when he makes sarcastic comments about other people. This is something you may want to avoid in your own life, as he often rubs people the wrong way.; , Dr. House is a long way from an optimist. He sees the dark in the world as well as the light. Though being a realist is a difficult thing to teach yourself, try not to be naïve about other people and the world at large.One quote that illustrates Dr. House's life philosophy is: "Welcome to the world. Everyone's different, everyone gets treated different. You try fighting that, you end up dying of TB."Learn more about psychology to understand the underlining motivations behind people and society in general. If you ever start feeling too pessimistic, stop and remember that there are other aspects of Dr. House’s personality that you channel.  Dr. House isn’t afraid of other people noticing him or thinking that he’s strange. He often does odd and outlandish things, not caring how others see him and sometimes even relishing their confusion. If you ever get the urge to do or say something eccentric, don’t hold yourself back!For instance, if you are standing in a very long line at the DMV, you could say loudly, “Do you think Santa will let me sit on his lap?” Smile exaggeratedly at anyone who looks around at you.  No matter what situation you’re in, be confident and outspoken. Dr. House is tremendously confident in himself, even though he does acknowledge his flaws. He is assured of his intelligence and the fact that he often is the most learned person in the room.Try to be quietly confident as opposed to being openly boastful. Bragging about your skills and intelligence or acting like certain situations are below you can alienate others.  As prickly as Dr. House can sometimes be, he does genuinely want his patients to get better. In your daily life, even if you are sarcastic with those around you, try your best to help others, even if your help is behind the scenes rather than out in the open.	Be sarcastic. Look at life realistically. Be eccentric. Act confident. Hide your compassion behind a gruff exterior.
For each cutting you plan to make, select a small branch attached to the outside base of the lavender plant. A young, bendable branch is required, or a branch growing horizontal just above the soil surface.   There are several related methods of propagation referred to as "layering." This one is simple and low-risk, but can be labor-intensive if you plan to create more than a few cuttings. Refer to the tips below if you want to turn your lavender plant into dozens of new cuttings instead.  Dig a 4–6 inch (10–15 cm) hole in the soil, a short distance from the mother plant. Position this hole so you can bend the middle of the selected branch down into it, with the leaves and flowers at the end above ground on the other side of the hole.  Hold the branch in place with rocks or a bent stake to prevent it springing out of the hole. Bury the center of the branch in soil to fill the hole, leaving the flowering end above ground.  Water the buried section occasionally, keeping it moist but not soggy. Take care not to let the soil dry out during hot summer months.   Watering is not recommended while the plant is dormant for the winter. Mulch can help the soil retain water, but may cause plants to overheat during hot weather.  While you can begin this process any time, the branch may not develop a strong stem and roots until the growing season in spring and summer. After three or four months of growth, preferably as cool autumn weather begins, carefully dig around the buried branch to look for roots. If they are present and clumping the soil together, cut off the branch so all the roots are on the same piece as the flowering end.  Move the cutting directly to its new location, moving the surrounding soil along with it to avoid damaging the roots. Keep the plant sheltered from wind until stronger roots develop, and care for it as you would any lavender plant.	Choose a small, young branch near the base of the lavender. Bury the middle of the branch in a shallow hole. Anchor the branch in place. Keep the buried branch moist. Dig up and cut the branch after at least three months of growing season. Transplant the cutting as a new lavender plant.
Laughing can be contagious. Laugh louder and more often than you feel like you should. Whether it ends up being just you laughing or others join in, you may quickly find yourself laughing naturally and enjoying the movie just a little bit more.    Studies show that smiling - fake or not - can increase your sense of happiness.The movie may not improve but your overall state of enjoyment will!  ,   Try to identify the merits in the movie. If you hate the plot, try to look at it from an artistic sense and find some value in the design choices or costuming.    There are some movies out there that are just terrible. Instead of suffering through a bad movie, just accept its flaws and take it as it is. A lot of terrible productions end up being cult classics. - You may be experiencing one! In order to most effectively implement this option, here are some suggested readings:   Radical Acceptance by Tara Brach  The Dhammapada as uttered by The BuddhaWhen Things Fall Apart by Pema Chodron	Laugh More. Fake a smile. Tell yourself you like it. Accept it and enjoy.
This can be an existing shoe bag that you no longer want or you can purchase a new or used one. The only requirement is that it be a cloth one, as all-plastic ones will likely heat the flower roots too much and could kill them during warmer weather periods.  It will need to be at least as wide as the shoe bag.  Either place two hooks on the wall at the same space across as the shoe bag hanger holes are, or knock in two nails. Whatever you use, it must be solid and strong because once you add soil to the shoe bag, it'll be hanging heavily.  Adjust if necessary to ensure that it is sitting straight and taut.  Old grocery plastic bags or freezer bags are ideal.  Add any well-rotted manure or compost, or other fertilizer to help the flowers grow well.  Continue until the whole shoe bag is filled with flowers.  Water regularly but gently, so as to not over water the plants. Mulch to keep the soil moist. It can also help to add a saturating aid to the soil, to evenly distribute and retain the water.  Consider using other items you don't need anymore to make a flower wall, such as cloth bags, stitched up denim shorts or jeans, etc.	Repurpose a shoe bag into a flower wall. Find a suitable wall space for hanging the shoe bag from. Attach the cloth shoe bag to the wall or backing area. Put the shoe bag on the hooks or nails. Line each of the shoe holes with a plastic bag. Fill each plastic bag with soil suited to the flowers you'd like to grow. Plant the flower seeds or seedlings into the soil of each shoe bag hole. Moisten sufficiently with a spray bottle. Admire your easily made flower wall.
To make a home movie, you'll need some sort of video recording device. Digital camcorders offer the best video quality and options, but cell phones are more convenient and, if you already own a video phone, cheaper. You should also find a tripod for smooth still shots, unless you want the video to be shaky throughout (which is fine in some kinds of videos). There are tripods made for both smartphones and regular digital camcorders. A small digital microphone may be useful for interviews. If you want or need any lighting elements, now is the time to collect those, as well.   Phone tripods tend to be smaller and shorter than camcorder tripods. Find a raised flat surface (like a table) to make them “taller” if needed.       Your camcorder may also come with protective gear, including a cap over the lens to keep it from getting scratched. Be sure to remove the lens cap before filming!      ; , Are you recording a special event, an ordinary day, or something else? Do you want to interview people, have them act naturally, or use them as actors in a play? Think about these and similar questions, and come up with a rough plan to follow. Even something mundane like filming a child playing or a wedding reception can often benefit from a bit of advance planning.   If you're filming a play or scripted scene, you'll need a few more supplies, including costumes, props, and copies of your script. If you're interested in adding cool props without spending a lot of money, check out the YouTube show “Backyard FX” for plenty of interesting and easy-to-follow tutorials.  You'll need a powerful video editor such as Adobe After Effects to create special effects like muzzle flashes and laser beams. The program is pretty expensive, so be forewarned. Physical props, on the other hand, can usually be made cheaply.   If you're filming a family function like a reunion or wedding, make a general plan instead of just filming whatever is in front of you all day. Take key people (like the bride and groom) aside for interviews, or get some shots of the venue and then interview someone about its history. Your finished video can combine all these elements to make a very watchable reel that never gets boring. If you're just filming things as they happen (as with pets or children), plan to keep filming for a while, and then condense it down to the most interesting parts later. You run a higher chance of capturing something funny or charming this way.  Check the battery level of your recording device before you begin, and have a charger nearby just in case. Turn it on and off, and adjust all the settings to ensure they're working. Clear away any extra junk (like laundry on the floor) that doesn't need to be in your shots, and be sure the tripod is assembled and working properly. Shoot a little bit of test video and play it back to make sure the color and sound are okay. Check your microphone as well, if you're using one. Finally, prepare lighting: light candles, angle desk lights, or open windows until you get the quality of light you want.  Make sure that its not too on the edge of your seat or one small fall in climax (the action of it). This will make your audience get bored. Make sure all of the characters in it are distinct. Ease into your topic (For example, if the people are on a date and they get in an argument just sitting down and shouting "I hate you!" it won't work out) and make sure it flows., Make sure that the actors have talent. Don't draft them because they're cool or are your friend. If you want them to help, try an off camera job. Make sure to have an understudy in case someone gets sick., Make sure by at least the 5th page that the plot is established., See if some still don't work or it takes too long to film. It's alright to have the cast read off a script., Have it memorized with all your actors including the understudies., Get some shots of the place you'll be filming; these can come in very handy, depending on the type of video you're making, and they can serve as your test footage besides. Area shots can be interspersed to give videos a better sense of place. They can also serve as useful segues between scenes, or give you a chance to add a voice-over or credits sequence.  Shoot your area shots using the tripod, so that they're steady.  By varying wide, medium, and close-up shots, you can compose a finished video that's more attention-grabbing than the average continuous-shot home video.   Wide-angle, panoramic shots can be done from a tripod to establish place for scene changes in your story, or to give the viewer a sense of the size of an event such as a party or wedding. A wide-angle shot with an acute angle to a road is also perfect for car chases, if you're making that kind of video.       Medium shots are used to show action. Shoot from a moderate distance (or using a moderate zoom) to capture things like playing children, group dances, or people eating at a family reunion. The medium shot is also good for showing sword fights, stunt scenes, and sports plays.       Close-up shots are best used to show emotions and reactions. They're also useful for interviews or dialog between characters. Try to frame people to one side of your close shots rather than right in the center.  It's fine to film things according to what makes sense at the moment, and then edit your video so that everything flows on the finished product. If you're filming a family event and you want to interview people, for example, you can do short interviews before and after the event, and then cut them into footage of the event itself to create a running narrative. If you've got people in costumes with props, film all your scenes with those items first, and then switch to other pieces and film those scenes afterward. It's easy to reorder parts of your video later, thanks to modern video editing software.  Once you've got all the footage you're going to get, put it all on your computer so that you can cut out the extra parts, reorder it, and put finishing touches on it. High-quality video takes up a lot of space, so consider using an external hard drive for longer videos.   To get video from your camcorder, either hook the camcorder up to your computer with a cable made especially for that purpose (most new camcorders will come with one already), or record it to optical media (if your camcorder has a built-in DVR) and then transfer the video from your discs to the computer. To get video from your smartphone, either e-mail it to yourself and then download it from your computer, or hook up the phone to the computer with a cable and transfer the files directly, as you would with a digital camcorder. Note that the e-mail method is prohibitively slow for longer videos.  To start with, open your raw video file in either Windows Media Maker (Windows users) or iMovie (Mac users). There are other free programs available as well, but these are the two that most computer users are likely to already have installed, and they're both roughly equal in terms of power and usefulness. Go through the timeline of your video and highlight, then delete any segments you know you won't need.   It's best to be rough and approximate at this stage. Only cut out things you're sure you won't use, and don't cut them off too closely to things you probably will use. You can clean up the odds and ends of your clips later.  Still using rough cuts, separate each “part” of the video into its own chunk, and move them around on the timeline. Use the video preview function on your program to get a sense of how scenes will flow from one to the next.   Spend as much time as you want at this stage. Try everything that crosses your mind, until each of your segments flows smoothly from one to the next (rough video cuts notwithstanding). You may find that some footage isn't as useful as you thought it'd be; it's fine to delete such footage. Follow a sensible narrative first, and worry about varying shots second. Sometimes you might find that you end up with a lot of one type of shot (wide, medium, or close) in a row. That's fine as long as the video's narrative makes sense that way.  Zoom into your timeline so that you can edit at very small time intervals, and clip out excess footage on the ends of your segments. Check your work with the preview tool to be sure you've gotten all the excess footage.   You can add simple video transitions between scenes by overlaying them on the timeline, if you want. These include things like horizontal and vertical screen wipes, fade-outs, and text titling. Play around with your program's transition effects library to find some you like, or skip them for a more organic-looking video.  If you've got some skill, a copy of After Effects (or a similar program), and footage that needs Foley sounds or virtual explosions and gunfire, now is the time to add those elements. You'll have to export the video file and open it in your effects program. Once you're finished adding effects, save the video and open it back up in your basic movie editor again.   This guide doesn't cover any specifics of how to create effects in After Effects or similar programs, but there are a couple of guides elsewhere on wikiHow, including one on how to animate a lightsaber. Once you've exported your video, it'll open in your movie editor as one continuous file again. If you want to break it back into sections after this point, you'll have to do so manually.  If you'd like to add music, you can do so by importing music files and dragging them into your timeline's audio track. You can choose to mute the original video track (useful for scene shots), or leave it on and use the music to add emotion to an interview or speech. Finally, add a title card to the beginning of your movie - or title it on top of the opening footage for a more active effect – and add credits, if necessary, to the end.   Once you're done with your video, watch it with the preview tool one more time, and then export it to create a finished video. If you save it rather than exporting it, it'll remain a video project file rather than an actual video.  Now that you've got a finished video, share it with people. If you're recording a video to distribute to friends or family, use a DVR drive to burn copies of it to DVD discs and mail them to your recipients. To share it with the world at large, you can upload your video to YouTube, Vimeo, or a similar site.   If you're uploading a video, avoid using copyrighted music. Sometimes, record companies get upset about unlicensed use of copyrighted songs and will complain to get your video taken down. You probably won't get into any actual trouble, but it's still frustrating. You can make your YouTube videos semi-private by only allowing people who have the URL (web address) to access the video, but there's always a chance someone unintended will stumble across it by accident, so keep your content above board.	Get equipment. Come up with an idea. Set up ahead of time. Write a script. Draft actors and helpers. Revise your script and cut out the boring scenes. Dry film (don't use a camera) the scenes. Revise the script again, and then work on the memorization. Start with area shots. Use three shots to make a professional-looking video. Record scenes out of order. Transfer video to your computer. Cut out excess footage. Reorder your video. Finish the cuts. Add effects, if necessary. Add the finishing touches. Share your video.
The much-prized 1927-D $20 is one of the rarest collector coins because most were destroyed before they were released into circulation. Uncirculated coins are particularly valuable. But how can you determine an uncirculated coin just by looking at it?   One way to tell is by asking: would you expect an uncirculated, 100 year-old coin to be dull with tiny scratches, or bright and shiny? If your answer is "dull with tiny scratches", then congratulations - you're a natural! In its original condition, an old coin tends to be dull and hazy and may have a few tiny scratches. If the coin is bright, shiny and has no scratches then this probably indicates that the coin has been buffed or cleaned. Remember: a shiny coin attracts buyers looking for the wrong thing. Eye-appeal is important, but old coins should be purchased in their original condition, and not cleaned-up.; , Almost all old coins carry collectible premiums. However, there are many coins being wrongly promoted as collectible, which a dealer won't necessarily pay you a premium for.  Confusingly, in some instances, coins have been reproduced by a country using an old design cast.   For instance, Swiss and French franc were produced in the 1940s using an old die cast, and bearing an older date. In Austria, Ducats bearing the date 1915 are currently being reproduced. And, of course, mistaken or dishonest dealers are offering them as rare old coins for a premium. And so the problem emerges: no-one knows the true population of the coins made with that date, nor how to tell the old from the new. So what can you do? The answer is: keep your ear to the ground and pay attention to industry news. In today's internet and information-saturated age, once a coin is found to be illegitimate the world and his wife will quickly know about it.  A rare coin doesn't necessarily have to be "rare" by population, but it should be scarce. So, although many US coins were made in big populations, what really makes a coin scarce is the condition it has survived in.   The reported mintage figure for the 1927-D $20 gold piece was about 180,000 pieces - fairly high. Yet it ranks as one of the all-time rarities in the series because most of the 1927-Ds were destroyed before they were released into circulation. On the other hand, the 1913-D $20 had yet small mintage of 34,000 pieces. But there is little or no premium attached to these coins because almost the entire mintage survived. Although, if a coin is in great original condition and has also originated from a small population, then you are looking at a seriously collectible buy.  During the Y2K crisis, many dealers promoted cheap double eagle coins as great future investments, then priced just $80 or $100 above their gold value. Collectors bought them as bargain investments preferable to pricier uncirculated double eagles. These buyers were duped: after Y2K, it was discovered that many of the coins were worth little more than their melt value. So, if you are looking for less-expensive buy, keep an eye out for old and uncirculated coins with sizes and premiums similar to modern fractional bullion coins. This will help you spot good, appreciating coins.  All too often, coin dealers will shirk the responsibility for the accuracy of coin gradings - that is, to value the coin by analyzing its surface preservation, strike, luster and eye-appeal (see below). Typically, they will refer to the current grading service standards. This can pose a problem, and can work against market trends. Coin grading standards can change or loosen-up in order to introduce more coins to the market. The opposite scenario is that there may be no demand for the coin.   Keep an eye out for dealers that respond to changing market trends - particularly ones who will guarantee to buy-back the coins at the same grade they sold them to you.  The question particularly applies to US coins. In 1934, the US stopped minting coins as legal tender as ordered by President Franklin D Roosevelt, to take currency out of the hands of the public during the depression.   Numismatic experts agree that only 2% of US coins minted prior to 1934 are available on the coin market today. Ninety-five percent of these coins were melted down by the US after being confiscated form the public, with others destroyed in private industry meltdowns, or simply lost. As a collector, you can be sure of the rarity of your purchase thanks to regular figures published by the Professional Coin Grading Service (PCGS) and Numismatic Guarantee Corporation (NGC).  In the United States alone, there are currently around 5,000 coin dealers. Only a handful of them are reputable and established with the ability to give you the best service and advice.   Research your dealer thoroughly before you do business with them, through their history, and other collector's feedback. In the UK, Companies House (companies-house.gov.uk/info) offers free information on organizations date of incorporation, registered address, whether their accounts and returns are up-to-date and it has a list of disqualified directors. The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) has a section of its website dedicated to warning about scams (dti.gov.uk/ccp/scams/page1.htm).  Here are the four factors taken into account when grading a coin:   Surface preservation: analysts look for bag marks, hairlines from cleaning or mishandling and other perfections (mint caused or man-made), their severity and their location on the coin's surface. Strike: or the sharpness and completeness of detail in the coin's design. The normal characteristics of the coin's age, type and mint mark (or issue) are taken into account. Luster: or the brilliance, cartwheel, sheen and contrast of the coin. Again, each issue's characteristics are considered. Evidence of cleaning, retoning or friction is also examined. Eye-appeal: that is, the aesthetic appeal that results from the attractiveness of the coin's toning, the balance of the coin and the combination of all the coin's qualities. Generally, surface preservation is considered the most important of the above four grading factors, with the other three equal in value and about half as important as surface grading.  For US coins, the industry uses a 70-point numerical grading scale to define the condition (or grade) of a rare coin. Mint State (MS) coins were struck for general circulation. Proof (PR) coins were specifically struck for coin collectors. Coins graded MS63 or PR63, or higher, are usually recommended for purchase because they a) have shown the best rates of appreciation, and b) are more attractive.	Is the coin uncirculated, and how can you tell?, Will a dealer pay you premium for the coin in the future?, Has the coin ever been re-struck?, Does the coin have a low mintage (meaning not many were made)?, Is the coin over-valued or under-valued?, Is the coin over-graded?, Was the coin minted prior to 1934?, Is the dealer reputable or well capitalized?, How do you grade a coin?, How does the industry define a rare coin's condition?
Although not always considered a forklift, pallet jacks are some of the most common manual forms of pallet handling that people will come across in logistics industries.  Manual pallet jacks are usually very simple in design; the handle lever is squeezed to lower the pallet jack forks for insertion into a pallet, and the handle lever is moved in the opposite direction to engage the hydraulics that allows the pallet to be raised.; , Motorized pallet jacks, on the other hand, are much more varied than manual pallet jacks. They are almost always powered by electric batteries.   Some are walk-behind, some are ride-on, and some even require the operator to take a side stance to ride on/operate, which is considerably more difficult to learn. Motorized pallet jacks usually have extended pallet forks that are used to handle two pallets at a time for greater efficiency in large warehouse operations, such as order picking. However, single pallet handlers are more common in smaller warehouses, for greater maneuverability and ease of use.  Walkie stackers, also known as pedestrian forklifts, are not usually considered a forklift. However, they still closely resemble a forklift with forks, a mast, backrest, etc. They are almost always operated with a walk-behind pedestrian operator. They are frequently used in retail, very small storerooms/mini warehouses, small scale warehousing, etc.	Know what manual pallet jacks are. Familiarize yourself with motorized pallet jacks. Learn to recognize walkie stackers.
You want new material available regularly, so that the training materials don't become stale. Also, look for a site that has graduated exercises so that you don't become bored once a level becomes too easy for you. Yes, as hard as it might seem at first, it's a skill that you can learn! There are many just a Google search away.; , There are number of books specifically designed to teach sight reading, and take you through practice exercises methodically—each exercise building on the previous exercise, and adding a little something new each time. Here are couple highly-recommended titles:    Improve your Sight-Reading! Piano, Level 1 from Alfred Music Publishing. There are a total of eight volumes, which take you from beginner to advanced.  Primer Level Sightreading Book from Hal Leonard Publishing. For more advanced readers, there are two additional volumes.  The biggest key to successful sight reading is that you only read and play the music once. You can buy a number of music books, borrow them from the library, or print out piano music from a website. Those will all work, but may result in a haphazard learning process.   Think of it like this: when you learned to read, you started with "See Spot run. Run, Spot, run!" You didn't immediately jump to "O joy, O new vertigo of difference, O my platonic reader-writer racked by a most platonic insomnia..."For the best results, focus on music within your skill range.	Train online with sites that are refreshed often. Purchase a "Method" book. Keep it fresh.
It's better to listen to a piano version, but other instruments will also help. Your mind will pick up the melody and rhythm, and then knowing the tune makes it easier to know whether you are producing the intended sound for what you read.; , It is very important to realise whether you can't -- by either technical skill or physical technique -- play the song; so, you don't start and have to quit because of things you don't know.  It is very annoying to practice the song with a metronome, and one might not help. But, maybe it is syncopated (a kind of off-beat rhythm), varied from a standard rhythmic accent:Throw a pair of tennis shoes or jeans in the clothes dryer. Chances are the rhythm you hear will be syncopated, like an ad-lib, varied from standard, but in a general pattern, such as jazz.  This follows the level of how good you are at reading notes.   Read and play only one hand at a time.  Practice the treble and the base clef separately.   Read and put both hands together when you can. Read both hands and characterise the tune of the song properly working up to the desired speed.  Learning to read notes takes many hours practice, but saves you from fumbling later. As a student you can read loads of notes, not only music supplied by the teacher, but also found other places by yourself.	Learn the tune before you attempt to read and play the song. Prepare by scanning and visualising the notes first to find parts you might get in trouble with reading while playing. Make sure to stay in tempo!, Try these steps to reading notes. Remember, these skill won't come by themselves. Study up, ask and read about different methods of scoring music to know whether it's for vocal or instrumental, duet, trio, 4 part harmony, or "easy piano", or is sheet music with a lead-sheet with a melody line and numbered chords for a studio musician, or geared for a jazz ensemble.
This would help you decide upon how many beds that you would need. This is the first thing to consider and must be right the first time. This will help you to narrow your choices.; , Why? There is more storage space and there is less hassle of assembling and reassembling dining and kitchen areas; you have the area dedicated to these purposes. For example, if two people are traveling in a four berth motor home, you can have your sleeping quarters and dining area permanently made up and you won't have to break it down when needed. Plus, you get extra storage area. This is especially important the longer you rent the vehicle.  Possibilities include toilet, heating, shower, kitchen, storage, batteries or power and gas heating. Check to see if these facilities require outside power sources or if they are self contained within the vehicle. E.g, some vehicles require additional power to operate additional appliances, or you may want to save your generator/battery by using an outside power source.  Understand that fresh water and waste water tanks can mean frequent refilling and emptying of cassettes and tanks. Waste should generally should be emptied 2 to 3 days or this can cause some unwanted odors to linger in your motor home.  Consider the width restrictions on the area you would be visiting to make sure that it would not be too wide on the roads you will be driving on. Consider the flexibility and the maneuverability and dimensions, especially with high tops.  Prior research of parks and roads is essential, especially when traveling with a larger motor home.  You might decide to rent an older vehicle rather than a brand new one. Prices are also determined by the amenities you choose. One warning, you do get what you pay for, what may seem to be a bargain at first could turn into a nightmare when you rent the vehicle. If going for a budge vehicle, ensure that the vehicle is well maintain and the company offers 24 hour roadside assistance., You pay for spontaneity. Check what the off season rates are and book then - these will vary per country. Booking prior to holidays (e.g school holidays, public holidays like the 4th of July) can save you money., Each company has unique policies that vary for various circumstances. Questions to ask when reviewing the terms: What happens if I get into an accident? What happens if the vehicle breaks down? What happens if return the vehicle earlier or later? What happens if my vehicle gets broken into?	Figure out just how many people will be traveling with you. Always consider the next berth up when renting a motor home. Decide on just how many facilities you would need and how self sufficient you would expect to be. Think about how long a trip you will be taking and how long you will be actually traveling as opposed to how much time you might be spending at a campsite. Understand that some areas and roads have restrictions when it comes to sizes and widths. Check camping ground and holiday parks to see if they can facilitate the size of your vehicle beforehand. Make sure you rent accordingly to your budget. Booking well in advance often ensures a lower rate. An absolute must: Check the terms and conditions thoroughly.
Frangipanis prefer to be in the ground but also do well in terra cotta containers. They go dormant in winter, but cannot withstand frost. If you live in a place with harsh winters (temperatures below freezing), a container is best so the plant can be moved inside or stored during winter.   Early spring is the best time to plant a frangipanis so it is established and blooming heavily by summer. Plunging, or burying a potted plumeria in the ground, can be done in cooler climates. This way you can keep your plant in the ground, yet still be able to easily move it inside during winter.; , Choose a spot where it will get at least 6 hours of sun daily. You may also want to plant it somewhere you will be able to enjoy the lovely scent its flowers produce. Great locations include placing them near patios and windows, or beside driveways and walkways.   If you have a patio or deck with outdoor seating, plant your frangipanis nearby so you can see and smell the beautiful blooms all summer. Or, if using a container, find a sunny spot on the deck to keep it.Their shallow roots make them well suited for planting along pathways and other hardscapes, like pools and water features., Your hole should be as deep as the root ball and three times as wide. It may help to loosen the soil first by digging in with the tip of your shovel several times, wiggling your shovel around each time to break up the dirt. Containers should be at least 40 cm (15¾ inches) in diameter.   Terra cotta pots absorb heat, helping simulate a tropical environment for the roots, and provide good drainage since they are porous. They are also usually top heavy, which will help support the plant as it grows. You can use a plastic pot if you prefer or want a cheaper, decorative option, as long as you If you take special care to use a good quality, well-draining soil.  When planting, you may find the soil has poor drainage, like clay or silt, when you dig into it. You will need to mix this with compost or commercial soil made for dry-loving plants before planting.Containers should be filled with premium potting mix with no added wetting agents.   Cactus mix is a good option, or you can mix regular potting soil with pearlite or orchid bark.Place large rocks or broken pot fragments in the bottom of containers before adding any soil, so holes don't become clogged. The best kinds of water soluble fertilizers you can use will have a phosphorus content 50, fertilizers can get as low as 20, but higher content is OK as well., Use your hands to loosen the soil at the very bottom of the root ball and gently spread the roots out. Failing to separate the roots makes your plant susceptible to root rot.   If the plant is already root bound, meaning the roots have grown around and filled the pot, you need to use a planting knife to cut them apart before planting.When using a root knife, make three vertical incisions near the bottom of the root ball, a few inches deep with each cut running through the bottom. To separate the root ball, use your hands to pull apart the roots from each other so they grow in different directions.  If your pot or hole is deeper than the root ball, add some soil first. When planting in a container, you should only have a few inches separating the top of the root ball and the top of the container. Cover the root ball halfway with soil, water thoroughly, and allow it to drain. Fill rest of container or hole with soil and pack it down to support the trunk.   Watering the soil at mid-point will help it to settle and eliminate air pockets around the roots.Be sure not to cover any of the exposed trunk with added soil. You only want the tree to be planted as deep as it was in its original container.  For containers, the plant will have enough water when you see excess start to come out the bottom holes. Trees planted outdoors should be well watered after planting, but moderately throughout the spring and summer months, especially while the tree is young.A good technique for potted watering is to water until it pools, wait 30 seconds for it to drain, and continue this until you see drainage.  Mulch and moss help retain moisture in ground soil longer in hot, dry climates. Whichever you choose to use, make sure it doesn’t touch the trunk or the plant could develop fungal decay from too much moisture.For plants growing in containers, you could dress the container with Spanish moss. Be sure to keep it lose around the trunk.  You should bring your frangipanis inside when temperatures starts getting toward 40°F (4.4°C) or so. Store it in a dry, ventilated area that stays above freezing. Remove all leaves from the plant before storing.Return your plumeria to the outdoors after winter storage when the temperature most nights reaches 50° or above. Place the container in a sunny spot or plant it wherever you want and water thoroughly. , Frangipani can withstand drought conditions and do not like staying wet. Overwatering can cause root rot. If planted in the ground, they need only an inch of water per week. Container plants generally need more regular watering. Do not water at all during winter months when plant is dormant.   Begin watering your frangipanis for the season at the first sign of leaf growth.Stop watering when leaves begin to drop in the fall. This means the plant is starting to go dormant for the season.Keep a rain gauge in your garden to measure weekly rain and/or the amount of water accumulated from sprinklers. Water containers until water comes out the drainage holes, then wait to water again when the first few centimeters of the soil becomes dry. Check the drainage holes of potted plants periodically and make sure they have not become clogged., Start with the first feeding in early spring when the frangipanis comes out of dormancy and leaves are at least 2 inches long. Always use a fertilizer with high phosphorus content.In most cases, this will involve sprinkling one tablespoon per five gallon pot onto soil and watering.In early spring, use a 15-15-15 mix. (Phosphorus is the second number displayed.) In April, switch fertilizers to a 6-20-20 blend with micronutrients. Use 0-40-0 when buds start forming. For the last feeding of the season in early fall, use 6-20-20. Frangipanis stop growing when the average temperature is consistently below 65°F (18.3°C). In Southern areas, they may bloom through November, but watch the nighttime temperatures in your location carefully to know when to stop feeding it., For plumeria planted outside, use a frost cloth to cover the whole tree if nighttime temperatures are going to drop below 33°. Use a cloth big enough to come to the ground on all sides. Remove the cloth during day when its sunny or if it will rain. Rain could weigh the cloth down and break limbs.If your plant gets frost damage, the ends of branches will turn brown and the tips may turn black. Cut off any black parts and check brown sections for firmness. Any soft spots should be cut off, also. Treat the cut ends with a fungicide to prevent further damage to the wounded part of the plant.  Rust is a fungus that looks like rust on metal. If you see signs of rust, remove all heavily affected leaves. Spray the rest of the tree with a mix of one heaping tablespoon of baking soda, one tablespoon of Neem oil, a few drops of dish soap mixed with a gallon of water. Use a tank sprayer, and spray once a week until no signs of rust are visible.Do not spray in the middle of the day in summer or you might burn the leaves. Spray in the morning or evening when the plant isn’t getting direct sunlight.  Trimming branches helps shape your plumeria and encourages growth the following year. The beginning of winter is a good time to prune your tree, just before storing for the season. Established, mature trees only need pruning to keep them at their preferred size, or if they have damaged or diseased limbs.Plumeria are considered young for 3 or 4 years. After this, they only need to be pruned when they outgrow their space or require shaping. Never remove more than 10% of the branches to avoid stressing your frangipanis and inhibiting new growth. Blooms only grow at the end of branches and take two years to form on cut branches. Consider pruning only half of the tree one winter, and the other half the following year to maintain seasonal flowering., Frangipanis should not be exposed to direct sunlight during pruning or in the few days following it. If your plumeria is planted in the ground, wait until the sun is less intense and no extreme weather is expected for a few days., Doing this the first few years will encourage trees to produce more branches and become fuller. Use hand pruners and cut the stem at an angle. After cutting, the trimmings can be put in a vase, composted, or thrown away.   Always wear work gloves and safety glasses when cutting. Branches ooze a milky sap when cut that can irritate skin.  Frangipanis tend to produce more than one main stem, which will change the shape of your tree by making it more bushy. Trim down any stems competing with the main trunk, or cut them off close to the beginning of the branch.Shortening branches encourages new shoots to grow out of the branch, making your tree fuller. If you want a branch to grow new shoots, do not cut it closer than 6 inches to the main trunk.Exactly where you trim your frangipanis and how much depends on your vision for the tree. Air on the side of caution to avoid over-pruning. You can always make a second round of cuts.  This will open up the remaining branches to sunlight, prevent the spread of disease, and allow the tree to become stronger. Cut close to the main stem at an angle.You may also cut any branches that grow in odd directions to create the shape you desire.   You may also remove lower limbs to create a canopy shape and keep the branches off the ground. Any limbs that look diseased, have been damaged by frost or exposure, or are infested with beetles should be cut and disposed of as soon as possible. Trim away any noticeable damage, infestations, or sickness as soon as you notice. Waiting may cause any of these to spread.	Decide between planting in the ground and in a large container. Plant or place your plumeria in a sunny place. Dig a hole or purchase a large terra cotta container for your plant. Mix in fresh soil and high phosphorus fertilizer. Loosen the root ball. Plant the root ball. Water your tree thoroughly. Add mulch or moss. Store your plumeria during winter. Water moderately. Fertilize twice a month in spring and summer. Prevent frost damage in winter. Watch for rust on leaves. Prune young trees yearly. Move your tree into a shady area for pruning. Cut no more than three inches (7.6 cm) off main stems. Remove or cut down subordinate stems. Remove crowded, damaged, and infected limbs.
Try wiggling the brake pad, calipers, and other brake components. They should not move with just your hands.Loose parts can vibrate, resulting in noise.; ,, Disc Brake Quiet is one brand. Apply a thin layer of the substance to the back of the brake pads (between the pad and the caliper assembly). This will create a thin cushion to dampen the vibration and thereby the sound. Give the paste plenty of time to dry before you assemble the brakes to make sure it hardens: two to three hours at least, overnight if you can. It will become sticky and change to a darker color when it is dry.   Heat from the sun or a hair dryer helps to dry the paste, but let it cool to room temperature before installing the pads. Should you need to clean or remove the dampening paste, use a degreaser or brake cleaner.  Many disc brakes include a wear indicator designed to make noise if the pad is worn past a certain point.With aftermarket pads, sometimes the sizes can vary and cause the top of the pad to sit just slightly higher than the rotor. This will result in the brake pad wearing unevenly, leaving a lip or kind of a shelf of brake pad that rides over the tip of the rotor. This causes the brake pad to ride the edge of the rotor, causing a rotational brake noise. If your brake pads still have plenty of life left in them, you can sand the lip of the pad down (make sure you wear a mask to protect your lungs) to get more life out of the existing pads and eliminate the noise.  Try different materials, but remember that noise and effectiveness may be a trade-off. It is best to replace brake pads with a similar material. Check the service manual for your vehicle to see what the manufacturer recommends.   An organic pad (with or without asbestos) may be quieter, but may lack the performance and wear resistance of a semi-metallic or metallic pad. An organic pad may not tolerate heat as well, and may therefore be subject to more brake fade (reduction in braking effectiveness due to heat) than other pad materials. A semi-metallic pad, which has metal particles and organic material, tends to have the best of both worlds in braking ability without too much noise. It increases the pad life and decreases brake fade over organics, but it may wear the rotors slightly more. It will also tolerate repeated, hard stopping better without wearing as much as the organic pad. A "metallic pad" is just that. Different metals are used to provide the most friction against the rotor. It does a great job at stopping at repeated high speeds with minimum wear, but it will tend to make the most noise out of all the pads. Metallic pads will also cause the rotor to wear faster (grooves, ridges etc.), especially with stock rotors not designed for use with metal pads. Look for lubricating materials built into brake pads. Brass, graphite, carbon, and other materials in the formula can help reduce noise.Because these materials are built into the brake pad itself, they will continue to lubricate rather than wearing off upon use.  An irregular brake rotor or drum surface can cause the brake pad to jump and chatter in the brake assembly and caliper.   Check the surface smoothness visually against a comparator gauge or try writing on it with a ball point pen. If you don't get a smooth line, the rotor is either too greasy or too rough., If the rotor wear is not too deep, you may be able to have the rotors ground on a lathe to smooth the surface. Call around to find an auto shop that services brakes and has a rotor lathe. If you do find a shop, ask if they use round lathe bits to refinish as they produce smoother finishes. Additionally you should put a cross-hatch pattern on the newly cut surface using a rotor hone tool, it's similar to what your do with cylinders bores in an engine block.  If the wear is excessive or if the entire rotor is warped or distorted, you may have to replace the rotors altogether. Brake systems may be carefully designed and "tuned" by the manufacturer to avoid noise, so it is best to choose as close a replacement as possible.You may also need new rotors if the sound is not a squeal, but a metallic grind. If the brake pads are too worn, the rotors may be damaged.	Check for loose parts. Replace any shims or clips that are loose, damaged or missing to ensure that the pad does not move in the caliper assembly.  , Try a dampening paste. Check the brake pads, and replace them if they are worn. Try different brake pad materials. Check the brake rotor or drum for scoring, grooving, or other wear. Resurface the rotors. Replace the rotors or drums.
After the third year, it is no longer necessary to create new scaffold whorls. Outward-growing branches bear more fruit than upright branches. To get the maximum amount of fruit out of your tree, you might consider tying a string to the branches in the scaffold whorl and staking them in the ground during the growing season. Doing this will force the branches in the whorl to grow outward instead of vertically.Loppers and pruning saws are suitable pruning tools for trees that are too thick to handle with pruning shears. Be sure your tools are sharp and clean before you use them.  No matter how old the tree is, always try to prune during the winter, while it's still dormant. Trim away any dead or dried branches, dead leaves, and dead fruit. Throw them in the compost heap or garbage.Always remember to sterilize your pruning shears before using them, even if you're just cutting away a few dead branches.  If you see shoots growing at the base of the cherry tree, cut them. Pull out seedlings as well, so that the cherry tree's roots don't have to compete with a new tree., Each season, step back and look at your cherry tree is growing properly. Prune new branches that aren't part of the scaffold whorls, as well as branches that cross over one another. Remember that the goal is to create an open shape so that sunlight and air can reach the middle of the tree to help it bear fruit.If you see crossed branches, choose one to remove. Branches that don't produce fruit can be cut back flush with the leader.  Cherry trees are quite prone to disease, so it's best to remove all the trimmings after you're finished pruning, especially if you pruned away dead branches. Pick the dead matter off the ground and make sure to dispose of them far away from the tree to prevent disease., You might come upon a diseased or dying branch during the spring or summer, the least ideal time to prune a cherry tree. If this happens, prune away the branch, even though the tree is not dormant. The disease might spread to other parts of the tree if you don't remove it right away.If you're working with a diseased tree, you should clean the pruning tools you're using between every cut. Dip them in a bleach solution, wash them with hot water, and dry them off before proceeding.	Trim new vertical branches. Trim dead matter while the tree is dormant. Cut back new shoots and seedlings. Prune any excess branches. Clean up all cut branches and trimmings. Do an emergency pruning if necessary.
Move in light back-and-forth motions over the areas where dust commonly accumulates. Weekly dustings will remove a little dust and keep your flowers cleaner between deep cleanings.As an alternative to a feather duster, you could use:   A microfiber cloth. A hair dryer set to a low heat. A vacuum cleaner with an old stocking secured over the hose by a rubber band. If possible, set the vacuum cleaner to its lowest setting.; , Mist the flowers lightly. No wiping is required. You can buy the spray at major department stores like Target.   Cleaning sprays can be quite effective, but they are generally very expensive.  Place the flowers in a plastic resealable bag along with a few spoonfuls of coarse salt. Shake the bag gently for one minute. The grains of salt will act as mild abrasives, gently loosening dust and grime. When you're done, remove the flowers from the bag and shake off the remaining salt.   As an alternative to salt, you could use two to three tablespoons of cornmeal. Follow the same directions for the salt method., If you think your flowers can safely withstand a little moisture, fill a spray bottle with equal parts water and distilled vinegar. Mist the flowers very lightly with the mixture and allow them to air dry. You may want to place a towel under the flowers to absorb any drips.  Fill your sink with room temperature water and add a few drops of dish soap. Gently swish each flower around in the water, rubbing lightly to remove any stubborn grime. Immediately take the flower out of the water and blot the entire piece dry with a clean towel.   Use caution when drying the flowers, as the towel can loosen individual parts of each flower. Don’t soak your flowers if they’re hand wrapped. Soaking erodes the glue and weakens the floral tape.	Dust your flowers weekly. Use a silk flower cleaning spray. Shake the flowers in a bag of salt. Spray a mixture of vinegar and water. Use soap and water.
You should cut a section of 3/4" x 11 gauge tubing and weld it to your steering tabs. Insert an additional 1" spacer loosely by the shaft near the steering hoop, grinding the shaft slightly near the hoop if too tight.Drill a three hole pattern with the holes equidistant from the center of the washer at the end of your shaft.  Make your cuts at a 39 degree angle for your hoop. At this time you should verify that all measurements for your steering assembly are correct for your kart and allow for a full range of motion.   The hoop and shaft should be at a 90 degree angle to one another.  These 2" long 3/8" diameter tabs keep your pedals in their resting and full forward positions. The closest tab to the center of the frame should be fixed a max of 1/2" after the crosswise piece your to which your steering column is attached. The second tab should be installed 1 3/8" after the first tab.  You will weld these to the front axle of your go-kart. The spindle should have a 1" clearance above the front axle.  Use a 3/8" rod in a vise to bend it with a hammer into the shape of your passenger footrest if applicable. This will keep your feet from resting on tie rods.  This stud will serve as the pivot for your brake band. Weld a 3/8" round bar to the frame 1 1/2" after your axle.	Cut and install you steering column. Cut the steering hoop and kill switch brace. Add resting tabs for brake and throttle. Attach spindle brackets. Give yourself a foot rest. Don't forget your brake band stud.
You can typically find plenty of fake plants at your local craft store, but it’s all about finding the perfect leaves. Look for strands or branches of greenery that you can cut individual leaves from. Big maple leaves work perfectly for this, but you can use any silk leaves that you want.   If you want to save money on leaves, use the real ones. If you can find some leaves in the shape and size you want on the ground outside, there is no reason why you can't just glitter these!; , Make sure you purchase enough to cover the surface of the leaves entirely. Warm fall colors like red, yellow, orange, and gold are perfect for fall décor. You can opt for other colors, depending on the occasion or holiday you’re decorating for. The great thing about silk flowers is that they don’t die, so you can create holiday décor that you can use year after year!  , If you’ve worked with glitter before, you know it can get a bit messy. Cover the surface you’re working on with newspaper. You may want to cover the ground with newspaper as well. Then, place a smaller piece of paper on top. This is where you will shake excess glitter from the leaves, and you can pick up this smaller paper to reuse the glitter for other leaves.  Mod Podge, a water-based glue and finish, is perfect for this craft.If you have regular, everyday glue that you want to use, you may want to try thinning it out with a bit of water to make it more easily spreadable. Use your foam brush to coat one side of the leaf completely., You can use your fingers to sprinkle a bit of glitter at a time, or gently pour the glitter from the container directly onto the leaf. Add glitter until the entire surface of the leaf is covered. Then, pick up your leaf and gently shake it so that the excess glitter falls off onto your paper.You will probably need to repeat this process a few times to ensure the entire leaf is covered in glitter. You can then lift up your paper on either side and pour the glitter back into the container to use for other leaves.  The leaf may look perfect now, but it will likely leave a mess behind if you stop here. Let the first coat of glittery dry, and gently brush on another coat of your glue. This will dry transparent, and seal the glitter to the leaf. You won’t have to worry about your new décor leaving traces of glitter wherever you put it., This may or may not be necessary, depending on how you plan on displaying your leaves. If only one side of them will show, you don’t need to coat both sides with glitter. Otherwise, let the fronts of all the leaves dry, and then repeat the process on the reverse sides of the leaves.  This is a simple way to add a bit of pizazz to a holiday table or display. You can arrange them around candles or a vase of flowers for a simple yet eye-catching centerpiece. For the autumn months, glittery maple leaves look great scattered around your pumpkins. Arrange them on your bookshelf, throw them into a bowl on your coffee table, and so on. Get creative!  , Glitter leaves add instant glitz to a typical DIY fall wreath. You can add one or two glittered leaves within regular fall leaves for little pops, or you can use only glittered leaves for a really attention-grabbing display. Purchase a wire wreath base and some foliage or grasses to create a beautiful wreath to hang in your home.  If your silk leaves have stems, use them to your advantage. Tie a bit of ribbon or twine to your stems, and hang them in your home. You can hang them in a doorway like some fun, flashy garland, or hang them from your mantle to complete your holiday display.You can go nuts and hang them from doorknobs, kitchen cabinets, potted plants, and lampshades… you’ll certainly add some excitement to your space!   If your leaves don’t have stems, you can punch holes and thread your ribbon or string through these.	Find your silk leaves. Purchase your glitters of choice. Create your workspace. Use your foam brush to paint the leaf with glue. Sprinkle your glitter onto the leaf. Add another layer of glue. Repeat these steps for the backs of the leaves. Scatter them around. Create a fall wreath. Hang them with ribbons.
Look for daisies with thick stems at least 4 inches (10 cm) long. Look for healthy, fully open flowers for a more beautiful chain.; , Cut a small slit through the middle of the stem, without breaking it in half. You can cut this just below the flower, or halfway down the stem.   If your fingernails are too short, use a plastic knife.  Push the base of the stem through, until the flower is snug against the slit.  Make a slit in the next daisy and push the third stem through it. Repeat until you've made a bracelet, crown, or necklace. When you think your daisy chain is long enough, cut a second slit through the first stem. Push the last daisy through this slit to make a loop.  To keep your daisy chain for a long time, hang it up to dry in a windy area. It might wither or change color, but it should stay together.	Pick your daisies. Slit the stem with your thumbnail. Thread the stem of another daisy through the slit. Repeat with any number of daisies. Air dry the daisy (optional).
Shopping: You can buy knitting needles and yarn at any craft store including Hobby Lobby, Walmart, Target, Ben Franklin, Michaels, etc.; , Are you a fan of dull or vibrant colors? This usually means two or more.  What kind of material do you prefer - baby soft or sparkly?  , This will ultimately determine how wide you want your width to be. (25 stitches works well.)  , This is the basis for your first row of stitches.  Let your pointer finger do the work. Slide the needle under the yarn and take it behind the left needle.  Make sure that the working needle is in the back so that it’s crossing.  You have now completed one stitch.  It may feel like you are undoing your stitches by rotating them from one needle to the next, but after three or four rows you will notice your progress and hard work!  , Finished.	Determine the size of your needles. Decide how many colors you want to include in your scarf. Determine the texture of your yarn. Decide how many stitches you want to include. Make 25 loops and hook them onto one of the needles. Holding the needle with stitches in your left hand, hold the free needle with your right hand. Wrap the yarn once around the needle going counter-clockwise. Take the right needle and go under the yarn on the left needle and lift up until it comes off the needle. Transition straight into the next row. Continue this process for the remainder of the scarf.
Poi can be made by using tennis balls and rope. Put the rope through the ball and tie a knot in the end. Tie a loop in the other end of the rope. You should have two of these. Another option is the use of football (soccer) socks. If you buy poi, then it's advised to start with soft poi (bean-bag style) rather than glow poi which tend to be harder, or fire poi which are very dangerous and should only be attempted after a lot of practice.; , If you have bought poi they will probably have two loops at the end, put your index and middle finger through these.the string should be roughly the same length as your arm. , Keep practicing this trying to keep the movement equally timed on both sides("in beat"). It can often help to practice to music to keep this beat. If possible watch your reflection to make sure the poi are parallel, not crossing in front of you or spinning out.  Practice with one poi first. start by spinning as you have been doing then cross your arm in front of your chest, if possible try not to move the whole arm but focus the movement in the wrist. Mastering this helps to greatly control your movements and is essential for harder tricks. Try to move the poi in a figure of eight shape (practice without the poi first if you're scared of hitting yourself) so it crosses in front of you, circles on the opposite side, then returns to the start.  Then try with both. DON'T cross them in front at exactly the same time or they will tangle up and hit you. Instead, move them across a beat after each other(it helps if you see one as following the other). , Practice these.	Poi can be either made or purchased. Slip the looped ends of the rope over your hands. The ideal place to practice poi is either outside in good weather, or in an open space with a high ceiling indoors.  , Hold your arms down by your sides and swing both poi to get a bit of momentum going, slowly(about a second a rotation, it doesn't sound slow but its very tempting to try to go faster, at which point its harder to control) rotate your wrists so the ball spins forward. WEAVING: the most basic trick. Once you feel you have mastered this repeat with the other poi. This basic weave is the basis of many other tricks so once you've mastered that you're off to a flying start.  , Look online or ask a friend to show you some special moves.
Visit the website of the school, organization or instructor. Look for dress code instructions – many companies provide such guides online. If not, contact your instructor directly.   Try asking, “Is there a list of requirements for dance attire?” Some classes may require your attire to be modest. For example, they may prohibit certain clothing items, such as cut-off shorts.; , Select pieces that aren’t too baggy or too tight. Practice full ranges of motion in them to make sure your pieces don’t restrict or distract you.Measure your body accurately and consult with a sizing chart if you’re purchasing clothing online.Clothing should not be so tight that it deters you from any sort of movement. Clothing should not be so loose that it can tangle or get in your way. For example, avoid wearing an oversized t-shirt. For instance, try wearing jogging pants with a fitted shirt or vest.  Choose fabrics that are stretchable and soft. Avoid material that is too thin and flimsy, or the cheapest fabrics which won’t stand up well to wear and tear. Look for clothing that can go in the washer and dryer.Fabric should be somewhat thick but still stretchy. Try Lycra, jersey, cotton or silk. Remember that you’ll be washing your dance clothing often. For example, try a leotard with jazz pants.  Bring a warmup sweater and leg warmers. Layer your clothing pieces to start out, and remove a layer after you’ve warmed up.   For example, wear one or more fitted tops and a warmup sweater. Wear pants or leg warmers with shorts, if allowed. Note that some dance classes will allow you to wear leg warmers or other layered pieces during the warmup portion only.  Look for tights at your local dance boutique. Try on different tights, if possible. Move around in them and do stretches; see which ones feel the most comfortable for you.   There are many types of dance tights, such as footed, convertible, stirrup, footless and more.Tights, particularly compression tights, may assist in warming up, jumping power, injury prevention and recovery., Opt for a breathable fabric, such as canvas or leather. Look for rubber soles with traction throughout, and small heels. Pick shoes that fill well – it’s better for them to be snug than too loose.Consider how easy the shoes will be for you to clean before purchasing them.Depending on your dress policy, you might have to wear jazz shoes. Look for slip-on shoes rather than lace-up. You don’t want to be tripping on your laces! Don’t practice dance with bare feet. You’ll be jumping and stamping and need to protect your arches., Pull your hair back into a bun or ponytail, if your hair is long, to keep it out of your face. Wear a headband if you have shorter hair in the front. Add pins or clips for stubborn layers or fly-aways.   Jazz dance classes often require students to have their hair properly pulled back and secured.  Choose sweat headbands and/or arm sweatbands. Look for soft, thick, stretchy material. Use your sweatband to quickly wipe away sweat as needed.   For example, try a cotton/elastine blend. Make sure headbands are permitted in your dance class. Consider bringing a small towel with you as well.  Avoid wearing any jewelry to dance class. Don’t wear everyday accessories that can get in your way during practice. Limit your attire to dancewear.   For example, don’t wear a watch, fashion spectacles, or a scarf during class.	Check for guidelines from your instructors. Choose comfortable clothes for dance class. Find the right materials. Wear layers for warming up. Consider wearing tights. Choose jazz dance shoes or sneakers. Use hair ties. Wear sweatbands. Don’t wear extra accessories.
Twin beds are 3' x 6.25'. Double beds are 4.5' x 6.25'. Queen beds are 6' x 6.5'. King beds are 6.5' x 6.5'.  Gathered curtains are usually 1.5 to 2.0 times wider than the area they'll need to cover.  Add two inches for a one-inch ruffle at the top of the curtain. Add the width of the curtain rod plus a 1/4 inch for movement within a rod pocket. Add four inches for the lower hem. Add an inch and a half width for each hem at "both" sides of a panel. , Turn over and iron the edge of the fabric twice, to form a one-inch hemline. Stitch it in place.,  Turn over and iron a quarter-inch of fabric. Turn over the fabric a second time. This width should accommodate the width of your rod plus the height of a ruffle. If you do not want a ruffle, just accommodate for the rod.   Stitch the hem in place. Place another row of horizontal stitching between the hem and the top of the panel, accommodating for the width of the rod and ruffle.   Turn over and iron a quarter-inch of fabric. Turn over the fabric a second time to your desired measurement. Stitch it in place by hand for a nice finished look. ,        Cut a strip of fabric to your desired length and width, allowing for an extra half-inch seam allowance on all sides. With right sides together, stitch along the open edge, to form a long tube. Attach a safety pin to one end of the tube. Pass the pin through the tube, while pulling the fabric right side out. Tuck in a half-inch of fabric, at each end of a tie and stitch it together by hand. Iron the ties flat. Place a tie around the bed post, gather the panel into the tie and make a bow.	Understand approximate measurements. Measure the length and height of each side of the bed frame.Sew lengths of fabric together to enlarge the width of each panel. Hem the sides of each panel. Fold the top of each panel. Stitch the top of each panel. Hem the lower panels.Slide the rods into the pockets and hang your curtains. Make tiebacks.
This will help guide the shape of your skirt. Cut out two even pieces for the front and back. Keep the front piece of fabric as one piece, and then cut the back piece in half down the middle.Use a pencil to write out your measurements, and use a ruler to accurately place the measurements., For the back, you will need to add a vent extension to provide you room to move your legs and walk. Add 1 1/4 inches to the bottom back edges of both back pieces where the slit will start and end. At the top of that extension, make a 45 degree angle that cuts up and back.To help you cut evenly, use a clear protractor.  Once you have the proper measurements for the front and back pieces, cut them out, and use them to cut your fabric. Be sure to use sharp fabric scissors.  Turn the fabric inside-out, and then sew about 5/8" inward along the sides of the skirt., You can decide to press the center back of the seam above the vent to the left or right side when you begin sewing the seam closed.When you get to the top of your skirt, don't sew it completely closed. Instead, baste the top where the zipper will go by using larger "temporary" stitches that will hold the fabric in place. These stitches can more easily be removed when needed.  Most pencil skirts will have a better fit if they have a zipper. Place the zipper at the back of your skirt in the center. Sew on the zipper around the seam while it is still basted closed. After you sew on the zipper, you will be able to remove the larger stitches., Flip the bottom up by about 1", and tuck it inside the fabric so it is hidden. Sew the top of your skirt closed by also tucking it in about 1" inside the fabric. Make sure you do not sew closed your bottom slit or top zipper when finishing the hem lines., After you are finished, feel free to go back and make adjustments to the length or size if you feel the skirt is too small or too big. It is easy to take a skirt in, but letting a skirt out can be tricky. If you need more room, use a seam ripper to undo your seam lines, and sew closer to the edge.	Divide your measurements in half, and put them onto the paper. Make the vent. Cut out your measurements. Sew your back and front pieces together. Hem the vent and edges. Add a zipper. Hem your skirt. Flip your skirt right-side up.
Keep your arms relaxed at your sides.; , Your feet should now be about a shoulder's width apart.  Your legs should now be crossing one another.  Your feet should once again be a shoulder's width apart.  The speed of the steps will be based on the rhythm of the song your are dancing to.  The grapevine is used in popular line dances such as the Cowboy Boogie., Keep your arms relaxed at your sides. Step forward about 1-1/2 feet with your right foot.  At least part of your foot should be touching the ground the entire time.  This is the last step of the sequence.  Step forward with your left foot about 1-1/2 feet. Slide your right foot up to meet your left foot. Step forward again with your left foot.  One of the most popular line dances to use this step is the Cupid Shuffle., Kick your right foot forward a few inches above the ground, then lean forward and step on the ball of that foot, but only for a second.  Then step down with your left foot.  The kickball changeis featured in many dances, including Copperhead Road., Place your weight on the ball of your foot and pivot 90-degrees to your left.  Bring your feet back together.  Pivot turnsare used in many line dances, including the popular Cupid Shuffle,to change directions or to link other steps.  Put the above steps together to perform the Cupid Shuffle Line Dance.   Step four steps to the left using either the grapevine or a side shuffle, keeping rhythm with the song. Then make four similar steps to the right. Complete the kickball change with your left foot, followed by your right foot. Repeat the step with each foot. Pivot turn to the left, adding extra steps, turns and hip movements in tune to the music. Repeat the sequence.  You can also combine the above steps to perform the Electric Slide.   Similar to the Cupid Shuffle, the Electric Slide begins with four grapevine steps to the left followed by four to the right. After grape-vining to each side, take four shuffle steps back followed by four shuffle steps forward. Complete a kickball change with each foot. Pivot turn 90 degrees to the left.    Do one grapevine to the left, followed by a half-step with your knee up, known as a hitch. Complete the action to the right. Step forward and hitch, then step forward and hitch again. Take three steps back and hitch. "Boogie" by shaking your hips as you stand in place. Pivot step to the left, hitch and repeat.  Once in place, you can start stepping in time with the other dancers.   If there is no more room on either side of the current lines, form a new line in the front or back. The rhythm of the line dance will be based on the tempo of the song playing. Step in time with the other dancers to stay on track.  When practicing the different moves, make an effort to always be moving in a straight line either to the side, front and back. This will be especially important when you are dancing with groups of people.  While the steps and the counts or each dance are set, your own style will make your dancing stand out. You can choose how to move your hips, upper torso and arms to stand apart from the crowd.   While some line dances have arm movements built in, most of the time you can hold you arms however you're comfortable. Hold your arms steady to your sides or in front of you, or you can even make up your own arm movements, as long as they're not too distracting.  Line dances can be held at barns, nightclubs, school dances, wedding receptions or even birthday parties.	Stand with your feet together. Step out with your right foot. Step your left foot behind and to the right of your right foot.. Step out with your right foot. Place your left foot back in its original position so that you are now standing with your feet together. Repeat the steps, this time moving to the left. Stand with your feet together. Slide, or shuffle, your left foot up to meet your right foot. Step forward once again with your right foot. Repeat the move starting with your left foot. Practice doing this move to the front, to the back (stepping backward), and side to side. Stand with your feet together. Place your foot back in its original position. Repeat the move beginning with your left foot. Step forward with your right foot. Shift your weight to your left foot. Repeat the move with your left foot, this time pivoting 90-degrees to your right. Line dance to the song, "The Cupid Shuffle.", Step to the "Electric Slide.", Learn the Cowboy Boogie.The dance is a popular sequence used with many country songs. Join a line dance at any club, party or reception by walking to the end of one line. Use the four walls of a room as reference points while line dancing. Choose personal movements. Wear whatever attire is appropriate for your location.
Cut and hem your T-shirt until it rests at your midriff. Then, cut slits in the shoulders for an even cooler effect. If you want to, you can cut the side seams and hold the shirt together with safety pins or ties.  With this halter design, you cut out your T-shirt, flip it and thread a string through the hem for a gathered bodice and tie. You can also skip the bodice and tie and cut strips of fabric across the shoulders that can be turned into ties.  This article will teach you to make a tank top from an old T-shirt. You'll need some basic sewing gear and a sewing machine.  If you have a high-quality T-shirt that you want to transform, you can cut and sew the T-shirt to make a bikini. Just keep in mind to make any ties very secure--otherwise, you could end up in an awkward situation at the beach!  , In this design, the body of your T-shirt becomes the mini dress while the collar and sleeves transform into the neck strap and bodice, respectively.	Make a Crop Top. Make a Halter from an Old Shirt (No Sewing). Make a T Shirt a Tank Top. Recycle an Old T Shirt Into a Sexy Bikini. Turn an Oversized T Shirt Into a Hot Mini Dress.
Clematis wilt will cause the stems to die back to ground level. Older plants may be able to recover but younger plants will usually die completely from this occurrence.; , When planting clematis, plant it at the level of the first node. Doing this will allow the root system to develop more strongly, and new shoots will quickly form from the base of the plant. While this is not a preventative measure, it is a way of ensuring that there are plenty of regrowth opportunities should clematis wilt strike.  This will kill off any wilt pathogens residing in the root ball and give the plant a good start.  As the clematis grows, continue to spray the fungicide around the zone of the roots. Once the plant appears well established, you can stop doing this.  Don't let them dry out.  Use a mild liquid fertiliser to nourish the plant and give it steady growing strength.  If the clematis is exposed to wind and snaps, this creates a possible entry point for fungal spores. If needed, shelter or tie up young plants so that they don't risk snapping off.	Know the signs. Plant with care. Soak the root ball in fungicide before planting the clematis. Keep using fungicide. Keep young plants watered throughout the dry, hot season. Feed regularly. Keep young plants stable.
These are listed below under "Things You'll Need".; , Using the ruler, draw a rectangle from the card measuring 8.25" (21 cm) x 5.5" (13.5 cm). Cut out the rectangle with the scissors, and fold it in half so it forms a card with a surface measuring roughly 4" (10 cm) x 5.5" (13.5 cm).  Measure this piece into a 3.5" (8.5 cm) x 5" (13 cm) rectangle. Cut it out.    Glue it onto the front of your card. Make sure it is centered, so that an even border of the first colored paper (the card) shows right around it evenly.  Preferably, this is a light-colored piece of paper to ensure that your writing will show up on it.   Cut out the rectangle. Attach it inside the card, again leaving an even border around the edges. This is where you will later write your message.  Lightly sketch the design you want to create on the front of the card in pencil. As you're designing the card, consider where you want the seed beads to be applied; for example, if you only want beads in certain parts, designate the areas.   If you want to solidly cover an area in beads, it's best to start at the center of each design element, and work your way out.  Once you're happy with the design, start adding the beads to it, bit by bit.   Squeeze a very thin line of glue over the pencil lines of the design. Cover about an inch (2.5 cm) of its length. Apply the beads onto the glued area using your fingers. Use the toothpick to help shape or move beads into place as needed. Be sure to have each bead sit on the card with the holes visible from the top.    Work the design in parts or areas, so that you're not dragging your hands over glued areas. Once an area is coated with beads, move on to the next one with the glue, and then the beads. Continue adjusting any parts of the design as you go; sometimes new design additions will appear to you as you're working on the card.  Write your message inside and place in an envelope for completion.	Collect the materials. Choose a piece of colored paper to make the card. Choose another differently-colored piece of paper to form the front of the card. Measure a third piece of colored paper into a 3.5" (8.5 cm) x 5" (13 cm) rectangle. Decorate the card once it is assembled. Start applying the seed beads to the design. Continue to cover the design areas set aside for the beads. Allow the card to dry thoroughly before writing anything inside. Finished.
How long you cut the chicken wire depends on how wide and how tall you want your arch to be. If the chicken wire is very wide, you may want to cut it narrower. This will make it easier to bend and curve it into an arch shape.  It can be a perfect arch or a warped one. If you need to, loosely crumple or fold the wire in half lengthwise to make it thinner., You can do this with nails, thumb tacks, or pushpins. Start at one end of the chicken wire and work your way upwards to the peak, then work your way back down to the other end.The arch does not have to be perfectly symmetrical. Try a warped arch for a more organic design.  For a more interesting design, blow up balloons in different sizes and colors. Try some water balloons, regular balloons, and jumbo balloons. You can also blow up regular balloons with varying amounts of air.Do not use a helium tank for this. You can blow the balloons up with your mouth, but your lungs may get tired.  Place a glue dot to the tail end of the balloon, just below the knot. Wrap the tail behind the wire, then press it against the knot. Hold the tail and knot together for about 10 seconds before letting go. This ensures a secure bond.You can find glue dots in the scrapbooking section or an arts and crafts store. They are dots of glue that come on a strip. Peel them off one at a time as you use them.  Make sure that you place it close enough to the first balloon so that they are touching. Find the spot where the two balloons touch, then place another glue dot between them., Create clusters of balloons. Start with the larger ones first, then work your way towards the smaller ones. You can even place smaller balloons over larger ones using glue dots., Dried or fresh flowers work especially well for this, but you can use fake ones too. You can also tuck some colorful ribbon in between the balloons instead. This is also a great way to hide any gaps and give your balloon arch a more organic feel.   Secure the flowers to the chicken wire with glue dots or string.Make sure that the flowers don't have any thorns. If they do, cut them off with a crafting blade.	Use wire cutters to cut chicken wire for your arch. Bend the chicken wire into the shape you want it to be. Secure the arch to your wall. Blow up your balloons using a balloon pump. Secure the first balloon to the base of the arch. Attach the next balloon in a similar fashion. Work your way around the arch. Consider adding fillers.
will fall from the clothes you're washing and wind up inside of the pump. These objects can cause cracks in the pump body making the pump leak.;	Sometimes items like coins, paper clips, screws, nails, etc.
For best posture and reach, make sure that when you are sitting your feet are flat on the floor. Also, be sure that you can comfortably reach the pedals without having to move in your seat while playing.; , Instead of coming at an angle, position your right and left foot so that the big toe of each foot is in line with the far left and right pedals. Since you won’t be able to look at the pedals while you play piano, keeping your legs and feet straight will help you find the pedals blindly.  Use the ball of your foot to cover only the rounded end of the pedal.Depress the pedals by pivoting your foot up and down, using only the front part of your foot. Release pedals with smooth movements because lifting a pedal abruptly and not gently will create jerky chord progressions and choppy notes.   Only use the front part of your foot to press down so that you don’t move your entire leg each time which slows down your playing. Your right foot is only used to press down the damper pedal which is the one on the far right. Your left foot plays both the soft pedal and sostenuto pedals which are the far left and middle pedal, respectively.  Use only the ball of your foot to depress the pedals and keeping your heels planted. By isolating those smaller foot muscles, you’re using fine motor skills to operate the pedals more sensitively and skillfully.  You can press a pedal down all the way, halfway, or a quarter of the way down. Each increment changes an aspect of the piano’s sound while you’re playing. Take the time to play around and listen to the changes in a note’s sound quality as you adjust the pedal.   Pressing any of the pedals lifts the dampers inside the piano. Lifting the dampers allows the strings that are attached to the piano keys to vibrate and make sounds. Pushing a pedal part of the way down only partially lifts the dampers, so the pedal’s effects are diminished.  On the far right of your pedal set is the damper which is the most commonly used one. This pedal lifts all dampers from the stings of the keys so that they can vibrate freely. Keep this pedal depressed to join notes together smoothly, make a group of chords crescendo, or to make a piece music resonate as it ends.Depending a musical notations, depress the damper pedal before, at the same time, or after you play a note. Each difference in timing produces unique sound effects.The dampers on all the strings are raised when the damper pedal is used, as well as the intended ones. The one set of strings’ vibrations causes sympathetic vibrations with all the other strings and also sustains the notes played until the pedal is released.  Press the far left pedal when you play a note or chord whose quality of sound you want to soften. You can mute or incorporate an ethereal tone to your piano playing by interspersing this pedal throughout a piece.   The soft pedal manipulates the hammer that strikes the strings that are attached to any key that you play. Different keys have different amounts of strings and using the soft pedal shifts the hammer to strike fewer strings for a more muted sound. You can still play loudly while pressing the soft pedal. Striking keys harder than normal will override the effect of the soft pedal. Don’t use the soft pedal as an excuse not to learn to play softly. You should still be able to control your fingers to play keys quietly without a pedal., Press the sostenuto pedal at the same time as a note or chord that you want to accentuate and sustain. The sostenuto pedal will prolong the sound of that particular note while you play other notes that are unaffected by the pedal.For example, you can play a bass note and at the same time depress the sostenuto so that you can prolong the bass note while playing staccato soprano keys that are not sustained. You can still use the damper pedal while using the sostenuto. This allows you to give multiple notes different dynamics all at the same time., Each pedal is notated by a different abbreviated word or symbol on a sheet of music. These notations are usually found running underneath of the staff for the treble or bass clef.To depress or engage the damper pedal, you will see either “ped.” in plain or flourished script. Soft pedal markings on a sheet of music appear as “una corda” to tell you to use it and “tre corde” to stop.The sostenuto isn’t used very often but when a piece of music calls for it, there will be markings that read “sost. ped.”When the composer wants you to release a pedal, there will be a symbol that resembles an asterisk (*).  Depending on when you play a note or chord and when you depress a pedal, you can create various sound effects. It takes practice to be able to play the piano with hands while also paying attention to where and when your feet are moving on the pedals. As you practice, go slowly so that your brain can become accustomed to multitasking.Preliminary pedaling is when you use a pedal before playing a note. This gives off a deep, rich sound because the dampers are taken off the keys and the strings are allowed to vibrate and create sound freely. Use a pedal while simultaneously playing a note to accentuate its sound. When you play notes while holding down the damper pedal, you accumulate volume, or cause a crescendo that grows louder as it is sustained. Change or disengage and reengage the pedal often to help maintain tonal quality and integrity. Holding down a pedal can muddy up the sound.  You may come across a piece of music that is void of pedal markings. As you practice the piece, pay attention to the overall tone and theme of the music. A fast-paced tune might not need a lot of damper pedal whereas a somber piece might benefit from the damper pedal as well as the soft pedal for a melancholy effect.	Adjust your seat or bench at the piano. Line up your feet up with the pedals. Practice pressing down and up on each pedal. Keep your heels on the floor while playing. Experiment with how far you depress the pedals. Control the damper pedal with your right foot. Depress the soft pedal with your left foot. Layer notes with the sostenuto pedal. Watch for pedal markings on sheet music. Coordinate your hand and foot movements. Use your own discretion when there aren’t any markings.
Take measurements of all the windows that you will cover with vinyl blinds.   Use a tape measure to get the length of the window. Start at the top of the window, and pull the tape measure down to the bottom of the window. Use a tape measure to get the width of the window. Start at the left of the window and pull the tape measure to the right until you get to the end of the window.; ,   Choose vertical blinds if you are covering a long window or a sliding door. Vertical blinds also work well in offices. Select horizontal blinds for a softer, more modern look. Vinyl blinds that hang horizontally are used most often on windows in homes.  Most horizontal vinyl blinds come with slats that are half an inch (1.27 cm) or 2 inches (5 cm).   Buy blinds with a larger slat width for extra privacy and to keep the sun out. Look for a smaller slat size for more texture and style.  Most vinyl blinds are available in a shade of white. You can find different colors to match your décor and curtains, however.  Look for vinyl blinds in your window measurements at home improvement stores such as Lowe's and Home Depot.   Check department stores, such as Target, Sears and Walmart. Shop online for a larger selection and lower prices. You may be able to find additional options for vinyl blinds online. You can also compare prices.  If you will be hanging the blinds yourself, make sure you understand how to do it.   Check the packaging for instructions. If you cannot find them, ask a sales associate.  You might get the blinds home and decide you do not like them. Make sure you can bring them back.  If you have a window that is an unusual size, you might need to have blinds made for you. Talk to an associate in a store, or check online sites such as Blinds.com.	Measure your windows. Decide if vertical or horizontal blinds will work best. Consider your slat width. Choose a color. Shop around. Read the installation instructions. Ask about return policies. Consider custom vinyl blinds.
Be sure to use a clean potato, so wash it first if it is coated in soil. This is a good opportunity to use up an old potato that has started to sprout and is past its best.   You can also use up the potatoes going green.; , Wipe from side to side to cover all of the window. This will clean it and leave a layer that will prevent condensation from forming on the window.   If you notice starch streaks forming, wipe them off. You may need to wipe more quickly to avoid leaving any streaks. You can also cut off dirtied slices or parts of the potato half and continue with the clean part.  If you're doing all of the windows, you'll probably need to use up both potato halves.  The potato juice should dry clear and the windows will remain fog-free, as the starch in the potato acts as a barrier between the glass and the air.   While the potato film is drying, don't touch it or you'll leave fingerprints dirtying the window. Throw the used potato into the compost.	Cut a raw potato in half. Rub the cut side of one half potato on the window. Use the other half of the potato if needed. Leave to dry without touching.
If you haven't chosen one yet, consider reading the wikiHow on "How to Choose Bamboo for Garden or Landscape" (Coming soon!). If you received an unidentified bamboo from a friend, ask bamboo-friendly nurseries or online newsgroups for help in identifying it. Bamboos have a wide variety of temperature and sun requirements. Some are more or less tolerant of drought or water saturated conditions. Knowing the needs of your plant is critical to your success in growing it.; , Bamboos typically like as much water as a healthy lawn. Some of the larger species need a bit more. It will make maintenance a lot easier if you put your bamboo near the edge of a stream, or in a location where water is already being handled. However, note that bamboos can not endure being kept soggy. They will not grow in swamp or other saturated areas. The ideal is to have high drainage soil with frequent watering.  Almost all clumping bamboos will grow well in partial shade. Many of them can be severely harmed by too much direct sun. However, the largest clumping bamboos require full sun to attain their full size. The sun preference of bamboos is typically rated on a 1 to 5 scale where 1 is full shade and 5 is full sun.  Clumping (pachymorph or sympodial) bamboos are fairly compact. Most varieties will not fill a square meter of ground for 20 or more years. However, the largest of tropical species can put up culms 15cm or more in diameter, and will need an area 2 or more meters around at maturity.  It is much more difficult to improve soil once the bamboo is planted. Till the ground and mix in as much organic matter as you can afford. Up to half of the soil can be replaced with peat moss or well composted steer manure. Loosen the soil and add organic material to a depth of 30 to 45cm (12 to 18 inches) if you are able.  Make it about an inch deeper than the soil in the pot it is coming out of.  It is okay to make a bit of a soupy mess. , Then fill in around the plant, making sure to get firm soil contact with the soil and roots from the pot.  It is okay if the plant ends up a few inches below ground level, as it will self-adjust its depth, and being deep at first will give it some additional shelter in its first summer or winter.  This should be about twice the diameter of the pot the plant came out of, and 2 to 3 inches high.  Small bark chips, straw, or grass cuttings make good mulch. However, bark chips usually have a lot less weed seed mixed in with them.  But let it get to where it is only damp before watering again. Keeping a bamboo too wet is not good for it, and encourages rot.	Identify the bamboo you wish to plant. Consider the water requirements of the bamboo. Consider the sunlight needs of your bamboo. Consider the space requirements of your bamboo. Prepare the soil. Dig the hole for the bamboo to go in. Wet the hole thoroughly. Being very careful to avoid damaging any soft new shoots or culms the plant might have, take the plant out of its pot and put it in the hole.  , If the plant had any culms pointing out in an undesirable direction, it is fine to straighten it up to vertical at this point. Again, being careful not to break any new shoots, press down firmly on the plant to insure good contact in the bottom of the hole. Make a berm to help direct water to stay around the plant. Fill the berm with mulch. Water the bamboo again to help the different soil layers merge together and connect with the roots.
This means adding elements to it that represent who you are, and not what everyone else is doing. Magazines, designers, experts or the internet comes with a lot to choose from.; , For many people, this can often be interpreted as being less spartan and more homely, with trinkets, photos, special things, stuffed toys and comfortable elements placed everywhere in the room. Before you do anything, ask yourself: "Am I a minimalist or a maximalist?" Then you will have a good idea of whether you'd like to add more or less things to the room.  Not all colors make you feel the same way. If you would like a group of members to like the new wall color, think about what you all collectively like or could be fine with. This color must be one that everyone collectively like and not just are 'okay' with.   Olive green gives a rich feel some feel. Typically shades of green give energy. Warmth and brightness brought by reds, oranges, pinks and yellows are often associated with a room that has feeling. Blue creates a feeling of strength and acceptance. All colors bring a story with it. Certain colors remind you of your personal memory. Hence, you must consider what you like and be willing to carry on with your likes.  You may go simple with all the walls with the same color or all four walls with four different colors. You may also choose two walls with the same color and the other two facing walls with the same.  The best way to know how your room will look after it is done is through creative visualization.   You may create a 3D room through computer applications or MS paint to see how exactly or roughly your room will look. Checking online for how a certain color, combination of colors, or textures look is a good idea.  This could involve making big changes with the wall coloring and then texturing it or it could be done via adding objects that bring in their textures to compliment the room. For adding different or any great texture you could add items that are texturally delightful.  Upholstery includes the curtains, mats, carpets, or any fabric used in the room. This aspect of a room could be used to change the feel of the room dramatically from dull to stunning. You could do it tastefully in the following ways.   Choose cozy throw rugs, comfortable cushions, billowy pillows, soft rugs and smooth curtains for the room. Prefer fabrics that are nice to touch. You may choose from linens, cottons, burlap, velvet, satin and other such fabrics are wonderful choices. Organza and other see-through fabrics can make nice wispy statements.  Pick a soft feathery carpet or a royal looking one as per your choice. Use soft or textured furniture covers and cushions. Using beautiful, vibrant and colorful curtains. You may add bells or fancy dangling objects to hang with the curtains. To spruce up the curtains up a notch you may consider adding a dash of color to the curtain tiebacks. To make a bold statement you may choose prominent metallic finished ones. Curtain tiebacks could either go with the rest of the color scheme or create a contrast for a more fun and lively look.  If you like some colors, even if they're not traditional you may go ahead with it and make your room special in every way. For example, if your favorite color is blue, add blue things to the room, such as a blue armchair, table mat, wall hangings, wind chime etc.  You can use some statement pieces to add more feelings to your room. Accessories, art pieces, paintings, sculptures, posters, etc which would do it for you. A combination of well-placed decorative items will add much aesthetic value to it and give out lively vibes for everyone to delve in.   If you want to create a rich archaic feel you may buy beautifully designed old styled items to go with your room. Place paintings on the walls. You don't have to spend a lot on these if you don't want to. You may paint one yourself or ask a friend who is artistically proficient to paint them for you. You may visit a thrift store or a auction house and pick up some fantastic paintings for next-to-nothing.  Choose paintings with lively, fun and interesting subject matter, as well as choosing pictures that have special meaning for you.   Add posters to the walls. These could be of places you'd like to visit or have visited, bands you like listening to, science fiction or science themes, animals, or more.  Consider the lighting of the room with keen attention. Lighting can change the mood of a room dramatically and can help to make it feel cozier and more lived in.   Choose between lights that give out different effect. Choose lamps that are very colorful, ornate, both or just plain depending upon what you prefer. You may add extra lamps too. Consider using some fairy lights or Christmas lights to give a festive feeling.	Personalize the room. Remember, less or more. Choose between colors. Choose a combination of colors. Visualize. Add textures. Implement the basics of upholstery. Play with your favorite colors. Decorative objects. Lights.
Electric start engines should be tilted down so that the propeller is in the water. This will allow the fuel to readily flow into the engine during starting. Keeping the engine tilted down also keeps the propeller safely in the water while starting.On rare occasions, boats are equipped with fully electric outboard motors. These motors still have electric starters, and the starting procedure is the same as the procedure for a fuel driven motor with an electric start.  Electric engines require the key to be in the ignition before important features, such as the gearshift, will operate. Insert the key into the ignition slot, and if necessary insert the kill switch, too. This should enable you to shift the engine to neutral, An electric motor may have a manual gearshift that you can move to neutral. Alternatively, you may have to move the throttle to the neutral position. This will allow you to start the engine., You start most engines by turning the key to the “On” position. Some engines will have a start button that you must push. Once the engine starts, release the key or button.	Tilt the engine down. Insert the key. Put the motor in neutral. Turn the key.
Light colors tend to add to the visual space of a place, rather than detract. Consider replacing reds and browns with whites and creams. In the end, the lighter and brighter the colors you use, the more spacious home will feel.  Replace dark paint with light paint. Replace dark colored furniture. Remove dark carpets.; , A great way to open a room – or your whole home – is to leave windows uncovered. You can do this by either by taking down blinds and drapes, or installing blinds and drapes that have less of a presence. In the end, the more natural light you let in and the less stuff crowding your windows and walls, the more open your home will feel.If you do have blinds or other window treatments, keep them open during the day.  Light tends to open rooms and spaces much more than anything else you can do. To add more light, open your blinds or install more or brighter lights. Ultimately, a brighter space will appear bigger to you and your guests.Try replacing old bulbs with brighter LED or other types of bulbs before you install new lighting. Opt for cool white or “daylight” light instead of warm yellow or orange light. Add a table lamp, free standing lamp, or install some recessed lighting to add light to a space.  Strategically place mirrors around your home to create an airier feel. Mirrors are an easy way to create the appearance of more space in areas that may feel cramped. Look around your home to see where you can put a mirror. Some places might include:Your entryway or parlor Hallways Mudrooms Guest bedrooms Bathrooms  , Walk through your home and take a good look at how you’ve positioned and spaced your furniture. If you find that you have furniture taking up entire walls or squished together in certain areas, you may need to rearrange your furniture.  Consider allowing 6 inches (15 cm) between end tables and couches, instead of right on top of each other. The same goes for positioning nightstands next to beds – space them apart by 6 inches (15 cm). Don’t push your couch completely against a wall. Instead, space it 1 to 3 feet (.3 to .9 m) off the wall., Place your furniture so you and your guests can easily walk around and through your home. You want to create the feeling that a person can flow from one living space to another without being slowed by furniture that might be in the way.  When placing furniture in a parlor or sitting area, make sure people can enter through the doorway into the middle of the room before taking a seat. When placing furniture in a living room or family room, make sure you and your guests can walk into the middle of the room before sitting down. If you have a couch or coffee table blocking people’s walkway, you may have to rearrange it., An easy way to create more visual space is to use furniture that has exposed or raised legs. By purchasing couches, china cabinets, and other pieces of furniture that are raised with legs, you’ll create much more visual space., Perhaps the easiest way to create more visual space is to get rid of unnecessary furniture. If you have items – couches, desks, bookshelves – that you don’t really use or don’t really need, get rid of them. You’ll find that once you downsize your furniture, your home will feel much larger., Walk around your home and take a good look at your walls. Take stock of paintings, photographs, and other artwork you have on your walls. If you find yourself having a difficult time locating open wall space, then you may have a problem. Make sure you have some areas of your wall that are open.There are no universal rules about how much wall space you need to have. However, some decorators suggest leaving two inches between large pictures and an inch and a half (5 to 3.8 cm) between smaller ones. Large pictures should be about 60 inches (152 centimeters) off the ground.  Take stock of items you have on top of desks, side tables, bookshelves, and elsewhere in your home. Then, reduce this number. Display only your best pieces of art work or your most memorable keepsakes. Store the others and consider rotating the items you have on display., One of the most common things that ruins the illusion of space in a home are items stacked on pieces of furniture or on bookshelves. Instead of doing this, you should store books and other items inside furniture that has cabinets.If you have a lot of books, buy bookshelves with cabinets. Either the entire bookshelf can have cabinets, or just the lower part. If you have a lot of dishes displaced in your dining room or kitchen, put them in cabinet. If you want people to see them, consider getting glass cabinets. This will add character but create a neat and open look instead of a crowded look.	Redecorate your home using light colors. Leave your windows uncovered. Add more light to dark rooms. Use mirrors to create the illusion of space. Avoid clustering furniture close together or on walls. Arrange furniture to create open space and a flow. Use furniture with exposed legs. Get rid of unnecessary furniture. Avoid putting too many things on your walls. Limit the items you display. Store things in furniture with cabinets.
In order to figure out what type of hydrangea to plant, you'll need to figure out which variety is best for your gardening zone. Start by looking at a planting zone hardiness mapto determine the number of your zone. There are hundreds of varieties of hydrangeas to choose from. If this is your first time planting these beautiful flowers, you may want to choose from among these common varieties that are known to be hardy and produce long-lasting blooms.Mophead and lacecap hydrangeas, or "bigleaf" hydrangeas, grow well in zone 8, which has a warm climate. They don't do as well in colder regions unless you take measures to protect them from frost.. Look for the "Endless Summer" mop-head variety at your local nursery - it's a type of mophead hydrangea that blooms more than once over the summer. This type of hydrangea produces large balls of pink or blue blossoms that deepen in color over the course of the season. The oakleaf hydrangea grows well in places with very hot summers without too much moisture. It is hardy through zone 4b/5a. This type of hydrangea has white blossoms. Annabelle hydrangeas are more cold hardy than mophead or oakleaf hydrangeas, can still grow in zone 3. This type of hydrangea has white blossoms that turn light green later in the season. Peegee hydrangeas can grow hardy even further north than Annabelles - all the way up to zone 3a. They are also able to grow in southern zones. They have white blossoms.; , Planting in one of these milder seasons will give the hydrangeas time to acclimate to the soil conditions and take root before the weather gets more extreme. Look for hydrangea plants in your nursery in early spring or early fall., Hydrangeas are easy to grow either in planting beds or in large pots. Whichever method you choose, you'll need a spot that gets full sun in the morning and partial shade in the afternoon. Bigleaf hydrangeas will grow in complete partial shade, so choose this variety if you have a shady yard., Hydrangeas need rich, well-drained soil that is kept moist. If you're working with dry or depleted soil, get it ready for hydrangeas by working in some compost. If your soil tends to hold water, you can add peat to help with drainage.  The hold you dig should be as deep as the root ball on the hydrangea plant, and at least twice as wide. Use a spade or shovel to dig a big hole to accommodate the plant's roots. If you're planting more than one hydrangea, they should be spaced 5–7 feet (1.5–2.1 m) apart, since the plants can grow to get very large.   Check the instructions that came with your particular hydrangea variety. Some hydrangeas can be planted closer together, while others may need to be planted at least 10 feet (3.0 m) apart., It's important to make sure the roots of the hydrangea get watered at the time of planting, so start by setting the hydrangea's root ball in the hole you dug. Fill the hole with a few inches of water and let it drain thoroughly, then fill the hole with soil and water it once more. Pat it down around the base of the hydrangea.   Planting hydrangeas too deeply can cause the roots to fail. If not planted deep enough, your hydrangeas could fall over in heavy rain or strong wind.  Hydrangeas will begin to wilt if the soil gets too dry, so make sure you water them every day or two, especially during the hot summer months. Water the hydrangeas near the base of the plants and above the roots, rather than spraying the water directly onto the flowers; this prevents the flowers from getting burned by the sun.  New hydrangeas do not need to be pruned; if you do so, you may not get new blossoms the following spring. If you have older hydrangeas that have gotten quite large and need to be cut back, make sure you prune at the right time of year according to the variety of hydrangea you planted.   Bigleaf hydrangea varieties should be pruned after the blossoms have faded in the late spring. Oakleaf and other hydrangeas that bloom on the current season's wood should be pruned while the plant is still dormant, in late winter before the blooms emerge., Cover them with mulch, straw, or pine needles to a depth of at least 18 inches (45.7 cm). If you have smaller bushes, you can cover the entire plant for the winter. Remove the cover in early spring, after the last frost.  The color of hydrangeas depends on the pH of the soil in which they are planted. If you have pink or blue hydrangeas, it's possible to change their color by changing the soil's pH. This can take weeks or months, so be patient!   To change flowers from pink to blue, lower the soil's pH by adding sulfur or peat moss. To change flowers from blue to pink (which is more difficult than changing from pink to blue), add limestone to the soil to raise the soil's pH.White hydrangea blossoms don't change color.  Wait until the color is rich and the flowers have a papery, rather than juicy, consistency. This will make the flowers easier to dry. Use a scissors or pruning tool to cut the stems.  Hydrangeas preserve beautifully when dried. Their color stays bright for a long time, and they hold their shape for years before disintegrating. To dry hydrangeas, use one of the following methods:   Hang them upside down. Tape the stems to the top of a doorway in a dry, dark room. Let them hang until they completely dry, then remove them and arrange them in a vase. Dry them in water. Place the stems in a vase filled with a few inches of water. Allow the flowers to slowly dry as the water evaporates. Use silica gel. Place the blossoms in a container and cover completely with silica gel. After a week or two, the flowers will be dry, their color perfectly preserved.	Choose a hydrangea variety. Plan to plant in the spring or fall. Find a good planting spot. Enrich the soil with compost. Dig a wide hole in the soil. Plant the hydrangea. Keep the soil moist. Prune only when necessary. Protect hydrangeas over the winter. Change the color of hydrangeas. Harvest hydrangeas when the flowers are mature. Dry hydrangeas to preserve them.
When you're shopping for a new disposal, there are several factors to take into consideration. Think about who will be using the disposal, whether a noisy disposal is an issue in your household, and what kind of plumbing you have at your home.          If you have children who will be using the disposal, consider getting a batch feed disposal rather than a continuous feed disposal. Batch feed disposals, which are a bit more expensive, require the use of a stopper prior to operation, which can be safer in households with kids. Continuous feed disposals start running when you flip a switch and keep running when you switch it off. If someone drops a utensil down the drain or sticks their hand inside, this can be a dangerous situation. Choose a motor that's right for your household. Models with lower horsepower, usually about 1/3, are suitable for small households with a small amount of food waste. Models with 1/2 horsepower are better for larger households with more food waste. Consider the features you want the disposal to have. For a higher price, you can buy a disposal made to function more quietly, one made from stainless steel, or one that connects to your dishwasher. If your plumbing is connected to a septic tank, you need to buy a disposal made especially for septic tanks.; , In addition to an appropriate garbage disposal, you'll need the following equipment to complete the installation:          A screwdriver A disposer wrench A hacksaw Water pump pliers Plumber's putty Electrical cord Safety supplies, including goggles and a dust mask  , Make sure the power to the garbage disposal is turned off while you're installing it. Cover the panel box to make sure no one can turn it back on until the job is complete.  Not all disposals are connected to a dishwasher, but if yours is, use a screwdriver to loosen and detach the hose attaching the disposal to your dishwasher.  Remove the "P" trap waste line running from the disposal by using a wrench to unscrew the slip-nut connecting the disposal to the trap. You might want to place a bucket under the trap to catch any wastewater sitting in the bottom.  Remove the disposal by inserting a screwdriver into the mounting ring lug and turning counterclockwise until it comes loose.  Remove the ring on the sink sleeve, the sink sleeve, the flange, the fiber gasket, and the plumber's putty. Finish preparing the sink for the new disposal by cleaning the sleeve, flange and sink opening.  Some disposals come with appliance wires attached, and others do not. If yours doesn't, remove the cover plate beneath the disposal and attach the wires according the manufacturer's instructions. Most standard disposals have you attach white wires to white wires and black wires to black wires. When you're finished, screw the cover plate back on.  Roll plumber's putty between your hands to form a snake about 1/2-inch thick and 10 inches (25.4 cm) long. Apply it to the underside of the drain flange under the sink. Insert the flange into the drain hole and press down evenly to attach it. Then snap on the backup ring, fiber gasket and mounting ring.          Working from beneath the sink, use a screwdriver to screw the mounting ring tightly against the sink. It helps to alternate sides, screwing one screw and switching to the other, so that the mounting ring tightens evenly. Some of the plumber's putty will have squeezed out around the flange. Use a knife to trim it away.  Place the disposal into the mounting ring, making sure that the disposal's outlet is facing the drain pipe connection. Tighten it until the disposal stays in place.  Measure the discharge pipe and use a hacksaw to cut it to size, then attach it to the outlet on the disposal. Be sure to read the manufacturer's instructions to make sure you connect it properly. Attach the dishwater discharge tube as well.  Turn the power back on, run water into the sink and turn on the disposal to make sure it works. Check underneath to be sure there aren't any leaks. Run some food through the disposal to be sure it grinds and gets disposed of properly.	Figure out what kind of garbage disposal you need. Gather tools and other supplies. Turn off the power. Detach the dishwasher hose. Detach the waste line. Take off the disposal. Take apart the rest of the mounting assembly. Wire the disposal. Install the drain flange and mounting ring. Mount the disposal. Connect the disposal to the P-trap. Check the disposal.
One helpful way to do this is by placing a piece of tap on all the keys and labeling them.; , You will be using the keys F, G, A and C of the lower side of the piano. In order to do this, you could follow these arrangements for your left hand:   Place pinky on the F key. Place ring finger on the G key. Place middle/index finger on the A key. Place your thumb on the C key.  Continue practicing playing these keys smoothly until you are able to without much concentration.    Start by pressing the middle C three times. Wait after a second, hit the C again and continue playing by descending down. Play the keys left of C: B and A. Now ascend again by playing B, C, D and hit the E three times. Hit the E once more, then play the two descending keys of it: D and C. Continue by playing the ascending keys D, E, F and G. After playing the key G, pause for a second and play the C you initially started at. Now you're going to wait another second before playing the A key right of the C. Descend from A by playing G, F, E, D, C, B, A, G, F. Finish by ascending from F, playing F# (the black key to the right of F), G, A, B, and stopping at C.  Once you've mastered both the keys of your left and right hands, you will be able to play the melody.  Your left hand should play each of the four notes only after a second passes: play C, pause for a second, play A, pause for a second, play F, pause for a second, play G, pause for a second, and repeat.   Your right hand's tempo is quicker than the left hand's and only slows down for a second after specific keys. Begin by playing both hands simultaneously.  Don't feel discouraged if it seems hard to get at first. You can do it!	If you're a beginner, familiarize yourself with the keys. Start by focusing on just your left hand. Play the keys in this order with your left hand: C, A, F, G.   Play each key once then pause for a second, then play the next, repeat this. Now it's time to focus on your right hand!, Practice until you understand the rhythm of the song and are capable of playing it without much hesitation or concentration.

After 9/11 many American families have created special emergency kits to help them survive in the event of another tragedy. Regardless of the threat, an emergency supply kit can help you to stay alive during the early days following an outbreak or disaster. Items you should include:   Water. One gallon per person per day. If it’s possible, maintain at least a three day supply. Non-perishable food. Choose food that is easy to open, easy to store that does not attract bugs (or zombies). Also, select items that provide enough calories and nutrition to sustain life for several hours such as energy bars, peanut butter and nuts. If you have a baby, maintain a week’s supply of formula or baby food. Since you probably won’t be able to run your dishwasher, keep a pack of plastic forks, spoons, paper plates, paper towels and plastic cups on hand. Prescription and non prescription medication. Since you can’t anticipate when a disaster or zombie attack could possibly happen, always keep an extra month’s supply of prescription medicine on-hand. Non prescription medicine should include pain relievers, antihistamines and anti-diarrhea medication. First aid kit. You don't want to be bleeding all over the place regardless if you are running from zombies or trying to survive a natural or man-made disaster. Pack bandages of all sizes, blister bandages and a few ACE bandages. Include antibacterial cream to avoid infection. Toiletries. Most likely your electricity will be disconnected, so maintaining supplies that will keep you clean (and smelling fresh) will be vital to your survival. Include deodorant, waterless shampoo and antibacterial waterless hand soap. If you have a baby, don’t forget diapers and wipes. Tools. Put yourself in the shoes of a Boy Scout and think about the tools you might need to survive in the wilderness. Pocket knives, duct tape, flashlights, bleach, batteries, candles, matches and a hammer are a good place to start. Pet supplies. Don’t forget about the family pet. Same rules apply to Fido in terms of food, water and medication. Generator and gas. In the event you lose electricity following a disaster, keep a few cans of gas in the garage and have your generator primed and ready to go at any minute. Test your generator every year to ensure it’s still in working order and have it flushed after each use.; , Chances are you will be taken by surprise during a disaster of zombie-like proportions and in order to stay one step ahead, gather the troops and have a “what if” discussion. Review the family’s daily schedule and identify a “go to” safe spot in the event of a disaster like a zombie attack. Determine how you could come together as a family once the area has been deemed safe or cleared. Could you walk home if necessary or will you require car, bus or train transportation? If you typically ride public transportation and there is no way you can walk home, identify a peer who has a car and find out if you could get a ride, should disaster strike. You should also consider what to do if you can’t locate a member of your family. Who will be elected to go on the search and when? Ultimately your best bet would be to communicate by cell phone, however you can’t depend on the network to be up and running--that’s why a solid emergency plan is imperative.  During emergency situations, "good" people can do terrible things. In addition to having to worry about the usual dangers lurking outside, anarchist looters may try to move in and take what’s rightfully yours. Think about what it will take to secure your home and personal property from harm’s way.   Examine all locks on windows and doors. Do you have any doors or windows that don’t close properly or are broken? Have all entryways to your home evaluated by a professional to ensure that no one could forcefully enter your home? Lock cars and secure recreational toys such as motorcycles, boats and jet skis. Bring in outdoor items that could be used as weapons or could become air born. Looters (or angry zombies) could use items such as large potted plants and lawn furniture to smash windows. Also, during a hurricane or tornado, those items could become flying "missiles" and create endless amounts of damage.  Every disaster situation is different and hopefully government agencies are communicating with the public every step of the way. However, during the early days following an outbreak or disaster the public is often on their own. Examine your unique situation and consider the safest way to conduct yourself until help arrives.   Look for dangerous patterns within the community. If you know that you will be in the most danger at night, don’t go outside at that time. Be hyper-aware of your surroundings and never let your guard down while in public or outside. Make your trips into the community brief. In addition to being worried about being eaten during a zombie attack, most disasters will wreak havoc on structures--power lines may be down and on the ground and building materials may line the street. You could actually survive the disaster but then be electrocuted because you didn’t see the downed power line on the sidewalk. Practice safe behavior. If you could become infected with a deadly disease or be attacked on the street, don’t spend your day hanging out in the town’s square. Use your common sense and make every effort to avoid trouble.  From national to local government agencies; many have planned for a variety of disaster scenarios and should have a hardwired plan ready for implementation. Stay informed by trying to contact your local officials first and then state and national groups if you don’t get answers immediately.  You don’t have to be suspicious of the little old lady down the street, but it’s good to know which neighbors will have your back. Keep a list of emergency friends and family members near your emergency kit. You may want to have a discussion or an agreement with neighbors before disaster strikes to know how you can help each other.	Stock up on emergency supplies. Have an emergency family plan. Secure your property. Know what you are up against. Have emergency names and numbers on-hand. Know who you can trust.
Unlike many animated characters, Elsa sports a few different hairstyles. Choose from any of these looks:   At her coronation, Elsa wears her hair in an elegant updo that is essentially a braid twisted up into a bun. Instead of tucking her bangs into the bun, she wears them straight and forward. The hairstyle Elsa is depicted as wearing most is part of her "Snow Queen" look and is essentially her coronation bun undone. This hairstyle consists of a simple fishtail braid that falls forward over her left shoulder and slicked-back bangs. Be sure to volumize your hair at the crown with a little gentle teasing. This hairstyle looks more relaxed compared to her coronation updo and is much fluffier. When Elsa was a child, she wore her hair similarly to how she does in her Snow Queen look. The major differences are that when she was a child she wore her braid with a blue headband and bangs and let it fall to her back. In the short Frozen Fever, Elsa alternates her Snow Queen hair with pink flower barrettes, plus a purple, snowflake-embellished flower accessory to the right of her hair. The main thing about Elsa's hair to remember is that it is a very light, almost white platinum blonde. If this isn't your natural hair colour, you could optionally achieve it with one or more treatments with bleach, maybe wear a similar wig. However, Elsa could have had a naturally darker hair colour, like her parents, if she didn't have her ice powers. As long as the hairstyle gives some idea of Elsa, any hair colour will be more or less fine.  Elsa wears a few different costumes you can choose to follow. You may decide to copy these outfits exactly for a costume or simply create an Elsa-inspired wardrobe using the same colour palettes.   The main outfit most people associate with Elsa is her "Snow Queen" dress. It is a glittery strapless dress that is light blue in colour. She accessorises with a sheer icy blue sleeved cape decorated with snowflakes over her dress and a pair of matching pale blue heels. Elsa's other main outfit is the one she wore for her coronation. It consists of a floor-length teal bodice dress over a black long-sleeved top with matching teal gloves and a regal purple-leaning magenta cape.A more recent and lesser-known look Elsa has sported is the one she had in the animated short Frozen Fever. It is very similar to her Snow Queen outfit but replaces the aqua blue tones with emerald greens. Instead of snowflakes, her cape is accented with leaves and pink flowers. This is a good choice if you want a more spring or summer-themed outfit whilst still looking like Elsa., Part of Elsa's distinct look is her makeup style. While bold, her makeup is relatively simple and can be done as part of your everyday routine.   Elsa wears quite heavy makeup around her eyes. She wears a solid lavender eyeshadow across her entire lid. She also creates an almost smoky look with black mascara and eyeliner. As an adult, Elsa always wears bright magenta lip colour. Elsa's eyebrows are a much darker shade compared to her icy hair. If you are a natural platinum blonde with equally light eyebrows, try darkening them using a honey or tan eyebrow pencil. While likely natural, Elsa has pale pink, rosy cheeks that you can match with a little bit of blush. Elsa's eyeshadow in Frozen Fever is more of a gentle pink or magenta, similar to her lipstick. Her makeup in the short film is lighter than it appears in Frozen, opposed to her sister Anna, who wore very little or no makeup in Frozen, and more than usual on her birthday in "Frozen Fever".  Like her hair, Elsa's skin is quite pale to match her icy magical powers. Try not to get too much sun and always remember to use sunscreen.  Remember that not everyone can have pale skin. If your skin is dark, don't use chemicals and substances to make it unnaturally pale. You and your costume will be just as beautiful.  While trying to keep her ice powers under control and a secret, Elsa's parents made her wear gloves.You can wear gloves, ideally, silky and thin ones to either pretend you're hiding magical powers of your own or simply copy Elsa's look from earlier on in the film. A pair of gloves will especially stand out if you pair them with warmer weather clothing.   Keep in mind that people may find you constantly wearing gloves to be a bit odd! Remember that Elsa gives up this practice once her secret is out.	Wear your hair like Elsa's. Dress like Elsa. Do your makeup like Elsa's. Aim for pale skin. Make a point of wearing gloves often.
These options are good for hanging pictures that are 20 pounds or less.          If you are using a nail and hammer: Select a 1 ½-inch (4d) or 2-inch (6d) nail. Place the nail in the center of the pencil marking that you made in the previous step. Drive the nail into the wall at a steep 45-degree angle. The 45-degree angle gives the nail much greater strength than simply driving it straight into the wall.If you are using a drill and screw: Drill a hole in the center of the pencil mark you made. Screw the screw into the hole.If you are using a traditional picture hook: Insert the nail through the sleeve on the hook. Hold the hook against the wall at the desired height (where you made the pencil mark) and tap the nail into the wall (the hook will hold the nail at a 45-degree angle automatically). Be carefully to only tap the nail and not the hook, as the hook could cut your wall., Heavier pictures call for more durable hanging devices. Choose between a spiral anchor or a toggle bolt.          If using a spiral anchor: This method is the easiest way to hang heavy pictures. Drive the spiral anchor into the wall with a screwdriver. Drive a screw into the anchor with a screwdriver. Some spiral anchors come with special picture hanging hooks.If using a toggle bolt: Drill a ½-inch hole into the wall. Align the metal channel along with the straps and slide the metal channel into the hole. Hold the ends of the straps with your thumb and forefinger. Pull them toward you until the channel rests flush against the backside of the wall. Slide the plastic cap along the straps until the cap is flush against the wall. Push the straps side to side and snap them off when they are level to the cap. Insert a bolt over the cap and insert the bolt. The package that the toggle bolt comes in will have specific instructions for your individual bolt.	Decide whether you are going to use a simple nail or screw, or a traditional picture hook. Decide what hanging implement you are going to use for pictures that are heavier than 20 pounds.
This is the best way to dry large, delicate flowers such as lilies, as long as the flower doesn't drop its petals too easily.Ideally, pick the flowers when they're about half open, and dry immediately.  A desiccant is an extra-absorbent material, that will slowly pull out water from your flowers. Whichever desiccant you choose must be completely dry to be effective. Here are the most common options:Silica gel: the fastest option, available at garden supply stores. Although more expensive, it can be reused many times (see Tips below). Borax and white cornmeal: a cheap and lightweight option. Mix in equal quantities, or with as little as 1 part borax to 6 parts cornmeal — it shouldn't make much difference.Fine sand: this just supports the shape of the flower, allowing the air to dry it. The slowest option, but sometimes the cheapest.  Some people suggest that salt helps the petals keep their color, although not everyone agrees.Try it with 3 tbsp salt per quart of other materials (15mL per L).  If you have plenty of material, pick a container that can fit the entire upright stem. Most people save on materials and just cut off the flower stem, leaving a blossom that can fit in a shallow container. Different materials require slightly different setups:For silica gel, use a container that can be sealed airtight. A coffee can is a good option for a single flower. For borax or sand, use an open container. A strong cardboard box is ideal, but check the base for holes first.  Pour your material into the container, to a depth of 1–2 inches (2.5–5cm). Place the flowers upright in the material, making sure they're stable. Sift or slowly pour more desiccant on top of them, until they are buried.   If using sand, you don't need to bury the flowers completely. The sand is mostly for support, and air exposure can help dry the petals. Flowers from the daisy family dry best upside-down instead.Some flowers, such as snapdragons and delphiniums, dry best when laid horizontal.If the stems are still attached, fill the container as deep as necessary to hold them.  Store the container in a warm, dry location. If using an open container, keep it in a room with good air flow. Check after a few days, using a toothpick to probe the petals and test for dryness.   Silica gel is the fastest means of drying flowers; most take only 2-4 days to dry completely, while thick flowers can take up to a week.When silica gel turns pink, it's absorbed as much moisture as it can. Borax mixtures can take 5–14 days to dry the flowers. Sand takes longest of all, usually about 14–21 days., Tip the container sideways and tap the sides until the flower is exposed. Gently remove the dry flower, supporting it from underneath. Brush away the packing material with a small brush.   If the material is clinging to the flower, pour a thin stream of sand from about 12 inch (30cm) above the flower. This should dislodge the stuck particles.Removing the flowers too soon can cause drooping. Test the edge first for a crisp, papery feel before you pick it up. Floral sealer or hairspray will postpone breakage.	Choose your flowers. Choose your desiccant. Add non-iodized salt (optional). Choose a container. Bury the flowers in the desiccant. Wait until dry. Remove carefully.
Try to keep the lines as straight as possible. You can use a ruler if you want.  It should be congruent and behind the first square you drew. You should now have two squares overlapping one another. The further they are apart, the longer your house will be. (For a relatively square house, the distance between the squares should be about a quarter of either square’s length.)  , Draw lines connecting the corners of each square. Make sure you connect each to the nearest corner, and that you then connect that to the other square. This will make your squares into a three-dimensional cube.  This will determine the point of the roof. It should be high in comparison to the house’s base, but not more than half its height.  They should all be attached to the dot by a smooth, straight line. This will be the roof.  All of your inner lines should be gone except for the line that differentiates the roof from the base of the house. (You can still erase it if you want, but it will be harder to tell where the house stops and the roof begins.)  , The windows should be small and square, and not too close to the walls’ edges. The door is a rectangle with a circle for a doorknob. If you want you can draw a window on the side of the house, but it needs to be a parallelogram, not a square.  Create details and make sure you shade correctly. It works best if you choose a bright color for the base of the house, and an equally bright color for the roof. Then take darker versions of these colors, and color in the other side with them; this will shade your drawing effectively.	Draw a square. Draw another square. Connect the corners. Draw a dot above the cube, in the “front” of the house. Connect the upper corners to the dot. Erase the dot and every inner line. Draw a door/windows. Color it in.
For talk radio shows, having a second (or third, or fourth...) person in the studio with you every show makes your job easier in just about every way imaginable. Most importantly, co-hosts offer their own unique personality and thoughts to every discussion you have, ensuring that your own voice and views don't get stale. It also allows you to have friendly debate — the back-and-forth between a pair of co-hosts who can lovingly bicker is often one of the most entertaining parts of a talk show. If you're thinking of getting a co-host, make sure it's someone you get along with and who understands the commitments of the job.   Co-hosts have other benefits, too. For instance, some may be willing to split the cost of airtime with you or help search for and book guests.  For the listener, some of the fun of listening to their favorite shows is from anticipating, listening to, and even participating in their favorite recurring features. As long as you obey the rules of your station (and, of course, local laws) there's virtually no limit when it comes to what sorts of segments you can run, so be creative! Below are just a few ideas to get you started:   Call-in trivia contests for prizes or recognition Live or pre-recorded man-on-the-street segments "100th caller wins" type contests Soliciting listeners for certain types of stories On-air creative comedy/improv exercises  , Just because your viewers are likely to appreciate the consistency of recurring segments doesn't mean that you should necessarily shy away from special one-time events and features. Experimenting with new ideas while keeping the basic format and structure of your show intact allows you to continually innovate and surprise your audience. It's also a good way to find new directions for the show to go in — anything that gets an especially good reaction can eventually be made a recurring segment.  If you notice that certain people seem to call in to the station on a regular basis or that certain guests seem especially popular with your listeners, don't let these people go to waste! Instead, try to create a friendly working relationship with them. Talk to these people off the air and ask if they'd like to become a regular part of the show. Even if they aren't interested in joining the show as a dedicated cast member, they may appreciate being made a "friend of the show" or gaining recognition as an official contributor.   For instance, if one of your callers has a boisterous, outrageous personality and insane political beliefs, you may want to have a semi-regular segment where he calls in and comments on the issues of the day.  Some talk radio shows, especially those that examine or critique serious topics, are dignified affairs. However, many talk shows are known for the exaggerated, crass, or outlandish characters assumed by their hosts. If your show is mainly interested in entertaining your listeners, consider creating such a character for yourself. The interplay between a crazy host character and a straightman co-host or an unwitting caller can make for great radio.  No one's radio show is perfect from the get-go. It can take years of experience to develop your broadcast craft to the point that you can deliver a great show every day. During this time, it's a great idea to look to some of the best radio shows and podcasts in the world for inspiration. There's no shame in getting ideas from those who are already successful — they, too, had role models in the world of broadcasting before they became famous (for instance, Howard Stern cites radio host Bob Grant as an influence).Below are a few great radio shows and podcasts you may want to consider listening to:    This American Life — Politics, serious issues, human interest stories  The Howard Stern Show — "Shock jock" style raunchy humor  The Ron and Fez Show — humor, chat  Car Talk (no longer running) — automotive advice  Comedy Bang Bang (podcast) — absurdist comedy, improv  The Bugle (podcast) — news, politics	Consider recruiting a co-host. Schedule regular features. Create memorable one-off segments. Build a relationship with frequent contributors. Create an on-air persona. When in doubt, learn from the greats.
In order to collect on a deficiency, you need to follow your state’s notice requirements. If you fail to follow the requirements, then you might not be able to sue for the deficiency.   To find your state’s law, you should go to your local law library, which should be at your courthouse. Ask the librarian to see your state’s law on car repossession and deficiency judgments. You can also search the Internet. Many states put their statutes on the web. Type “your state” and then “car repossession law” into your favorite web browser. Look for websites with .gov in the address. This signals that it is an official state website. State websites should have the most accurate information.; , Depending on your state law you will have to provide several written notices to the car owner. These notices typically include:notice of your right to redeem the car by paying the full loan amount and when you can redeem it notice of your right to reinstate the loan (pay the back payments) and when you can do it the amount of the deficiency balance, which includes any fees and charges the date of the sale, if you are selling at a private sale the location, date, and time of the auction, if you are selling by auction  , You also have to make sure that the borrower receives your notice. State law may require a certain form of delivery as well as deadlines for when notice must be given. Make sure to follow the law.   In Connecticut, for example, you must give at least 10 days’ written notice, which should be served personally or by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested.Regardless of what your state law requires, you should always send a copy of the notice certified mail, return receipt requested. The return receipt is your proof that the borrower received your notice.  You must also sell the car in a “commercially reasonable manner.”This standard is a little vague. Often, it means selling the car at a public auction. However, private sales can sometimes be commercially reasonable if you engage in fair and honest dealing. Make sure that you avoid doing the following, all of which are not “commercially reasonable”:Don't sell the car as junk without doing an appraisal Don't buy the vehicle back (after the sale) and then resell it for a higher price Don't sell the car in a private sale when most repossession sales in your area are conducted by public auction Don't refuse to advertise Don't sell to family, friends, or employees  , To sell the car properly, you should advertise.Preferably, you should advertise in a large newspaper or in a trade publication that has a large readership.In your advertisement, you need to include a proper description of the vehicle. Include the year, make, model, mileage, and general condition of the car (fair, good, excellent). You can sue the defendant for the costs of the advertisements. Hold onto your receipts from the newspaper or publication.  These sales are suspect. You should try to make an “arm’s length” sale to a stranger. If you sell to people you know, then the borrower could claim that you gave the purchaser a break on the price because of your relationship.  You should try to get a price as close to the resale value as possible. Look up the car’s value on Kelley Blue Book by visiting its website at www.kbb.com.   Once at the website, click on “Check My Car’s Value” on the left-hand column. Enter the year, make, model, and mileage of the vehicle. Then enter your zip code on the next screen. Select the car’s style and provide information about the car’s options. You will then be given two prices: if you were to trade in to a dealer or sell to a private party. Select “Sell to a Private Party.” You will then be provided with a price depending on whether your car is in fair, good, very good, or excellent condition.  Should the borrower try to redeem the car or reinstate the loan, then you must accept payment.You won’t be able to sue to collect the deficiency if you refuse to sell to the borrower.  You cannot sell or keep the borrower’s personal property. You should be sure to clear out the car before auction. Any personal property in the car when it is repossessed must be returned to the borrower.Personal property does not include things done to improve the car, such as the installation of a luggage rack or stereo.   Send a letter to the borrower stating where and when to pick up the personal property. You should safely store it so that it does not become damaged.  To sell in a commercially reasonable manner, you should use an experienced auctioneer who has worked in the auto resale market.In many cities and states, there are companies that hold public auctions as their business.To find them, type your city or state and “auto auction” in a web browser.   Also make sure that the minimum bid is not too low. That suggests that you are not interested in maximizing the amount from the sale. A court might not think the sale is commercially reasonable if you set the minimum bid too low. You should also let potential bidders inspect the car.  You will need proof of the sales price when you sue for the deficiency. Make sure to type up a sales contract and have the purchaser sign it. Make sure that you include the sale price in the contract.   For tips on how to write a simple contract, see Write a Legal Contract. If you choose not to sell the car but keep it, then you can’t sue for the deficiency., To successfully sue for the deficiency, you need to be the payee on the loan papers. You also must have been given a security interest in the car.Take out your loan papers and review them. Look to see that you have been listed as the payee and that you were granted a security interest. You should be identified as the payee near the top of the loan document. Look for “Security Interest” as a subject heading in the loan document. If you can’t find that you were granted a security interest, then meet with a lawyer to review your documents. Also make sure that the loan documents give you a right to sue for the deficiency. If not, then you probably cannot sue.  You can sue only for the deficiency. This is the amount of the loan minus the amount you recovered on the sale. You can also charge for certain costs and fees:costs associated with repossessing, storing, and selling the vehicle attorneys’ fees (if your state allows)  , An experienced attorney can help you bring the lawsuit. To find a lawyer, you can visit your state’s bar association, which should give you a referral.   Make sure that your lawyer has experience collecting deficiency judgments in court. Once you have the name of a referral, then you can call to schedule a consultation. When you call, check to see if the lawyer has experience in this area. For tips on how to find a competent attorney, see Find a Good Attorney.  Your state might require that you send a letter to the borrower after the sale. You should include information about how much the car was sold for and how much in costs and fees you incurred repossessing, storing, and selling the vehicle.   You also need to account for how the sale proceeds have been applied to the debt. Typically, you are allowed to apply the proceeds to your costs before applying proceeds to the balance of the loan.For example, assume that the loan balance is $10,000. You incurred an additional $500 in costs. You then sold the car for $7,500. Under this scenario, you first apply the proceeds to the costs: this leaves you with $7,000 in remaining sale proceeds. Then you apply those proceeds to the loan balance. In total, the deficiency is $3,000 ($10,000 minus $7,000).  You start a lawsuit by filing a complaint in court. The complaint states the factual circumstances of the lawsuit and states how much you are trying to recover from the borrower.   Your lawyer can draft the complaint for you. If you choose to proceed without a lawyer, then you should get a form complaint from the court clerk. This is a printed, “fill in the blank” form. Ask the court clerk if one is available. An example of a form complaint for Colorado is available at https://www.courts.state.co.us/Forms/PDF/c.r.c.c.p.21.pdf. If your state does not have a form complaint, you cannot use Colorado’s. However, you can use this as a guide as you type your own complaint. Attach a copy of any loan agreements to the complaint. In some states, you must attach a copy of any contract you are suing on., You should file your lawsuit in the county where the borrower lives or where the contract was signed. Make several copies of your complaint and take them to the court clerk. Tell the clerk you want to file. The clerk should date stamp all of the copies.   You will probably have to pay a filing fee. This will vary, depending on the court. Ask the court clerk how much the filing fee will be when you stop in to pick up a form complaint. If you can’t afford the filing fee, then ask for a fee waiver form and complete it.  You need to inform the borrower that you have sued for the deficiency. Accordingly, you need to serve a copy of the complaint and a summons on the defendant. The summons will tell the borrower when he or she must appear in court. You can get it from the clerk.Proper service varies depending on the court. In some courts, you can have the clerk mail a copy of the complaint and summons to the borrower. In other courts, you can have someone 18 or older make personal service, provided that they are not a party to the lawsuit. You may also have the sheriff or a private process server make service for a fee. The fee could cost $45-75, depending on where you live.To find a process server, check your phone book or search on the Internet. Ask the court clerk for what methods of service are acceptable and be sure to follow the rules. Your case can be thrown out of court if you do not make proper service.  The borrower will respond to your complaint by filing an Answer. In the Answer, the borrower will admit, deny, or claim insufficient knowledge to admit or deny each allegation made. The defendant will also provide any additional facts which are missing from the complaint.   The borrower will also raise affirmative defenses.In practice, the borrower will probably allege that you didn’t follow proper procedure. For example, the borrower might claim you didn’t give proper notice that he had the right to redeem the car. Alternately, the borrower could claim that you did not sell the car in a commercially reasonable manner.  You will need to show the judge that you did follow correct procedures for repossessing and selling the car. Gather the following:   the original loan contract any communications between you and the borrower receipts for all expenses incurred (repo, advertising, etc.) copies of the notice provided to the borrower a copy of your advertisements made the sale contract when you resold the car information about the auctioneer, including name and contact information a copy of the deficiency letter sent to the borrower  , If you are in small claims court, then the trial will be more informal than if you appeared in regular civil court.In small claims, you should expect the judge to look at your documents and to ask you questions.   Even if you appear in regular civil court, the trial should be fairly simple. The case will turn on whether the contract was validly executed and whether you provided proper notice and made a commercially reasonable sale. In regular civil court, you may have to select a jury and then make opening and closing statements to the judge. If you appear in regular civil court, you should have an attorney represent you. If you are representing yourself, then see Be Your Own Lawyer in Court.  If you lose at trial, you have the option of appealing. Ask the court clerk for the Notice of Appeal form and fill it out. Then file it with the clerk. You have only so much time to appeal, but you should not delay.   If you brought the case in small claims court, you might not have the right to appeal if you lose. You should consider this before choosing to proceed in small claims court.  You also might win the lawsuit. However, now you need to collect money from the defendant. There are many different methods that you can use to collect a judgment. For information on how to collect judgments, see Collect a Judgment.	Read your state law. Draft the notice. Serve the notice.

Fold a square scarf (silk preferably) diagonally to create a large triangle shape. Starting at the widest side of the triangle, roll        , Find a small scarf in a lightweight fabric (square silk scarves typically work best) and pull your hair into a ponytail with one of the corners of the scarf tucked into the loop. Section your hair into three pieces, and add the scarf to one of the strands. Braid your hair as you usually would, weaving the scarf into your hair as you go. Knot off the end with an elastic band and wrap the scarf around it, and tuck the end in place.  This style is best for adorning updos and when your hair is pulled back from your face. Style your hair as you would normally, and then wrap a small, thin scarf around the elastic band or hair clip that you've used to pin your hair up. Tie the scarf in a bow, and adjust the fabric as necessary to make it more attractive.  Take a large square scarf and fold it in half diagonally to create a large triangle. Drape this over your head so that the widest side of the triangle is above your forehead, and the two tail ends are near the nape of your neck. Tie the tail ends in a knot or a bow underneath your hair at the base of your neck. This style is great for bad hair days, or when you need to keep your hair out of your face.	Turn your scarf into a headband. Braid a scarf into your hair. Tie a scarf in a bow in your hair. Wear your scarf as a bandanna.
The best way to use mirrors in decorating is to use them to create depth. Place them in smaller or narrower rooms to make the room seem larger.; , Reflecting light is another great way to use mirrors in decorating. Place them opposite of a window, especially in rooms that have only one window, to double the amount of light in a room.  If you have a large space to fill and you don't want to spend a fortune on a big mirror, you can also use multiple small mirrors to fill the space instead. Get mirrors in matching styles and hang them collage-style.   If the mirror frames don't match color-wise, you can paint them to all have the same frame color, creating a united look.  Your mirror placement should also take practicality into account. Placing a mirror near, for example, the front door is more useful than in a room like an office.  Too many mirrors in a home and you'll be venturing dangerously into 1970s decorating territory. A good rule of thumb is 2 mirrors per level on your house (not counting your bathroom).  Studs are the wooden frame pieces which act as the structural support for a wall. If you're not anchoring your mirror in your studs, reconsider. If you put a nail in something that's not a stud, even if you use something like a screw anchor to add support, you run the risk of driving a nail into something you don't want to hit, such as a pipe or electrical wire.  The stud is part of the inner frame of the wall and is usually needed to hang items that are on the heavier side. The easiest way to find the stud, of course, is to use an electronic device specifically for this purpose. You can purchase them from just about any hardware store and they range from $10-40 (USD) in cost.   There are stud finders that use a magnet to locate the stud based on nails that may be in the wall and stud finders that work by testing the density of the wall. The magnetic stud finders are usually cheaper but might not work as well.  If you don't want to use a stud finder, you can locate a stud by using your ears. Knock on your wall with your fist. If the wall is made using modern methods (built after ~1950), you should hear a hollow, deeper, longer echo when you knock on an empty part of the wall and a short, higher-pitched sound when you knock on a stud.  There are other indicators of a stud if the knocking method isn't working or you want to double check for the stud location.Look for outlets. Outlets will be built into a box which is anchored on a stud. If you find an outlet, the edge of the stud is probably within 2" from the edge of plate. Look for windows. Windows are also built between studs, so a window can similarly indicate a stud. Look for molding nails. Molding and trim is usually nailed into a stud, so you can check your molding for nail placement.  In most modern construction, studs are 16" from center to center. In older homes (built roughly before 1950 or so) the studs are placed 24" or less apart. If you find one stud, it will make it much easier to find another.   Studs are also located in the corners of rooms. Another way to find a stud would be to measure from said corner.  Once you think you've found a stud, test to be sure by hammering a nail into the spot in question. If it goes in like a knife cutting through butter, you missed the stud. If, however, it gets more and more difficult to get it to go in, you found a stud.  An extra hand (and eye) can be handy during this part of the process. Get a friend to help you!  , Will the mirror need a hook? A peg? One or two? You'll need to know in order to plan where you will place the anchor points., Trace the mirror onto a large piece of cardboard. You can then place tape on the cardboard and place it on the wall, moving it as necessary and even testing it out in different locations. Use a level to get it straight and then mark the location on the wall with a pencil., Place the mirror on the wall at roughly the height you'd like it to be at and then mark the upper or lower edge with a pencil. Next, use a level and a measuring tape to make sure that the bottom guide line is straight. Measure the height of the mirror and then mark the upper guide line using that measurement.  The old adage holds true: it's better to be extra, super sure that everything is correctly measured and prepared than have your mirror come crashing down on your feet.  There are a number of commercial adhesives which work well for hanging this type of mirror. Command adhesive strips are the most popular brand in the US and work well. Make sure that whatever strips you buy are appropriate for the weight you want to support.  Place the adhesives on the back of the mirror as listed in the instructions for your product. You should have roughly one strip to each corner.  Place the mirror where you want it to go. You'll essentially only have one chance, so this is a good reason to outline your mirror location on your wall if possible.  With Command and similar strips, they can usually be removed without leaving a mark on the wall, so don't worry if you have to remove the mirror in the future. Just be careful to attach and remove them correctly.  With heavy mirrors, it's a really good idea to have at least one contact point in a stud. Try to be sure that you place your mirror so that it can hang from at least one stud.  Place a strip of painter's tape on the back of your mirror going just over or just under the hanging hardware. Mark on the tape the spots where the mirror will hang from. This will give you the distance between your two wall contact points.   Most heavy mirrors come with hardware attached at the back for hanging. If they don't, however, use the steps in Method 4 to attach a picture wire.  Measure the distance from the top of the mirror down to where the attachment hardware is. Then, mark this distance on your wall down from the line you made for where you would like the upper edge of your mirror to be.  Place the painter's tape on your wall, so that the marks are level with the hang height you found in the previous step. This will show you where to place your nail or screw. Mark this location with a marker or leave the tape in place. Just be sure that it is level.  The contact points, in this case a nail or screw, will need to be placed securely in your wall. You will definitely want at least 2 points, more if your mirror is very wide. Insert a screw into a stud at the location you found, or, if you must install a contact point where there is no stud, place an anchor and then the included screw.  Once you have your wall contact point or points in place, hang your mirror, being careful not to let the mirror go until you're sure it's firmly in place and the hooks are able to support the weight.  If the mirror is heavy, you'll want to try to get your wall contact points anchored in a stud. Since the brackets that will support this type of mirror don't need to be anywhere to specific underneath the mirror, this is not as hard as it might sound.  For the bottom, you'll want to get 2 J brackets, with a cradle wide enough for the thickness of your mirror. For the top, you'll want to sliding J brackets, which are J brackets that come with a separate piece that they slide and lock into.  Install the lower brackets into the stud, at the line you measured in the section on lining up your mirror. They should preferably come at least 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) in from the outside corners. If you cannot install them into a stud, be sure to use an anchor.  Install the upper bracket holder according to the manufacturer's instructions. Make sure that it is not too high. Place the J bracket just inside the holder, making sure not to lock it into a lower position.  Slide your mirror into place. If it is heavy, get help.  Lower the upper bracket until it holds the mirror securely in place.  Attach D-rings or loops to the back of the mirror at two places so that they point towards where the mirror will be hanging from. A wire will go between the rings to hang the mirror on.  Get a picture wire from your local hardware shop. Thread the wire between the rings then twist the end several times to create a strong connection.   Make it long enough to go between the two D rings and reach the place where the mirror should hang at. You will also need to leave some extra to wrap and attach to the rings.  If the mirror is light, one hook should be enough. If it is heavy, you will need two. If placing two, try to place them around 4-8" apart (depending on the width of the mirror). They should leave room for the mirror to hang, not being so high that you can see the wire once it's up or so low that the mirror is difficult to adjust or won't hang at all.   If your contact points are on a stud, a nail, screw or hook can go straight in and no other pieces of hardware are necessary. If your contact points are not on a stud, you will need to use anchors or thick-threaded screws (anchors are preferable). Install the anchors and then hang the mirror from the included screw.  Once you have your wall contact point or points and hanging wire in place, hang your mirror, being careful not to let the mirror go until you're sure it's firmly in place and the hooks are able to support the weight.

Make sure the title has been filled out correctly before completing the purchase. Verify the mileage, as filled out on the title. The form needs to include:   names of buyer and seller date of sale odometer number VIN number any other information necessary to the sale of the car  , A lien is a legal interest in a piece of property. Typically, you grant a lien to another party to secure a debt. However, sometimes people can get a court to grant them a lien in a car.   Most liens are held by the bank that gave the seller their car loan. The car is used as collateral for the loan. In that situation, the bank probably has held onto the title and the only way the seller can get the title is to pay off the lien. However, a seller could have other liens on the car. Accordingly, don’t assume that there are no liens on the car simply because the seller has title. For example, a child support lien might have been placed on the car. Alternately, a mechanic could get a lien on the car for unpaid repairs. If you buy the vehicle with the lien on it, you now become responsible for the lien.If you have the VIN, you can check for liens at your DMV. This is a critical step, so don’t neglect it.  Your state probably also requires that you sign the back of the title along with the seller.You should sign only after you have verified the information on the title and checked for liens.   Ideally, you should go with the seller to the DMV office and fill out the transfer form together there. Even if not required by the state, going together can protect you because you can check for liens while you are there.The DMV should also have a notary public in the office, in case your state requires that your signatures be notarized.  You’ll need certain information to have the vehicle transferred into your name. Contact the DMV and ask what you will need. Generally, you’ll need the Bill of Sale showing the purchase price and the signed title.You’ll also need the VIN and current odometer reading, which should be on the title form. In some states, the odometer reading will be written on a different form.  Take the completed title and visit your local DMV office. You will need to complete paperwork at the office to transfer the title to you.You can call ahead of time to ask what information you need.   You typically must pay a fee for the title transfer, which will vary by state. You must turn over the title. Your state should send you a new title in the mail.  You can typically register your car when you transfer the title, usually at the DMV. To register, you’ll need the following documents:proof of insurance proof that you’ve paid sales tax certificates showing the car has passed safety and emissions inspections	Verify the information on the title. Confirm the vehicle does not have liens. Sign the title. Gather required documents. Apply for a new title at the DMV. Register your car.
Start by soaking the metal in bleach to kill the mildew and remove discoloration. Make a solution of water and bleach in a 3:1 ratio. Let the metal soak in the solution for approximately 20 minutes. Rinse your metal with plain water after you've finished. If the metal is new or free from any mildew, you can proceed without soaking the object in bleach., Rough up the surface with a wire brush. You can also use an electric sander with coarse sandpaper, a power drill, or a rotary tool to remove all debris. Choose a grit between 36 and 100 to remove rust and smooth flaws.Wear eye protection and a dust mask to avoid getting metal fragments in your eyes or lungs. Use a pair of work gloves to avoid injuries. For large objects, you can remove rust, debris, and old paint with a liquid commercial rust remover.  Mineral spirits are a type of turpentine-free paint thinner. Wipe the metal down with a rag dampened with mineral spirits. Remove any dust and debris that may be left behind from sanding. Make sure the surface is completely clean and dry so that the primer will stick to the object.   Keep in mind that mineral spirits will strip any existing fresh paint. Also remember that mineral spirits will only strip away paint that is still fresh. If you want to remove existing paint that won't come off with mineral spirits, try cleaning your metal with turpentine instead., Spray the primer on the surface in a smooth, even layer. You should coat the metal with primer as soon as the surface has been prepared to avoid dirt or rust accumulating on the surface again.Choose a primer specifically recommended for the type of metal you are painting.   Choose a spray primer in the same color as the finish when possible. Try to purchase a primer in the same brand as the paint you will buy, as colors are more likely to be better matched and chemically compatible. Purchase primer that is rust resistant. Priming with a paint brush is very difficult to do without leaving streaks. Use a spray primer for best results. Read the directions on the product to determine the necessary time for the primer to dry.  Be sure to shake the can first. Hold down the nozzle and coat the desired areas. Use masking tape or painter's tape to cover any areas you want to avoid painting. Hold the can approximately a foot away from the object. Start spraying off to the side of the object and move the can with a continuous motion across the metal object without pausing. Allow paint to dry.   Control your environment. If you are painting a smaller object, you can place it in a cardboard box and apply your paint. If you pause while spraying, you may notice a splotch appear. Use a cloth to wipe away the wet paint immediately before it can dry. Allow the remaining paint to dry before starting again. Galvanized metals have a thin layer of zinc chromate. The biggest reason for paint chipping or not adhering to galvanized metal is that the paint bonds to the zinc coating, or the residue collected on the surface, rather than the metal itself.If you have a piece of galvanized metal, look for a paint that doesn't contain any alkyds,as these oil-based binders can react with the zinc coating.  Once the first coat of paint has dried, you will want to apply a second coat of paint to the surface. Adding a second coat of paint will increase the life of your paint job. Allow the paint to dry.   To get the best results, always wait 24 hours between applying coats of paint.	Treat any mildew. Remove any rust. Clean the metal object with mineral spirits. Apply a coat of primer. Apply an even coat of paint. Apply a second coat of paint.
There’s no need to venture all the way to the Alaskan frontier or remote outposts of the Rockies in order to find good looking accoutrements. The rustic look is in, so it shouldn’t be hard to track down a few things that suit your preferences at major home goods stores. You’ll have the most luck when shopping for bigger items like tables, chairs and bedding in these places.   Chain stores like Crate and Barrel, Hobby Lobby and Pottery Barn specialize in rustic home decor.Furniture outlets tend to charge more, so if you don’t like the idea of paying as much, thrift stores and DIY distressing techniques may be the way to go.  It’s not uncommon to stumble upon forgotten treasures at secondhand stores and vintage boutiques. These are often items that you can’t find anywhere else, and you’re guaranteed a good deal. If you’re remodeling on a budget or looking for one-of-a-kind pieces, a thrift store may be your best bet.Many old pieces will be ready to display in your home as-is. Be sure to check beck regularly, as store inventories change constantly.  Rather than scouring various stores and shops for wares with the right rustic vibe, buy furniture and accessories new and modify them yourself at home. Distressing furniture is fast, fun and could hardly be easier. All you need are a few basic tools like paint thinner, sandpaper and specialty paints and brushes. When you’re finished, you’ll have a collection of items that are truly one-of-a-kind.Painted wood furniture can be weathered to expose the beautiful grain underneath, and metal objects can be strategically rusted or painted over with a matte finish.Change out the hardware on any dressers or cabinets you happen to come across to customize their appearance.  For those little extra touches, look no further than your own attic or garage. Most homes are loaded with scraps of materials that are infinitely useful if applied correctly. For instance, you could use a roll of butcher’s twine to wrap drawer pulls and cabinet handles, wire lanterns for indoor lighting or frame an assortment of old fishing hooks to make wall art that’s anything but commonplace. With a few innovative ideas, you’ll start seeing your junk drawer in a whole new light!If you have a certain item that you want to use but it doesn’t quite go with the rest of your furnishings, try painting, sanding or distressing it to make it a better visual fit.Get creative! As your own personal interior decorator, you’re only limited by the scope of your imagination.	Visit your local furniture store. Go thrift shopping. Distress plain pieces. Repurpose old items.
You can use a metal file to distress certain pieces of the guitar. Be selective of which components you file onto. Never attempt to scratch or directly impact the pick ups. Don’t use too much pressure to avoid appearing obvious.   Apply this to the tuning pegs, bridge, or input jack.  You can leave some of the metal parts outdoors to subject them to the forces of nature. This could cause rusting which is a popular aspect of a reliced guitar. Leave the metal parts outside for one to two days. Inspect the parts before using a different technique.   Again don’t leave the pickups or other electrical components of the guitar outdoors., You don’t need to search too hard to find a chemical that will create an aged effect on the metals. You can use a household bathroom cleaner. Use either a cleaner with bleach or ammonia, but never combine bleach and ammonia. Dip the pieces of metal into a bucket filled three parts water to one part bathroom cleaner.Let the components sit for about three hours and check on their condition. Repeat as many times until you reach the desired look. Some people will leave them soaking for up to 11 hours.  This is an optional step since the sound of your guitar is at stake. You can only age your pickups if you have metal humbuckers (silver or gold) or you have single coil pickups. You’ll first need to remove the casing so you don’t damage the literal pickup. This will vary depending on what pickup you have.   For steel casing you will use muriatic acid. This is a bit of an intense finish so you’ll need to wear rubber gloves and use precaution to cover your mouth and eyes. Apply the solution to a cloth and spread a thin layer over the case. Wait about ten minutes for the case to dry. If you want to age the pick ups more, then repeat the process. The aim is to not age it too much. For single coil pick ups, you can get away with soaking the casing in coffee for a aged look. Let the case soak for about thirty minutes and then let it dry completely before using again. Repeat if you didn’t reach the desired hue.	Create scratches on the metal manually. Let nature do the damage. Use chemicals. Age your pickups.
Look for a product labeled as “orange polish” or “orange cleaner.” It may or may not have an actual orange tint or color. You can usually apply this polish directly to the cabinets without diluting it, however, be sure to check on the packaging. This can be a more expensive option as a bottle can cost around $12.You can also make your own citrus-based cleaner by mixing ¼ cup (60 mL) of white vinegar in with 10 drops of orange essential oil.Murphy’s Oil Soap is one popular citrus cleaner that many people trust. It is considered a mild cleaner with a relatively light scent.; , If you have numerous areas with difficult stains, you may want to make your own scrub. Get out a bowl and mix together 2 parts baking soda for every 1 part vegetable or olive oil. You can use a finger or a spoon to get this into a chunky, thick paste. Then, apply it directly to the cabinets.You can also follow this method with one of the lighter cleaning options. This should leave your cabinets with no extra residue., In a large bowl or bucket, add 8 cups (1.92 liters) of water and 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of liquid soap. You can also put in a few drops of citrus essential oil, if you like. Mix it all together and apply it to the cabinets with a sponge. This is a gentle cleaner that will do a good job removing general dust.If you are looking for something a bit more powerful, try substituting the liquid soap with laundry detergent., In a large spray bottle, mix together 4 tablespoons of white distilled vinegar and 2 tablespoons of vegetable or olive oil. Fill the bottle to the brim with warm water and shake to mix everything together. Spray the solution lightly directly onto the cabinets.Using vinegar also has the added benefit of sanitizing your cabinets and removing germs during the cleaning process., If you notice a liquid spill that is running down from the counter and onto the cabinets, get a paper towel or washcloth and wipe it up right away. Get in the habit of doing this while you are cooking or just working in your kitchen. This will help to prevent your cabinets from getting discolored due to continued contact with food, such as spaghetti sauce., If you plan to work with many cabinets at once, it is a good idea to buy a large, plastic leaning bucket. You can stir your warm water and cleaning agent together in the bucket. Then, you can move the bucket from area to area as you work.After you finish each cleaning session, make sure to rinse your bucket out with warm tap water and set it upside down on a towel to dry.  Find a place on your cabinet that is not easily noticeable. Apply a standard amount of your cleaning solution to this area. Watch to see if any discoloration or waxing takes place. This will let you know if this particular cleaner is safe to use on the rest of your cabinets. You may need to wait up until 30 minutes to check the results., If you notice any areas of your cabinet that appear particularly dirty or discolored, you may want to place a bit of your cleaner on a toothbrush. Then, use this brush to lightly go over the surface of the problem spot. Keep applying consistent pressure until you start to see results. You may need to rinse off the area and reapply solution numerous times.Set this toothbrush aside and use it only for cabinet cleaning purposes.  For the remainder of your cabinets, you can dip a sponge into the bucket, let it soak up the solution, and then wring it out until it is just damp. Wipe the sponge over the surface of your cabinets until they are damp as well. Try to apply pressure to the crevices of the cabinets without creating dripping.You can also use a microfiber towel for both applying the liquid and for drying. After the cabinets are damp, let them sit and absorb the solution for a couple of minutes. You can also use this time to go over any problem areas once more., Whenever you wipe with a sponge or cloth, make sure to go with the grain, not against it. This will keep the wood looking smooth and not overly grainy. It is also a good idea to wipe in gentle circular motions. Trying to create some overlap at the edges of each stroke., After the solution has absorbed for a moment, refill your bucket with just warm tap water. Get a fresh cloth or sponge and wipe down the cabinets once more. This will remove any lingering cleaning agent and should leave your cabinets looking clean and fresh. Keep wiping until the cabinets feel dry to the touch., In addition to spot cleaning, designated a day each month where you do a full cleaning of your cabinets. This will help to reduce the build-up of dirt and grime. You will also get faster at this routine and should be able to complete it in minutes after a few sessions., If you have multiple layers of cabinets, or even with a single cabinet, it is a good idea to start from the top and work your way down. Apply the liquid cleaner at the top edges and make wiping circles across. This will let you wipe up any excess that accumulates that bottom of the cabinet., Traditional cabinet cleaners will often smear when placed on glass surfaces. To clean these areas, get an ammonia-free glass cleaner and apply with a fresh paper towel or another microfiber cloth. Place the cleaner on the cloth and then rub the surface. This will keep moisture from pooling behind the glass., These are the areas that are touched the most. They will likely be covered with fingerprints and smears. Use a microfiber cloth to gently polish these candles by applying a bit of cleaning solution. Keep going until they are restored to their original appearance., Don’t forget the inside of your cabinets. These spaces are likely to accumulate dust bunnies and food crumbs. Take a moment and use a paper towel or cloth moistened with warm water to wipe out the interiors. Start at the back of the cabinet drawers and shelves and move forward.Installing shelf paper to your cabinet interiors can also help to protect the wood and improve overall cleanliness.	Use a citrus-based cleaner. Make a baking soda scrub. Make a soap-based cleaner. Make a vinegar-based light solution. Clean up spills immediately. Mix the cleaning solution in a bucket. Do a test spot. Spot treat bad areas. Apply with a sponge. Wipe with the grain. Complete a final water rinse. Stick to a monthly cleaning schedule. Start at the top. Take care with glass inserts. Spend time on the handles. Wipe down cabinet drawers.
Pansies are generally a low-growing plant and fairly compact. However, if they are grown in the shade, they are more likely to grow tall and become a bit ‘leggy’. If your pansies are too ‘leggy’ they can look straggly and flop over, which generally doesn’t look as good, particularly if the flowers become hidden.   Your pansy plant can also become leggy if they are fed too often, so try to stick to monthly fertilizing treatments.  To deal with a leggy pansy stem, consider the length you would prefer the stem to be. Once you’ve determined the length you would like, find the nearest leaf set to your desired length. Cut back to about a quarter of an inch above the leaf set.   For most pansy varieties you can aim to cut the leggy parts of the plant back to about four inches of stem length (or the leaf set closest to this height).  If the whole plant is leggy, you may want to cut the whole stem back to a stem length of about four inches. Try to make the cut just above the leaf set closest to this four-inch length.   When the plant grows back, it should grow back more compactly.	Understand why a pansy might become too ‘leggy’. Determine how long you would like your pansy stems to be. Consider cutting back the whole ‘leggy’ plant.
Whitewashing is best suited to a soft wood like pine.A wood like oak will require pickling, a technique of whitening wood. Pickling is considered a method, not a finish, and though you can pickle pine and other soft woods, woods like oak and ash are the most common type of wood you can pickle. You can create your own pickling stain for oak and ash wood, or you can purchase pre made pickling stains.; , Taking off the doors will make them easier to whitewash and give you easier access to the cabinet frames. It's also a good idea to work on the cabinetry and the doors separately.   Use a drill to remove the doors. When you store the screws, label them so you can tell which door they came from. As the hardware is already set to a particular door, labelling the screws will prevent any confusion later when putting the doors back on., Before you start treating the wood, use rags and a heavy duty degreaser to clean the doors. Apply the degreaser to the front and the back of each cabinet as well as to the frames. Wipe down and repeat these steps as necessary until the cabinet and frame are very clean., Whitewashing requires a blank canvas for the wood stain to take. Paint strippers will do the job, but these harsh chemicals require excellent ventilation (or a respirator), safety goggles, neoprene/latex gloves, and a drop cloth to protect your floor.Apply one coat of paint stripper with steel wool, then wipe with a rag once the finish has dissolved. Most paint strippers are flammable, so dispose of the steel wool and rag in a sealed metal bucket.   Alternatives:Furniture re-finisher: This more mild product may work if there are only one or two previous coats on the cabinet.Other paint strippers: if yours is ineffective, try a more powerful option. From weakest to harshest, these are varnish, lacquer, paint, and polyurethane removers., You can sand the surface by hand or by using a power sander. The goal is to uncover the natural color of the wood cabinets. When sanding, always move in the direction of the wood grain, rather than against it.   Sanding by hand: fold a quarter of a sheet of 120 grit sandpaper into thirds to make a pad that fits your palm. Wrap it around a block of wood to get a sharper edge to work into bevels and corners.Sheet sander: cheap power tool, sand in stages to 180 grit to avoid marks.Random orbital sander: fast and powerful, but requires purchasing more expensive sanding disks. Sand to 120 grit, and be careful not to nick cabinet edges., If your cabinets are made of a soft wood like pine, it's important to condition them as these woods can sometimes appear blotchy when stained. Conditioning also raises the grain of the wood. You can use a pre-stain conditioner for this step.   Apply the conditioner to the cabinets with a clean brush designed for latex paints and then let them sit for 30 minutes. Follow up with a light sanding of the cabinets using the 120 grit paper again. This final sanding will ensure the cabinets have a smooth surface to absorb the stain.Dewaxed shellac is an alternative option, if heavily diluted and wiped off fairly quickly. This is a risky method, so experiment on scrap lumber first. Alternatively, apply dewaxed shellac to the end grain to prevent over-staining that area. Wipe off unabsorbed excess, then sand lightly., Different stains will create warmer or darker tones to the cabinets, so consider your preferred tone and choose a wood stain that will work well in your home. Brands such as Minwax have a variety of different wood stains to choose from.Water-based wood stains produce fewer fumes, dry fast and clean-up easier than oil-based wood stains, but the color may fade quicker. Only use oil-based stains in a well-ventilated area.  Whenever you are applying stains of any type, it's a good idea to test the stain on a sample of scrap wood of the same wood-type as the piece you'll be working on.   Shake the can of stain thoroughly before you open the can and test the stain. This will mix in any pigments that have settled at the bottom of the can. Apply the stain to the scrap wood with a paintbrush and let it set for 2 to 3 minutes. Ensure you are happy with the results before moving on to the next step.  Using a clean rag, apply the stain with long, smooth strokes in the same direction and work the stain into the wood. Follow the line of the grain while accentuating any knots in the wood. Wipe away excess stain with another clean rag or a soft cotton cloth that you've folded into a pad. The more pressure you apply to the rag or the pad, the more the wood grain will show through the stain on the final product.If you are pickling oak cabinets, apply the pickling stain with a brush and wipe the stain against the grain. Due to the large pores and the natural grain pattern of oak, wiping against the grain is essential to working the stain down into the pores of the wood. Once you've worked the pickling stain into the pores of the wood, use a clean rag to wipe away any excess.If your rag becomes tacky as you are staining the cabinets, replace it with a clean rag., This should take about 1 to 2 days. If the surface is tacky to the touch, the wood stain is not completely set and will need more drying time.  While whitewashing enhances the wood grain, it does not offer any wood protection. To finish the cabinets, use non-yellowing protective top coat that will penetrate the wood's pours and protect the wood from within, such as a water-based lacquer, clear acrylic or natural Tung oil.   Apply the top coat with a high quality brush that is designed for latex or water-based products, so that stray bristles don't end up on your top coat. Use overlapping continuous strokes to finish the surface, a process called "striking off." Allow the first coat to dry for about 4 hours, and then lightly sand the cabinets one last time with 220 grit sandpaper. Use a tack cloth to wipe away any excess reside left behind by the sandpaper, and then apply a second and final coat to the cabinets.When you finish the bottom of the cabinet, place the cabinet on a small block or shims so that the polyacrylic doesn't stick to the surface of your work area. Avoid using oil-based protective finishes over whitewashing or pickling as these finishes have a yellowish look that will detract from the white coloring of the whitewash look., Hang the cabinets back in their exact positions, using the labelled screws and hardware.	Determine what type of wood your cabinets are made of. Detach the cabinet doors. Clean the doors. Strip the old stain from the doors. Sand the cabinets. Condition the wood. Choose a whitewash wood stain. Test the stain before you use it. Apply the stain to the cabinets. Let the cabinets dry completely. Finish the cabinets with a top coat. Re install your whitewash cabinets.
Having a check valve will make sure that the water lingering in the sump pump’s discharge line does not flow back into the basin of the sump pump after you shut the pump off.  Make sure that you have everything you will need throughout the entire process to be better prepared. You will need the following:  Tape measure Pipe cleaner PVC cement PVC cement applicator Utility knife Sump pump check valve Adapters or couplings Pipe cutter  , Pay attention to the diameter of your existing discharge pipe. You can go to the local hardware store and buy the corresponding check valve (which comes with the correct diameter). It is important that you do not buy a valve with a smaller diameter than your current drainpipe.,  If you are going to a hardware store, it is a good idea to bring a sample of your pipe with you if possible. This allows you to try to fit the valves with your pipe, just to be sure that you have a good fit. Because there are so many different valves available, you can opt for whatever suits your needs., You also need to make sure that you buy the adapters or couplings that are going to fit according to the size of your drainpipe. Again, if you are unsure, having the pipe with you at the store is going to eliminate a lot of the confusion., You also need to make sure that you buy the adapters or couplings that are going to fit according to the size of your drainpipe. Again, if you are unsure, having the pipe with you at the store is going to eliminate a lot of the confusion., Just to be sure, before you ever get started, you should turn off the electricity to the pump. If you want to be extra cautious, make sure that you unplug the sump pump altogether., Now you have your sump pump check valve. The next step is looking at the discharge pipe and figuring out where exactly you should place your check valve. The traditional option is to have it close to the sump pump itself, next to the sump pit. This is going to ensure that you do not have too much water trapped between the pump and the check valve., Use a pipe cutter to cut the discharge pipe in two places. This is going to ensure that there is enough room to fit your new valve. You want to make sure that you do not cut too much of the pipe right away. Instead, measure first and then cut little by little. It is better to have to cut the pipe two or three times than realize that you took out too much., After you have made the cut the right way and you are happy with the result, you can smooth out the edges of the pipe. You want to file down the edges of the pipe as much as possible in order to smooth them out., You have a gap in your discharge pipe, now you want to fit the check valve into the recently created gap. If you were secure in determining the appropriate size at the start and with your cutting of the pipe, you should find that the valve actually fits perfectly., Both ends of the discharge pipe go into both ends of the valve. Now all you have left to do is secure it. Join all the ends together by using the couplings., If you have your sump pump check valve in place, you will now want to seal the points of contact. Use some PVC cement to create a good seal. Grab an applicator, put some cement on the applicator, and apply the cement across the gaps between the connections., Before you try your sump pump check valve make sure that you thoroughly clean the area. There should be no more open gaps., Now we have arrived at the final test, actually running your valve for the first time. In order to test your check valve, you have to open the pump and pump in some water from the sump pit. Pay close attention and listen carefully when the initial water pressure runs through the valve. You should be able to hear the flap inside of the valve open as the water pressure increases.	Understand why installing a sump pump check valve matters.The installation of a sump pump check valve is vital to the functioning of the entire system. Make sure you have what you need. You need to have the right tools for the job. Bring a sample of your pipe. Buy the right couplings. Drain the basin. Turning off the sump pump. Locate the discharge pipe. Cut the pipe. File the edges. Fit the valve. Fit both ends together. Seal the points of contact. Let the cement dry. Test your sump pump check valve.
This is the lowest note playable and it is designated A0 (the A at the zeroth octave).  The keys you'll encounter are detailed as follows:          First (left-most or lowest) white key is: A0 2nd white key is: B0 3rd white key is: C1  , Notice and repeat the following pattern for the remainder of the white keys, starting at the third white key:          3rd white key is: C1 4th white key is: D1 5th white key is: E1 6th white key is: F1 7th white key is: G1 8th white key is: A1 9th white key is: B1 10th white key is: C2 Notice how, after reaching B1, the pattern will repeat again for the next higher octave: C2. This pattern continues up the keyboard: C2 to C3, C3 to C4, and so on.  Starting at the lowest black note on the keyboard—at the leftmost side—the first black key is A♯0 or B♭0.          The symbol ♯ is read as sharp', and the symbol ♭ is read as flat.  3rd black key is D♯1 or E♭1. 4th black key is F♯1 or G♭1. 5th black key is G♯1 or A♭1. 6th black key is A♯1 or B♭1. As with the white keys, the black keys continue the same pattern up the keyboard.	Start at the first key to the left. Go up (to the right) the keyboard using only the white keys. Follow the pattern. Learn the black keys. Move up (to the right) in the keyboard, you'll find the following group of 5 black keys immediately after the first black key:          2nd black key is C♯1 or D♭1.
The rough/coarse side should be facing up.  You just need to get it in a size good enough to put on a dop-stick.  Be patient! This bit will take a while.  Then place your stone into the hot wax (make sure your fingers are wet to prevent the hot wax from sticking and burning you). Turn off your heat source., Put the sandpaper on top of your hand towel to give it cushioning. Rub the stone on sandpaper from 400 grit to 1200 grit., Wet it., This is the final phase/polishing.	Place the knife sharpening block onto a hard surface. Spray some water onto the block and start rubbing the opal across the surface to form an approximate shape. Heat the wax on the dop-stick. Rub the opal on sandpaper of different coarseness. Pour some cerium oxide onto the leather. Rub the opal-on-the-dop-stick on the cerium oxide paste.
The lap steel conversion is easiest to perform if the strings are removed from your guitar. This will allow you to adjust both the bridge saddles and the nut more easily, which will help you to raise the height of the strings above the fretboard.; , The saddles on a guitar's bridge are the 6 individual grooves over which the strings pass. They can usually be adjusted either using a flat head screwdriver or an allen wrench. Adjust them until they are as high above the guitar's body as they will go.  The strings will also need to be raised at the other end of the neck - namely, at the nut. To do this without costly and permanent modification, you'll need a specialized product called a slide guitar nut or a slide guitar extension nut. This simple metal nut can be easily fitted over the top of your existing nut, where it will be held in place by the pressure from the strings.  Once you have adjusted both the bridge and nut, you can restring your guitar. Note that lap steel guitars are typically strung with heavy gauge strings, which allow for a beefier, more sustained tone when played with a slide.  When tuning the strings, forgo the standard E tuning for an open tuning. Open tunings are a necessity on slide guitar, as they allow you to play a wider variety of intervals without needing to fret individual strings (which you can no longer do). Perhaps the most popular tuning for playing lap steel guitar is (from low to high) D-B-G-D-B-E.  To play your new lap steel guitar in the traditional manner, lay the body of the guitar flat across your lap with the fretboard facing the ceiling. Use a slide on the fretboard and pick the strings either with your fingers or with a combination of thumb and finger picks.	Remove the strings from your guitar. Adjust the bridge saddles as high as possible. Install a slide guitar nut over your guitar's existing nut. Restring your guitar with heavy gauge strings. Tune the guitar to an open tuning. Play your newly converted lap steel guitar.
Let the bulb cool to room temperature before you handle it.  Many recessed fixtures hold the bulb in with a metal collar. These are often removable, but follow the instructions below to avoid damaging your ceiling.   This is not necessarily the large ring that holds in the entire fixture, although it can be. Look closely for a second ring flush against the light bulb., If someone has painted over the ring, it may rip away pieces of drywall when you unscrew it. To avoid this, cut the paint around the ring with a utility knife, working it against the collar.Now try the steps below until you find one that works for your model.  If you're lucky, your collar is simply held in place by a couple of screws. Some models have a small metal button, which you push or slide sideways to free the fixture., Some models can be twisted or pulled out by hand. Use light pressure only, unless you have confirmed this is the intended approach with a manual or the manufacturer. Here are two examples of light fixtures you can remove this way:   Modern recessed halogen lights often have a plastic collar with three tabs. Press your fingers against these tabs and rotate counterclockwise. Once you have access to the bulb, grip the base and the wire and wiggle them apart.Some recessed LED light fixtures can be pulled directly out of the ceiling. Watch your fingers, as a sharp metal clip will pop downward from the edge as the fixture emerges. You can then unclip the bulb from the wire., Some older halogen fixtures use a small, toothed, metal ring with no special fastener. Carefully insert a flathead screwdriver in between the ring and the light bulb, and pry outward. There is a gap in the ring, so you can flex it outward and carefully pull it down with your fingers. Grip the base of the bulb and gently wiggle the two prongs out of the socket to remove it.Take care not to chip the glass with the screwdriver.  If there is no obvious fastener for the ring, but it refuses to twist out, it may be jammed. Try gently pushing up on the light bulb with a couple fingers from each hand. If the bulb recesses further into the ceiling, press your fingers outward against opposite sides of the ring. Try to rotate the ring while pressing to improve your grip.If this still doesn't work, and your model has three small tabs on the plastic collar, grip one of the tabs with a pair of pliers. Push with the pliers as you push another tab by hand.	Turn off the light. Look for a metal ring around the light bulb. Cut away paint if necessary. Look for a screw or button. Test whether the collar twists or pulls out. Pry out the ring with a screwdriver. Remove a stuck ring.
One of the best ways to ensure a small business will be successful is planning ahead. Even if you’re fully capable of top notch auto body work, starting a business requires substantial research, analysis, and consideration. In short, have a thorough business plan in place before committing to opening a business of your own.Start by writing a detailed company description. For instance, address whether you’ll have a full-service shop of specialize in one service. Will it cater to a specific clientele, such as Japanese cars, or provide service to any type of vehicle? A well-developed business plan will help at every step of the process. In particular, you'll benefit from more favorable lease agreements, credit lines, conversations with potential vendors, funding opportunities, and even operational practices. Don’t think of a business plan as a tool to help you run a business. Instead, develop your plan as a way to decide whether you can move forward opening an auto body repair shop in a particular area.; , The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) is the best source of assistance in starting your own business. In particular, the SBA provides instructions and formatting guidelines to help you write a business plan. These materials are available for free online. The SBA will also be able to notify you of other helpful organizations that might have more specific advice regarding the auto repair industry.The SBA can also link you with local organizations, individuals, and resources to help plan, finance, and open a business. Further, the SBA may be able to link you with a successful business professional that is willing to donate their time to help a small business. If this opportunity is available, ask about working with someone who has experience working with auto shops.  Particularly if you do not have experience starting small businesses, you’re going to need a good amount of guidance. For instance, do you know how to construct a profit and loss statement, balance sheet, and other financial statement? If not, you’ll need to hire, befriend, or otherwise acquire the assistance of an account. You’ll likely also need a lawyer to determine the best structure of your business. Finally, bankers see plenty of business plans – you can likely find one that’s willing to look at yours and provide feedback free of charge.While other auto-body repair shops may not want to help the competition, contact other local businesses that work on automobiles in a different capacity. For instance, parts stores or junkyards will likely know a lot about the local automotive community, including potential customers. Particularly if the ownership of your business will be shared, or you’ll be taking out loans to cover start-up costs, make sure to talk to both a lawyer and a financial professional while crafting your business plan.  There are often city, county, and state-level small business centers that are tasked with the enforcement of business regulations. Auto body shops require various special licenses and permits, and these offices can tell you what you will need and help you get it. The SBA can help link you up with local offices that can inform you of the regulations you’ll need to meet.Auto-repair shops must have permits to do business, as well as specific permits to perform particular types of jobs, such as paint-removal and painting. It’s helpful to know about any pertinent regulations during the planning phase, to incorporate any potential costs or other issues associated with meeting these requirements.  Aside from knowing where business will come from, you also need to know how much – and how fast – the business can be expected to grow. Be able to articulate where, specifically, money will come from, as well as what operational expenses will be. For instance, initial and recurring costs must be recorded, as well as a loan repayment plan, and the level of profits that are expected each month or quarter.Forecast these figures for the first three years after opening. Decide on the prices your shop will charge for specific services. These can be used alongside your anticipated customer projections to determine revenue estimates. Establish a “break-even” point. This is the point at which the business will be generating revenue, as opposed to spending money as it gets up and running. It may take longer to “break even” than you initially realize.  Simply stated, you need to know how much money you’ll need to open the business and maintain operations until your shop starts generating revenue. If you intend to borrow money by way of a loan, it is especially important to determine a concrete dollar amount to ask for. Unfortunately, there's no ballpark number, since differences in location, equipment, and shop size can cause start-up costs for auto body repair shops to fluctuate considerably. This is partly why is so important to develop a solid business plan, as it is the best way to accurately estimate your start-up costs.Know that SBA-insured loans are one of the best sources of funding for a small business. This is another reason you should follow the SBA’s guidelines when developing your business plan.  Equipment expenses are commonly underestimated. While you may be able to save money buying used equipment, there is a greater chance of unforeseen costs associated with maintaining older equipment. A good rule of thumb: estimate your initial equipment and inventory expenses and increase the number by thirty percent. While this may seem like a huge amount of money, it's far better to wind up spending less than expected than it is to wind up needing to borrow more.For example, if you estimate needing $100,000 dollars' worth of equipment to open the shop, plan to secure funding for $130,000 dollars' worth of equipment. Make a detailed list of all the equipment you’ll need and its cost. This should include everything: lifts, wheel balancers, hoists, paint guns, paint mask, and the decorations in the reception area. If you intend to lease some equipment, consider a SBA-backed loan, which may offer you a low interest loan with no down payment to pay for equipment.  In simplest terms, plan to open an auto body shop in the best location you can afford. In particular, you want a location that is easily accessible from major roads. Ensure any location you’re considering is zoned for commercial use. Taking out a slightly larger loan to help finance a business in a location where it is more likely to succeed may even allow for you to negotiate a lower interest rate., You have the option of franchising your business as opposed to opening and running your own business from the ground up. The main benefit of franchising is a considerable reduction in the likelihood that your business fails. This relative advantage is based on multiple factors, including name recognition, large scale marketing, and "tried-and-true" managerial and operational procedures.To find out about franchising options in your areas, contact the corporate offices for the auto body repair "chains" that are popular in your state. Be sure to contact them all, and be aware that they may be willing to meet or beat another franchise's offer. Seek the advice of an account and/or lawyer regarding any specific legal or financial questions you have. Of course, there are costs associated with franchising. The bottom line is that you'll make a smaller portion of what your shop pulls in, though this depends on your specific franchising agreement. On the other hand, you may also avoid costs that may be incurred if you open a business on your own and make errors that a franchising agreement may have prevented.  Assess whether a market exists for the type of business you hope to open. In the most basic sense, a comprehensive business plan helps identify potential issues before they arise. In particular, ensure that there’s actually business to get!Specific statistics to look out for include the number, age, and types of vehicles in the area you’re considering. Additionally, find out what insurance companies are commonly used in the area, and how many similar businesses you’d be competing with.  Large businesses that you may want to work with can offer you a wealth of knowledge, and potentially even assist you. Often, these companies will make business development consultants available to potential new partners. Some may even be willing to help with your business plan, as your success would potentially lead to further business for them.Further, they may help you with marketing. They will have access to marketing data, and will be up-to-date on new technologies and marketing practices. You can also likely find quick assistance from business partners regarding layout and design of your marketing materials. Establish positive relationships with specific employees at suppliers. This will likely help ensure the supply channels you will rely on once your business is open run smoothly.  Marketing plans are some of the most important features of a solid business plan. The options are endless: consider flyers, print ads in local publications, and online advertising. When writing about the services and products you’ll provide, describe them as though whomever is reading them knows nothing about auto body repair. In particular, outline how what you offer will be different from what competitors already offer.Reach out to the local auto-restoration community. People who frequently work on classic or antique cars will often work with auto body shops. You can even offer people who are active in these communities discounts, knowing that they may valuable sources of recurring business., It may prove to be extremely lucrative to be on insurance companies’ “recommended repair facility” lists. Often, people will ask their insurance companies who to go to for service, particularly when they anticipate their insurance company paying for some or all of the service. By developing good relationships with those companies directly, you’ll bring in additional customers.Feel free to be direct. Ask insurance company representatives how you can get on the recommended repair facilities list.  While experience is highly valuable, it’s also vital that your employees are trustworthy and polite. Personable service leads to happier customers, better reviews, and more business. More simply, friendly, happy employees lead to happy customers. Hire accordingly.   Include detailed estimates of anticipated labor costs in your business plan as well. For instance, employer-paid taxes and benefits will likely lead to high labor costs than you would foresee based only on the going hourly rate for auto techs.  You'll need to register your business with the city, state and federal government. Since specific registration requirements will vary, contact your state’s DMV for information on the requirements in your area. Plan to prove that you have ownership or permission to use the facilities where your shop is located, as well as proof of the appropriate zoning. Further, you’ll need proof of an official business name, as well as proof of worker’s compensation insurance., Your shop will be generating hazardous wastes that will affect both air and water quality near your facility. Accordingly, you must demonstrate that you are consistently meeting both state and federal regulations. The regulations you’ll need to meet depend on what services you offer at your shop, as well as it’s location and proximity to municipal facilities. Find your state’s guide to environmental compliance for auto repair shops on the Environmental Protection Agency website.	Start working on a business plan. Get guidance writing your business plan from the SBA. Get local business advice. Get advice directly from a local government office. Specify your expected revenue for the first few years. Determine the amount of funding you’ll need. Over-estimate equipment and materials expenses. Be willing to invest in the best location you can find. Consider opening an auto body franchise location. Conduct formal market analysis. Develop relationships with paint and parts companies. Specify your marketing intentions. Contact auto insurance representatives. Interview and hire employees. Register your auto body shop. Ensure that your business will meet body shop regulations.
You can also use last year's cages again. Tomato cages can be metal, wooden or plastic. Metal cages hold up better against the elements but can be prone to rust. Garden shops and home improvement centers sell tomato cages in all 3 varieties. Check previously-used metal cages for rust. Tomato cages can be reused every year, but metal cages can rust due to rain and the elements. Check each tomato cage for rust and broken wires. Replace any faulty or rusty cages to avoid scrapes or cuts when gardening.; ,   Plan to cage tomatoes after a regular watering. This will soften the soil and make it easier to push the cages into the dirt. Watering will also revive any drooping or wilting tomato plants, making it easier for you to install the cage around the plant.  The stake will help support the weight of the plant and direct its growth upwards.   Use 1 wooden garden stake per tomato plant. Space the stake about 2 inches from the main trunk or base of the plant to avoid hitting its roots.  Pound it down 2 to 3 inches so it's stable. Be sure to hold the stake straight while you pound it into the ground.   To support heavier plants, anchor them to the stake. Tie a piece of coated wire or twine around the base of the plant and the stake. This will keep the plant from breaking under the weight of the fruit and help it climb up the cage.    Hold the tomato cage above the plant and stake. Center it so that they are in the middle of the cage. Lower the cage down slowly over the plant, being careful not to impale any leaves or tomatoes.    Push the cage down with both hands or use the hammer to pound the wire anchors of the cage into the ground. The wire anchors should be completely anchored into the dirt so the bottom rung of the tomato cage is even with the base of the tomato plant.    Place a hand on either side of the top of the cage and try to move it. It's stable if it holds in place and the plant doesn't move. Pound it down into the ground another inch if the cage shifts when force is applied.    Position the plant's branches so that they are over the rungs of the tomato cage and being supported by the structure. This encourages the plant to continue using the cage for support.  Remove it when the plant stops producing fruit.   Check the plant inside the cage frequently and adjust branches if needed to help it support its weight on the cage. Prune plants and harvest tomatoes through the open sides of the cage. When the plant is done producing tomatoes, pull the cage out of the ground, wash it off to remove dirt or bugs and store it for the winter.	Buy tomato cages at your local garden center. Water plants before caging. Position a stake next to each plant. Use a hammer or mallet to pound the stake into the dirt. Center the cage over the tomato plant and the stake. Push the cage into the ground. Test the cage's stability. Arrange the tomato plant around the cage. Use the cage throughout the tomato season.
You can use newspapers, tissue paper, pages of notebook or any other paper. Tear it into small pieces. Keep the torn pieces inside a small bowl or a plastic glass.; ,, Mix the ingredients well. This is very similar to making a real cake, where the paper acts as flour, water as the eggs and talcum powder as baking powder!   The amount of talcum powder depends on how much paper mixture there is. Add gradually, until a good paste like consistency has been formed.  This will help the observer to guess at the flavor of the cake. For example, orange color for orange cake, brown for chocolate cake and white for vanilla cake. This will act as food colouring.  For example, you could use a heart shape mould, a circle mould or a square mold, depending on the person you're giving the paper cake to. , For best results Let it dry for four complete days. Do not take out the mixture from the mould before three days have passed.  Take a health drink packet and cut the bottom edge in the shape of one fourth of a circle. Wrap a rubber band or a thread around to close the bag. Make a small hole at the tip of the bag.  Then mix it all together well. Choose the poster color according to the color of the cake, or according to your preference.  Close the bag with either a rubber band or thread.  Create beautiful patterns on the cake. Let the cream dry for 1-2 days.  Once the cream has dried on the cake, you can add additional decorative elements if wished, or leave it as it is. Once everything has dried completely, the cake is ready to give as a gift or use as a decoration. It's delicate, so be sure to place it on something firm, such as a plate for display or inside a little box for gifting.	Choose paper that is suitable for turning into the cake. Add water to the paper pieces according to the amount of the paper you've torn up.  , Add talcum powder to thicken the mixture. Add some poster color or watercolor in the mixture. Take a mould of the shape which you would like to provide the cake with. Transfer the wet paper mixture to the mould.  , Let the mixture dry in sunlight or in air for two to three days. Make the cream bag first. Prepare a required quantity of poster or watercolor and some talcum powder to it. Transfer the cream mixture to the cream bag. Press the bag on the cake. Done.
There are several choices, such as:   Simply hang on the wall as it is Frame it either using cardstock or a wooden frame, then hang or lean on a shelf Take a photo and share it online (if it's not already digital) Share online if digital; use photo and craft sites, as well as social media sites to let people know about your craft efforts Consider ways of including the collage into other art or craft projects, such as varnishing it into a wardrobe panel, decoupaging it onto a wooden box or sewing a fabric one onto clothing.	Consider how you'd like to display the final collage.
One the most common types of piano today is the upright piano. These pianos are both normally 58 inches (147.3 cm) wide, and despite their differences, both the full vertical and the smaller studio upright can be moved using essentially the same method.   The smaller "studio" uprights usually weigh between 400 and 600 pounds. The monstrous "full vertical" or large upright piano can weigh as much as half a ton. A studio piano's center of gravity is also lower than a large upright's, as it is about 4 feet (1.2 m) tall as opposed to a large upright's roughly 5-foot height.  Begin by clearing a path to your destination and measuring all entrances to ensure that the piano will fit through them.   Have your moving truck open with the ramp deployed, if you are moving the piano onto the truck. Try to get one person per 100 pounds of estimated weight to help you move your piano. Ensure that every member of your piano moving grew is wearing rugged leather work gloves, and if at all possible, thick weightlifting support belts to help prevent back strain.  Unlike a spinet, these larger upright piano models are too top-heavy and bulky to reasonably move without tilting them onto a wide dolly. After you have locked the piano down and wrapped it in blankets and tape, move the dolly to one end of the piano and, with the help of your crew, gently lean it back onto the dolly.   As many people as possible should be at the dolly end of the piano, to support its weight as it tips back, and along the sides of the piano to keep it on an even keel. This is an especially important point to remember with large upright pianos, since they tend to be quite top-heavy. Don't let gravity do any of your work for you; ease the piano gently using manpower from beginning to end.  With your crew supporting the weight of the piano according to its center of gravity, lead it slowly by the dolly to its destination.   If the piano is too high on the dolly to move through a doorway, it will have to be lifted and scooted slowly through the door a few inches at a time. Once it is through the doorway, be sure it is settled firmly on the dolly before continuing to move it. The proper way to lift any object is to squat, maintain a straight back, and lift with your legs. Be sure everyone who is helping you move knows to lift this way. If the piano feels out of balance at any time, yell “Stop!” and instruct everyone to gently set the piano down. Make any required adjustments to the position of the dolly or your crew and try again.	Know your piano. Plan your route. Prepare the piano. Move the piano.
You'll need to make sure that the wire you choose is thin enough for your seed beads, which can come in different sizes. If you are interested in using a thicker gauge wire, you should be sure the beads you purchase fit the thicker wire.Size 15/0 seed beads (1.3 mm) should usually be able to fit on 16 gauge wire and thinner. Larger seed beads, like size 6/0 (3.3 mm), will accommodate thicker wire, in this case eight gauge and thinner. Due to differences in the finishing process of seed beads used by bead producers, seed bead diameters are only an approximation, and may require thicker or thinner wire.; , You should be sure that your work area is clear before you attempt to cut and shape the band of your ring.You might also consider putting your beads into containers. This will make the beads more accessible and decrease your chances of a spill.  Take your ruler and measure out about five inches (13 cm) of wire. Then bend it slightly where you have measured to mark where you will cut. You may need your pliers to bend the wire, but once you do:   Use your wire snips to cut loose the wire you will be using as the band of your ring.  This is the main bead that will form the top of your ring. Using a large bead for your centerpiece can give your ring a cool distinguishing feature, but if you prefer, a regular sized bead will work just as well. Simply thread your centerpiece bead onto the end of your wire.   If a bead centerpiece isn't your style, you might think about using a charm attached to a jump ring. Be sure your jump ring is small enough that it is held in place by the beads you will be threading on your band., Take your needle nose pliers and grasp the wire where you have just threaded your bead. Hold the wire firmly with your pliers, and then bend it over the bead to create a small, squashed loop.This bend in the wire will prevent beads slipping off as you work.  Then you'll be able to thread it all the way down your wire until it joins your centerpiece bead.Keep in mind that your first bead will form the top of your ring, and the beads following it will wrap around the band.   Alternating short patterns by using two or three beads of different color can create nifty designs in your ring. Keep your patterns short; the band of your ring will likely not be long enough to work with longer patterns.  Don't worry about using too many beads; you can always take some off.  Coil your wire so that it loops in on itself, with the unbent end circling around to meet the other end. Hold the free end with your hand, and then tighten the loop around the finger of your free hand to see if your beads wrap the full way around to form a snug fitting band.   If the band of your ring is too tight, you should add a few more beads. If the band is too loose, simply remove a few beads and then try it on your finger again.  Thread the free end of your wire through the loop you made to hold your centerpiece in place. Then, wrap the excess wire two or three times around the band to secure it in place.Finish your beaded ring by using your wire snips to cut free any left over wire.Bend any sharp edges either inward toward a bead or outward and away from where your finger will go to prevent being poked by your snipped wire.	Assemble your ring-making supplies. Prepare your work space. Cut the band of your ring. Add your centerpiece bead. Create a stopper for your centerpiece. Slip a bead through the free end of your wire. Add beads until the band of your ring is complete.As you add beads and the band of your ring grows in length, you should hold your finger alongside to gauge whether or not the band is big enough for you. Test the length of the band of your ring. Finish your beaded ring by securing the open end.
; , This is usually behind a cabinet door, or behind a small piece of paneling screwed to the wall.  You should be able to see the water lines running to and from the water heater.  There should be either one or three valves.  Depending on whether you have a one valve system or a three valve system, here is what to do next:   One Valve System: Turn the valve to the vertical position. This valve should be on the lower line connected to the water heater. Three Valve System: Turn the top and bottom valves to the closed position (usually perpendicular to the line). Then turn the middle valve to the open position (usually parallel to the line).	Note the location of the water heater access door on the exterior of the RV. Go inside and find the inside access to the water heater. Open the inside access to the water heater. Count the number of valves on the water lines connected to the water heater. Follow the step according to the valve system you have.
A magnifying glass might come in handy for looking for certain markings on each coin.; , An envelope or jar will serve that purpose quite well. There are special folders or albums that you can buy which have special slots in them for each coin. At the right price, they will cost around $5 (depending on size)  , Collect only pennies, or nickels, or only coins made in or after a certain year.  There's a history/geography lesson on each coin which provides a wonderful opportunity for children to learn about the country or world they live in.  These can be found at any library or in any book store. There is also a book called Coin Collecting for Kids that helps expand the child's idea of just collecting for fun.	All you really need is some loose change and you are ready to go. You may also need something to store your coins in. The best way to for children to start a coin collection is to narrow the focus. Do some research about the images on the coins. For the advanced coin collector, a coin reference book would be helpful.
There are many ways to celebrate Australia Day and all of them are good because you can catch up with mates. Probably the main "rule", if there are any rules, is just don't celebrate it alone! Get out there and enjoy it with lots of other people. Different ideas include:   Attending an official event (concerts, award ceremonies, fireworks, parades etc.) Attending a local event (regattas, community barbecues, sausage sizzles, face painting, musical events etc.) Holding a party or barbecue at home Going to the pub for celebratory drinks Having a celebration at work Spend time at the beach or pool cooling down. Do this before an evening of partying - or make this the party too! Visit museums and learn about Australia's history Other. If you're stumped for ideas, check out the official list at A to Z of Event Ideas ; , Use clothes, face paints, temporary tattoos, sunbrellas, jewellery etc. in a range of styles and colours to suit the occasion. For colours, there is a selection of possible colour schemes here:   Red, white and blue to reflect the flag, with some stars thrown in; Wattle yellow and eucalyptus green reflecting past colour schemes and colours of the land; The colours of the Aboriginal flag - black, red (ochre) and yellow; The colours of the Torres Strait Islander flag - green, blue and white. (And perhaps the white dhari (headdress) symbol); A "national costume" of your choosing (hold a competition and award prizes); Anything goes. Provided you get up in time to make the celebrations, wear anything comfortable and a hat.  Many cities and towns have fireworks in the evening. Grab a blanket, a picnic basket, some food and drinks and head out at a reasonable hour to get a good vantage point. Take a radio if the radio show follows the fireworks; many stations add music that is timed to the fireworks.    Visit Sydney. See the boats in the Harbour by day and watch the amazing fireworks display at night. Visit the capital. Go and celebrate in Canberra, the heart of the nation. Here you can watch Australia Day awards ceremonies, attend picnics, see fireworks displays, enter a triathlon (or just watch it) or watch the Chief Minister's sailing regatta.  Hoist an Australian flag up in the front yard, hang it from your car or wear it emblazoned across a t-shirt. You can choose from the Australian National flag, the Aboriginal flag, the Torres Strait Islander flag or other Australian flags.  Bake up a feast of lamingtons, pavlova, koala shaped biscuits and meat pies. Make a cake in the shape of Australia. Make a pie floater or two for the 3am munchies.  Make craft items with the kids that reflect Australian themes, such as platypus masks, koala stuffed toys, kangaroo cut-outs and gumnut keyrings.  If you know how, play it for your local community (but note that in traditional Aboriginal culture only the men were allowed to play the didgeridoo). Donate funds to a local charity. Give them away as gifts, sell at craft stalls to enthusiastic Aussie celebrators or wear them - whatever takes your fancy.  Look online for sites that provide this resource and wish your fellow Australians a very happy Australia Day.  Play it, watch it or humour those who can't get enough of it. This is the season for cricket and tennis - when too much sport is barely enough. One time-honoured tradition is to catch a cricket game in the day and the fireworks by night.	Decide how you'd like to celebrate. Dress up in Aussie colours. Watch the fireworks. Visit another Australian city to discover their celebrations for something different this year. Fly the Australian flag. Make Australian food. Make Australian crafts. Play the didgeridoo. Send an Australia Day e-card to friends and colleagues. Get into sport.
Whatever it is you’re trying to be talented at, you know you have to practice. This is especially true if you hope to be talented in multiple areas. Fortunately, you may not need to practice quite as much as you think, and can likely make the time to practice multiple skills every day. In order to get the most out of the time you put in, you have to focus on what you’re hoping to learn.   Practice two different skills 40-45 minutes each, every day for a month. Don’t worry if you miss a day of practicing one of your talents once in a while. If you practice each skill almost every day for a month, you’ll have put in about 20 hours of focused practice on improving each of the talents you hope to develop!; , In order to practice deliberately and efficiently, you need to make sure you are absolutely focused during practice. One way to help maximize the efficiency of your practice time is to deconstruct the talents you hope to improve upon into specific skills.   Ask yourself; What, specifically, do you need to be good at in order to be more talented at whatever ability you’re developing? Choose specific objectives to achieve each time you sit down to practice something. Repeat a small task or process many, many times until you’ve mastered it.For instance, if you’re trying to improve your ability to play a sport, choose an extremely basic aspect of playing that sport and spend 45 minutes straight on just that specific aspect.  For example, if you’re hoping to become a better soccer player, dribble a soccer ball back and forth on the field with just one foot. If you’re hoping to improve your talent as a basketball player, shoot only lay-ups.   Deconstructing your effort to improve one talent will help you improve other talents as well. Following the sports example, doing anything physically active will get you in better shape and improve your coordination, both of which will increase your physical abilities generally.  Practice enough so that you are able to both notice and correct errors in your execution of a particular ability. (Once you’ve completed a disciplined practice routine, during which you practice almost daily for a month, you will likely reach this point.)   Moving forward, your practice will become more efficient. This is because you have gained a solid base of knowledge from which your talent will more naturally progress. For instance, if you’re hoping to improve your ability to play an instrument, practice playing the same single notes or chord so frequently than you automatically know exactly what you did wrong when the sound is even a little bit off.  Dabbling and practicing are different things. Jogging or painting twice a week are fun and healthy things to do, but in order to acquire talent, you need to be more disciplined in your pursuit of improvement. Something that may help you be persistent is choosing two very different talents to practice and improve upon during the same time period.   Get in the groove of practicing at the same time of day each day. Try practicing skills related to two talents you’re hoping to improve upon back-to-back. Get in the habit of practicing one talent then immediately practicing the other. For example, right when you get home from a daily run, sit down to paint. Grouping your practice sessions together will encourage you to do both consistently. Work on two widely different talents to increase the variety of your daily activities. Following the example used in this step, doing something active like running pairs well with something creative and contemplative, like painting.  Do not rely entirely on willpower to focus adequately during practice time. Here are a few tips to ensure your practice time is free of interruption:   Set aside a block of time devoted exclusively to practice and commit to practicing for that full length of time. Set a timer if you’d like. Turn your phone on silent. Make sure there are no screens running in your vicinity (unless you’re using them to help you practice). If you have music playing, consider choosing something without lyrics.	Practice. Deconstruct the talents you hope to acquire. Practice until you can self-correct. Be consistent and persistent. Remove distractions during practice.
Like any other aerosol spray, WD-40 distributes its contents as a kind of cone-shaped cloud. With the smart straw in place, however, you’ll be able to emit WD-40 in a thin precision stream. This is ideal for applying WD-40 to a door hinge.The smart straw is a long red tube that, in its undeployed state, remains snug against the WD-40 cannister. If your WD-40 comes with a smart straw, snap it into place by pulling up on the gray base of the red tube. This base is located near the top of the WD-40 canister.; , With the WD-40 smart straw in place, position the canister so that the end of the tube is about one inch (two centimeters) from the door hinge to which you wish to apply WD-40. If you’re using a WD-40 canister that doesn’t have a smart straw, identify the location of the actuator orifice (the place from which the WD-40 issues) and aim it toward the door hinge. The actuator orifice should be one inch (two centimeters) from the door hinge you wish to apply WD-40 to., Once you’ve positioned the smart straw or actuator orifice appropriately, you’re ready to apply the WD-40 to the door hinge. WD-40 canisters emit their contents quite quickly, so do not hold the actuator down for prolonged periods. Instead, press down on the actuator using your index finger, then release it quickly. WD-40 will leave the canister. Apply the WD-40 in quick bursts, moving from the top of the door hinge to the bottom., Clean the door hinge off. Applying WD-40 to your door hinges will cause them to attract dust and turn black.After applying WD-40 to the door hinge, wipe it clean by dipping a microfiber cloth in some hot, soapy water. Wring it out, then wipe the door hinge with the cloth. To prevent rust, wipe the hinge down with a dry microfiber cloth.	Use the smart straw, if available. Hold the nozzle an inch (2 cm) from the hinge. Spray the WD-40 in quick bursts. Wipe away the excess WD-40.
Find an area in your garden where you can cultivate asparagus for many years. Choose an area with good drainage and preferably with light, sandy soil. Make sure that it is fully in the sun. Avoid areas with poor air flow or where asparagus has been planted before., Have your soil tested for pH levels and acidity. Alternatively, purchase a soil testing kit to do this yourself. Purple asparagus needs soil with a pH level between 6.5 and 7.0. Repeat the tests every three years to see if you need to make any changes to your asparagus bed.Amend the soil with lime if the pH level is too low. Till the lime deeply into the soil.  A year before you plant your purple asparagus, grow buckwheat on the site in the summer. Grow rye or wheat on the site in the fall and winter. This will also increase the organic matter in the soil., Begin preparing the asparagus bed in late fall. Spread a three inch (7.62 cm) layer of mulch, manure, leaf mold, wood shavings, or compost into the bed. Dig or till it down to about 10-12 inches (25.4-30.48 cm) below the surface. Turn the soil so it covers all of your organic matter., Plant asparagus with basil, beets, lettuce, parsley, spinach, strawberries, and tomatoes. Maximize the nutrient levels in your garden by planting purple asparagus with strawberries, which root on different levels. Don’t rotate asparagus onion, leeks, chives or garlic, which can transmit diseases to your asparagus planting., Dig your trenches about 8-10 inches (20.32-25.4 cm) deep in sandy soil. If you have more clay in your soil, dig the trenches about 6 inches (15.24 cm) deep. Lay down some phosphate fertilizer prior to planting.Start planting when temperatures are between 75 and 85 degrees Fahrenheit (23.88 and 29.44 Celsius) during the day and around 60 degrees Fahrenheit (15.55 degrees Celsius) in the evenings.  Plant the crowns between 8 and 12 inches (20.32 and 30.48 cm) apart in the center of the trench. Prior to planting, put 2 inch (5.08 cm) mounds of soil in the spots where you will place the crowns. Put the crowns above the roots. Be sure to remove any rotten roots before you plant the crowns., Don’t fill in the trenches completely unless you have very sandy soil. Cover the crowns with about 3 inches (7.62 cm) of soil. After six weeks, cover them with another 3 inches (7.62 cm) of soil. Fill in the trenches completely after the plants have gone dormant in the late fall or spring., Hand weed and hoe to remove weeds during the planting year. There aren’t really safe herbicides for purple asparagus in its first year. Pull out weeds early and often. Also mulch your asparagus bed to prevent weeds., Check your plants regularly for insects. The most prevalent pest is the asparagus beetle. Look for its dark, slug-like larvae on the ferns. Other signs to look for include insect bites and brown stems. Hand pick the larvae off of the ferns. Spray with an approved pesticide to get rid of adult asparagus beetles.Adult asparagus beetles are red with black spots or metallic-colored with yellow spots.  Look for signs of diseases like wilting and yellowing mature ferns in hot summer weather or light green oval lesions on the shoots that eventually appear as dark blisters. Don’t over harvest the plants and make sure you plant in soil that has good drainage and high pH levels to prevent crown rot. Prevent asparagus rust by removing infested ferns.You can apply an approved fungicide on a seven to ten day cycle starting when the ferns are about 3 feet (0.9 m) (0.914 m) high. Stop using the fungicide in mid-September., During the first year, water your purple asparagus during dry spells. Avoid overwatering because the plants can’t tolerate water-logged soil. Overwatering can also contribute to crown rot and rust. Mulch your asparagus beds well during the summer months to retain moisture in the soil. Use straw, hay, or grass clippings and be sure that your mulch doesn’t contain weeds or weed seeds., Start harvesting your purple asparagus three years after planting the crowns. Only harvest for one month at first. This will let the plant establish its strong root system, which harvesting can weaken. After this, harvest the purple asparagus spears from early spring through May or June for about eight weeks each season., Don’t let the asparagus get much taller or the stalks will be very tough and difficult to harvest. Snap the stalks at the soil surface to harvest. Avoid cutting the stalks, which can injure the crown buds that will produce the next spears., This will help retain moisture in the asparagus bed and allow the plants to grow extensive storage root systems. Allow the asparagus to continue growing after your harvesting season is over. If necessary, stake your plants and tie them with strings for extra support. Plant the rows parallel to your garden’s prevailing wind patterns so the plants can support each other.	Choose an area for establishing your purple asparagus bed. Test the soil. Plant a cover crop to keep the weeds down. Raise the organic matter in the soil. Do companion planting. Plant in trenches. Put the crowns in the trench. Fill in the trenches. Weed carefully. Control for insects. Fight diseases. Water the plants. Plan your harvest. Harvest daily when the spears are about 6-8 inches (15.24-20.32 cm) high. Encourage fern growth.
Look for a line in port on your car stereo. It is usually marked as "Line In" or "Input." Purchase an audio cable that can connect the headphone jack on your digital music player to the line in port on your car's stereo. The type of wire you need to get depends on the specifications of the headphone jack and line in port (audio cable connectors are usually measured as 2.5mm or 3.5mm). Set your car stereo to play the signal it is receiving from the line in port (this can be in the same way you change the setting to any other input signal such as CD, radio or cassette). Hear the songs that you are playing on your digital music player through your car speakers. In summary, you have simply replaced your headphones by choosing your car speakers as the output device instead while using a very similar connection method.	Connect your digital music player to your car's stereo using an audio cable if your stereo has any audio line in ports available.
Nothing does more for a space than filling the walls with artwork, prints, and posters. Choose a selection of artwork and prints in complementary colors and themes; think nature photography, paintings, concert posters, favorite quotes, etc. Head to a local thrift store or the clearance rack of a department store and pick up some picture frames that match the sizes of your artwork. Then, hang your prints all over your home. A bare wall is a boring wall, so try to have at least a few large pieces and a few small pieces of art displayed throughout your house.   Keep in mind that you can paint your picture frames to match your artwork or furniture.       You can purchase incredibly cheap prints of famous paintings online, making it easy to add lots of art to your home.  To make your house truly idiosyncratic and appealing, add framed photos of your favorite memories, trips, people, and locations. You can print large photographs from different experiences throughout your life to hang as centerpieces on your walls, or you can print small versions to place in standing frames around your house. People will love seeing your home filled with your favorite pictures, and you’ll always have good things to be reminded of while you sit and relax.   You can find cheap picture frames for your photos at thrift stores, which can then be painted to match the interior of your house. Try hanging your photographs with assorted artwork in your home in a gallery display. This will allow you to showcase lots of your favorite pieces at once, and add a more personal touch than just paintings might do.  Floating shelves are small rows of shelves that are attached directly to your wall, allowing you to hang prints and photos around them. These are great for placing small decorative items and knickknacks on. Add glass bottles/vases of flowers, trinkets, things you’ve collected from your travels, and other pretty things to the shelves that match your interior decorating. These are also a great way to showcase art and photos without filling your walls with holes to hang them up.   Floating shelves are great for decorating a bathroom and allowing you to store towels and the like with a small amount of space.       Try using floating shelves in your kitchen to store cookbooks and pretty glassware/china.  Generic light covers and shades may come with your home, but they typically lack interest and personality. Mix up your lighting by purchasing new, more decorative options. Look for items to work as your primary light source that match the general style of the room, but that aren’t too bold. Small interesting lamps can be interspersed throughout your home to add light and flare to your style. If you’re interested in DIY, you can purchase old lamps and shades from a thrift store and spray paint or cover them in fabric for a fresh new look.   If you’re using multiple lights in one room, try to vary the sizes, colors, and shapes of the lamps (unless they’re a matching set).You can never have too much light, so don’t be afraid of using several light fixtures in a single room or a small area.  Curtains are one of the most underused style tools in decorating a home. With just a bit of carpentry work, you can install curtain rods and add lovely curtains that match your furniture perfectly. Look for curtains that have plenty of color or pattern to brighten up your room. If you’re working in a space you’d like to keep dark (like a bedroom), you can add room-darkening curtains or drapes in dark hues to block out light. If you’re trying to make a space look bigger, add light colored and textured curtains.  The purpose of rugs is dual in nature: cover up unattractive or dirty flooring and add interest and pattern to your floor. Look for rugs to fill up the empty spaces in your home; these will make your house seem full of furniture even when it's a bit bare. Find rugs in colors and patterns that match your décor (or go with it; too much ‘matching’ might look boring). You can also arrange furniture on a rug. There are basically three ways you can arrange furniture on your rug.,	Hang up some artwork. Add your favorite pictures/memories. Add floating shelves. Use creative lighting. Hang up some new curtains. Look for matching rugs.  You can purchase cuts of carpet and have them finished to create your own rug for your home, for cheap.
You can choose to have your tickets sent by mail or arrange to have them ready for pick-up at an Amtrak kiosk, Amtrak station, or Amtrak vending machine.; ,   There are no penalty fees for changing a reservation. You may be required to pay the difference in cost if your new, updated ticket has a higher rate. For example, if you paid 250 dollars (176 euros) for your original ticket, but the ticket for your new reservation costs 300 dollars (212 euros), you be will required to pay the difference of 50 dollars (35.29 euros).    You can upgrade or downgrade to and from First Class, or make Amtrak sleeping arrangements. If you are modifying First Class or Sleeping Car reservations, you must provide advanced notices of 1 hour, or 7 days, respectively. You will be required to pay penalties or for the full price of the extra accommodations if you do not change your reservations within the advanced notice time-frames.    For example, if you have decided to bring a car instead of a motorcycle, you will need to notify Amtrak to reserve extra room for your automobile.	Change your ticket delivery method. Modify the times or dates of your reservation based on your new traveling plans. Change your class of service. Modify the type of vehicle you are bringing on the train with you if you booked an Auto Train reservation.
The box can be plain, or it can be decorated. Craft stores sell many beautiful cardboard boxes that would be perfect for storing bracelets.  You can make the box all one color, or use different colors for the inside and the outside. If you want to add designs to your box, paint the background color first, let it dry, then add the designs.   If your bracelets are delicate, consider covering the inside of your box with velvet.  You will need these measurements to make your dividers.  This will give you several long compartments for you to store your bracelets in. If you want a half-sided compartment, then cut several shorter pieces of cardboard to use as a divider between two compartments.  You can match the color to the inside of the box, or use a contrasting color. Paint one side and let it dry first. Flip the pieces over, then paint the other side.   If you covered the inside of your box with velvet, then you might want to use velvet for this as well.  Coat the bottom and side edges of a divider with liquid glue, and slide it into the box. It should fit snuggly. If it flops over, consider bracing it with a heavy object, such as a jar. If you need to reinforce the dividers, wait until the glue dries, then draw a line of glue between the seams.   If you are using shorter dividers: glue in all of the long/horizontal dividers first, then add in the short/vertical dividers.  To add a tube, follow the directions below.   Cut the paper towel tube down until it is at least an 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) wider than your box. Paint the tube, or cover it with velvet fabric. Cut deep grooves into each side of the box, wide and deep enough for the paper towel to sit in. Slip your bracelets onto the tube. Set the tube down into the grooves.	Find a cardboard box large enough to hold your bracelet collection. Paint the box using spray paint or acrylic paint. Measure the height and width of box. Cut a few pieces of cardboard according to those measurements. Paint the cardboard pieces using spray paint or acrylic paint. Glue the dividers into the box. Consider adding a paper towel tube for the bracelets that need to be draped.You can take the tube out to remove the bracelets whenever you want. Finished.

Safety is a priority whenever you are working on a car. Before removing the wheels apply the parking brake on to make sure your car is secure.; , While the tires are still on the ground, use a tire iron or air gun to turn the lug nuts and make the wheel easier to remove.  Use the jack to raise the car off the ground. Check your car’s owner’s manual for proper jack placement.          Lift the car high enough to slide a jack stand underneath the frame. Slowly lower the car onto the jack stand. Remove the jack to leave the car resting on the stand.  Use a tire iron or an air gun to remove the lug nuts one at a time.         When all the lug nuts are removed, pull the tire gently toward you. Set the wheel aside with the lug nuts.  If you don’t have four jack stands you can do one wheel at a time, but keep in mind it will take much longer while you wait for paint to dry.  The calipers are usually held in place by one or two bolts in the rear. A ratchet wrench works best to remove the bolts securing the caliper.          Do not disconnect the caliper from the brake line. Be careful not to crimp or damage the brake hose connected to the caliper. Place the caliper on a box or inverted bucket.  Brake pads usually clip in place. Locate the clips that hold the brake pads in place and gently remove the brake pads. Removing the brake pads will ensure that you don’t get paint on them and possibly compromise your car’s braking ability.  Properly cleaning the brake calipers prior to painting will help prevent the paint from flaking off. The cleaning process is crucial to ensure that the paint sticks and you end up with a quality paint job.         Use a stiff wire brush to remove any rust or built up grime on the caliper’s metal parts. Do not brush the rubber casing around the caliper pistons or they may be damaged. Dip the brush in mineral spirits or gasoline as a solvent to aid the cleaning process.Spray brake cleaner on the caliper to remove the bits loosened by the wire brush. Sand the metal parts of the caliper with a 150-200 grit sandpaper. Make sure to get all the bends and groves around the caliper. Give the caliper another cleaning with the spray on brake cleaner. Use a paper towel and rubbing alcohol to clean the calipers one final time.  Take time to carefully cover everything around the caliper so you don’t get overspray in unwanted locations.          Tape the rubber protectors around the caliper pistons. Wrap the brake rotor in newspaper to protect it from paint Cover the panels around the wheel with paper so you don’t get paint on the car.  Calipers are exposed to very high temperatures during braking. Choose a paint that is heat resistant or developed specifically for calipers.Specialty caliper paints can be purchased from auto parts stores. Purchase a heat tolerant spray paint from your local hardware store. Make sure the paint is designed for use on metals.  Spray multiple coats to achieve an even paint job. Do not apply spray paint in thick coats or you will get drips and runs in your paint. Spray smoothly and from different angles to get maximum coverage.         Shake the can and follow the label directions on the paint can. Spray short bursts, not a continuous stream of paint. Move the can from side to side as you spray. Wait 5 minutes between coats of paint. Spray 3 to 4 coats on the top side of the caliper.  After applying multiple coats to one side of the caliper, wait for it to dry to the touch before turning it over.          Repeat the painting process on the opposite side of the caliper Be gentle when turning the caliper so you don’t twist the brake line. You do not need to paint the inner portion of the caliper as this isn’t seen and may affect the performance of your brakes.  Depending on the temperature and humidity, the time it takes for your paint to dry may vary. You don’t want to ruin all your hard work, so make sure the paint is completely dry before replacing the caliper.  This may be a good time replace your brake pads if they are beginning to wear thin.          Use a C-clamp to compress the caliper piston to position the brake pads properly. Bolt the caliper back in place around the brake rotor. Place the caliper back around the rotor and replace the bolts that you removed to take the caliper off. Make sure the bolts are tight to securely reassemble your brake system.  Important:Take care not to twist or crimp the brake line.  Place the tire on the bolts attached to the wheel assembly.          Hand tighten the lug nuts onto the bolts. Use a tire iron or an air gun to tighten the lug nuts. Tighten the lug nuts in a criss-cross pattern alternating sides rather than in a circular pattern.  Slowly raise the car about an inch to slide the jack stand out from under the car.          Remove the jack stand. Lower the car to the ground. Double check that your lug nuts are securely tightened.  It may be hard to resist taking your fresh calipers out for a spin, but waiting the added time will ensure that the paint cures to the metal and doesn’t peel off due to the heat of braking., Make sure your brakes are working properly. Enjoy the looks from the people you pass admiring your newly painted calipers.	Apply the parking brake. Loosen the lug nuts ¼ turn. Position your jack under the frame of the car next to the wheel you are removing. Remove the lug nuts from the wheel to remove it. Repeat the process for all four wheels. Remove the calipers from the wheel assembly. Separate the brake pads from the caliper. Clean the calipers thoroughly. Use tape and newspaper to mask the area around the caliper that is not being painted. Select a high quality paint. Paint the caliper one side at a time. Allow the caliper to dry for 30 minutes, then paint the other side. Allow the paint to dry for one hour before replacing the caliper. Click the brake pads back in place on the caliper. Position the tire back on the car. Use a jack to remove the car from the jack stand. Wait 24 hours for the paint to cure completely. Take the car out for a test drive.
Preferably one that does not already require a large amount of work. You don't want to spend all of your time & money on repairing the car.  If its not a common vehicle make, you may need to come up with your own ideas., These are not cheap, unless you can do it yourself. Some of these modifications are more ideal to leave for the pros to do, they include:  BODY KITS.  You can buy these pre-made or have one custom made.   PAINT.  Although airbrushing & graphics can be cool, it can be over done. Try avoid going over the top, a nice two-tone paint or a nice glossy one colour can score big points.   BODY MODS.  Mods such as, rolling the guards, adding wings/spoilers, aftermarket side mirrors & lights, just look for nice things that you can add to the body of the car. If you have a common make, there will be a lot out there.   INTERIOR.  Trimming seats/dash/pillars/floors/roof etc can score big points. Adding some colour like painting small plastic bits to suit the exterior colour can be good sometimes. Look for other aftermarket parts like: pedals, shift-knob, steering wheel, and just anything else that is not factory. These items usually very simple to install yourself. Adding lighting can be good, but try make it hidden so people only see the Glow, there is nothing worse than having a bright light in your face. Gauges are only cool, if they have a purpose. E.g Boost gauges for TURBO cars only. I.C.E (In Car Entertainment - TV screens, speakers, cd player, dvd players, ps3 or xbox, custom installs, subwoofers, amps, etc etc. All of these items installed properly and customized, can get you big points! Try keep it all one brand and try not to get to mixed up.   ENGINE.  The mods you can do will depend on what kind of car you have, and how fast you want it to go. Best to do some major research. See what can be done. Maybe go to some performance car workshops & see what they purpose. The main things that are done to show cars are: turbo setups or superchargers, custom air intake, custom exhaust system & upgraded parts depending what mods you do. Adding some colour & polishing metal parts can also score big on engines & engine bays. Try make it look "bling" and people will love it.   WHEELS & SUSPENSION & BRAKES.  Massive wheels on a small car and vice versa can look ridiculous. Try the wheels on before buying, try a few sets and pick your favorite. Suspension & Brakes should be based on what engine mods you have done. You want to go fast, then you have to be able to stop & you want the car to handle good.  Some States & Countries have banned certain modifications to save getting in trouble with the police, stick to the Law! Most shops can help you with that., You may not win any, it depends on how extreme you go but at least you've got a PHAT RIDE! If you do not want to go to shows, at least you can show it off while cruising & picking up chicks!	Buy yourself a car.  Search the internet to get ideas on what other people may have done to the make of vehicle you bought - if it's a popular make, there should be a few show-cars/modified versions.  Some of the following modifications, can make your car a show car.  Make sure what you plan on doing is legal in the State or Country you live in.  Once the car is finished, take it to your local Car show & start winning those trophies!
The Whip is a dance that involves a deep stance, with your feet placed wide apart. To make sure you don't strain anything or lose your balance because your muscles are stiff, you should stretch your legs, paying special attention to your thighs and legs., You'll want to plant your feet on the floor so that you are well balanced and so that each food is wider than shoulder width apart. This should lower your hips, bringing you into a kind of half-squatting position. Your core should be engaged, and your back should be mostly straight with a slight lean forward.If you hunch your shoulders or curl your back forward too much, it can ruin the effect of the Whip. You want to convey both sensuality and attitude through this step.This position can work muscles in your legs that aren't frequently exercised. This means that you may notice muscle fatigue or weakness/shaking if you dance the Whip too much. You don't want your legs to give out on you and end up sitting on the dance floor! If you feel shaking in your leg muscles or a strong burning sensation from fatigue, you may want to take a break., If you are doing this dance move in a group, you'll want to coordinate which hand you raise with the others who are dancing. Raise one arm so it's fully extended and curl your fingers into a closed fist, much like you are gripping a distant steering wheel in front of you.         Your hand should remain out in front of you for the entire time you are doing the Whip. Try not to let your arm dip too much; it should be roughly at chin level. Your non-raised hand should be loose and rest at about hip level. You might even want to rest it on your hip, though what you do with it is up to you! If you are doing the Whip by yourself, you might want to try alternating between hands, especially when linking your whip with freestyle moves. This can make your transitions seem more natural., This should give your body a slight bobbing movement while your feet remain stationary. Your knees and thighs will bend slightly with your bob, but most of the up and down motion should be in your hips and core.         To give your whip style more character, you may want to move your arm in front of you in time with your bobbing to the left and the right. Keep it level with your chin, and allow it to move to the left or right in time with the music. Moving your arm in front of you is a sweet way of combining your whip dance with other freestyle moves. When your arm reaches the far left or right, you can add a spin move, or transition into another step.  When doing the Whip, you're already mostly in position to do the Nae Nae. The Nae Nae also uses a deep stance, but instead of holding one arm in front and the other at your hip, one hand is raised above your hand and the other stretches below your hip. You'll also want to...          Rock back and forth to the left and right. Keep your feet in place and sway your hips to the beat of the music. This back and forth motion should be easy to transition to from the up and down motion of the Whip. Add a connecting move to make your transition from the Whip to the Nae Nae more natural. You might, for example, clap your hands to the beat of the music, bringing the hand at your hip to join the one in front of you. Then spread them apart into Nae Nae position., The Stanky Leg is easy to add to the whip. From the classic Whip pose, extend one of your feet in front of you and plant it on the dance floor. Keeping your planted foot in place, lean your entire body in the opposite direction of your stationary foot. Now move your stationary foot in small, circular motions to complete the move.To continue doing the Stanky Leg, you should alternate between feet, shifting the direction you are leaning back and forth. As you do so, you might want to loosen up and bob in time with the music. To keep your Stanky Leg fresh, you should get your arms involved in the dance. You might want to bend your arms at the elbow, moving them to the beat and crossing them in front of you. You might add the Stanky Leg to your Whip move by allowing your Whip pose to slide into the Stanky Leg. When your arm is in front of you in classic Whip position, allow it to move to the left or right. Lean slightly as you do so, and once you've gone far enough, you should be roughly in position to do the Stanky Leg.  Freestyle is a matter of preference, and you should do what feels right. However, you might want to break up your Whip by taking a few small steps to the beat of the music to reposition yourself on the dance floor, raising your hands in time with the music as you do so.          Another move you might add into your Whip style that is a hand twirl. You can easily raise the hand at your hip while Whipping to join the one on front of you and twirl the two around each other to give your Whip some flavor., Dancing is about expression and enjoying yourself. Experiment with what feels natural and comfortable for your body, but don't let embarrassment or self-consciousness get in the way of you enjoying yourself.          Keep an eye on others who do the Whip to learn new moves. They will likely be flattered you're trying to imitate them and they may give you some pointers!	Limber up. Adopt a deep stance. Raise either your left or right hand in front of you. Bounce your hips up and down in small motions. Transition to the Nae Nae. Alternate your Whip dancing with the Stanky leg. Incorporate freestyle moves. Enjoy yourself.
Focus on Italy - how he acts, what he says, and his interactions with other characters. This will give you a good idea of how to think and behave. Watching both the sub and the dub is best.   Read the webcomic, while you're at it. The webcomic came first, and there are many things in it that never appear in the anime. Take a look at Italy's profile on the wiki for more information. The wiki covers events in both the webcomic and the anime.; , Italy loves pasta more than anything. Whenever you see pasta will be served for lunch at school or you come across an Italian restaurant, get excited. Complain that the stuff that comes from a can isn't authentic and doesn't taste right. However, don't take this too far and insult someone's cooking. He does that in the show, but you shouldn't. You'll come across as rude.  Italy is friendly to at least most people, so you should be as well. Don't take this too far, though. If you know people who act like the characters, treat them how Italy would treat the other countries! You know a Germany? Befriend them! However, if you know someone like Britain, don't run away from them. If anything, just act a bit shy around them. You don't want to be rude.  Italy needs to know how to make pasta, right? Practice cooking until you can make tasty Italian dishes, including several different kinds of pasta. Get good at painting, too. You don't have to be an artistic genius. Just practice your painting and drawing skills and embrace them.  If anyone asks you what's wrong, just say it's nothing an continue to act a bit glum. Don't take this too far, though. Don't bring a tissue box to History and cry your eyes out!  , In at least the English Sub, Italy is shown to be quite innocent. You don't need to be a saint, but don't curse or say rude things about people behind their backs! Italy wouldn't do that, now would he?  , Italy worked at Austria's place as a servant for quite some time, so he's obviously a hard worker. He always lets people help him and he always makes time for his friends, though, so don't push it!  , Think about the good things in life. If you do this incorrectly, you may end up acting like Romano, and that's not what you're here for! Italy never said anything negative about his past, did he?  ,	Watch Hetalia. Declare your love for pasta. Be very friendly around everyone. Practice your painting and cooking skills. Act a bit emotional when the Holy Roman Empire is brought up. Act innocent.

Make the first rectangle 9 1⁄2 inches (24.1 cm) wide and 10 1⁄2 inches (26.7 cm) long; this will be the main part of the bow. Make the second rectangle 2 1⁄2 inches (6.4 cm) wide and 3 1⁄2 inches (8.9 cm) long; this will be the middle piece that cinches the bow into shape.  Make sure the "right" side of the fabric, the side on which the pattern is brighter, is facing in. Only the "wrong" side of the fabric, the side on which the pattern is muted, should be visible.  You can use a sewing machine or make the stitch by hand. Only sew the long edge, opposite the fold; leave the two short ends of the fabric open. You now have an inside-out rectangular tube with a seam down the longer side.  Reverse it so that the bright side of the fabric is facing out. Lay the piece of fabric flat on the table and position it so that the seam runs down the middle of the tube, rather than the side.   Make sure the seam is directly in the center of the fabric by using a ruler or measuring tape to measure the fabric on either side of the seam. The sides should be equal. Position the fabric so that the seam is on the top part of the tube, rather than the bottom part lying flat against the table.  Using your sewing machine or working by hand, make a zig-zag stitch or a straight stitch along the unsewn, unfolded edges of the fabric. You now no longer have a tube, but a folded and sewn square. Reverse the fabric so that the new seam is facing inside.	Cut the fabric into two rectangles. Fold the larger piece of fabric in half lengthwise. Sew the long edges together using a straight stitch. Turn the fabric right-side out. Fold the tube in half width-wise and sew the raw edges.
Journaling is an amazing way to gain insight into your feelings and to record moments from your daily life. Date your entry and write about how you're feeling, what you're seeing and what you're thinking about. Journaling is most effective if it becomes a habit, so try to write in your journal more often than just Saturday nights., Writing a short story often seems daunting, and you may be worried that you don't have enough creativity. However, if you just start typing, you may be surprised at the ideas that come out. If you already have an idea, map it out by creating an outline or a plot arc. Then get to work writing your story. It could be comedy, funny and even sad. Pick any type you want., Poetry is a great way to put your ideas on paper, and it can be even more fun than writing prose. Poetry lets you describe objects and events in creative ways, and the sky is the limit with the amount of creativity you bring. Decide what to write about, and then practice putting your poetic thoughts on paper. Remember, poetry doesn't have to rhyme: it can be as free form as you like.	Write in a journal. Write a short story. Write poetry.
Pre-heat the oven to 350 °F (177 °C). Then, gather the following ingredients:          1 1/4 cup flour 1 1/4 cup salt 1 tablespoon cream of tartar 3/4 cup warm water 1 tablespoon cooking oil; , Use a spoon to mix the ingredients well.          In a variation of this recipe, you can cook the dough in a saucepan. To do this, instead of pouring the the ingredients into a mixing bowl, put them in a saucepan., Pour a small amount of the warm water into the bowl and start mixing the mixture with a spoon. It should start clumping together as you mix.          For the cooked variation, add the water and the oil into the saucepan. Turn the stove eye on low, and continue cooking on low and stirring until the dough has thickened. This may take a few minutes.  Keep pouring the water in as you mix the batter. Soon the ingredients will form a sticky dough.          Many factors affect the consistency of the clay, like humidity in the air and the type and brand of flour being used. If your clay is too watery, add a little more flour. If the clay is too sticky, add a little more flour. If the clay is dry and flaky, add a little water.Add it in very small measures and knead the dough a little. Repeat the process until you think your clay has the right consistency.  When the clay gets too tough to mix, add cooking oil to make it softer. Don't add too much, or it will affect the consistency of the dough and make it harder to mold.          Add a few drops of food coloring to give the clay some color. You can also separate the clay into several pieces and color each one separately for differently colored pieces. Knead the color in with your hands. It may appear marbled at first, but will soon evenly distribute.  After the dough is finished thickening, sprinkle some flour on the counter. Knead the dough on the counter until it is a smooth, stretchy consistency.          You can also use a rolling pin to flatten the dough. You can knead the dough and add food coloring to the dough made in the saucepan variation. Just make sure the dough is cool before you start kneading so you don't burn your hands.  After the dough has been kneaded, shape the clay into different sculptures. If you have colored separate sections of dough different colors, knead them into shapes and then place them next to one another to build elaborate crafts.          Use toothpicks to decorate the clay with holes. You can make eyes, noses and other features. Use cookie cutters to cut out different shapes, or use cookie presses to stamp the clay. Sprinkle the sculptures with some glitter and gently press it into the clay before baking. Take a key ring with a small chain attached and press the end of the chain into the clay. Press more clay around it so that it's secured inside the sculpture.  Place the sculptures on a baking sheet. Make sure none of them are touching or they might fuse. Put the baking sheet of sculptures in the oven. Bake them for 20 minutes, or until the dough is nice and hard. Remove the sculptures from the oven and let them cool completely.          Since the clay you made is basically a dough, it can be baked in the oven until it becomes very hard. Make sure to watch it in case the sculptures start to burn. Baking the sculptures you molded will preserve them for years.  Use poster paint, glitter glue, and other fun craft supplies to paint and decorate the sculptures you have made. You can seal with a coat of clear varnish once the paint has dried. This adds a shiny finish to your clay objects.	Gather the ingredients. Mix the ingredients.Pour the flour, salt, and cream of tartar in a mixing bowl. Add a little warm water. Continue pouring a small stream of water. Add the oil. Knead the dough. Shape the sculptures. Bake the sculptures. Decorate the sculptures.
Bare soil is far more vulnerable to erosion than soil with ground cover. Aim for at least 30% ground cover on all grazing land, ideally 40% or more.After harvesting crops, leave the residue on the soil as a mulch, or plant hardy winter crops.  Tree roots are powerful tools when soil is too eroded or steep to plant. Plant native trees on steep slopes and riverbanks to reduce soil loss.Bare ground around the tress still needs to be covered in mulch or grass for best results.  Deep, frequent tillage creates a layer of compact soil vulnerable to water erosion, topped by loose soil easily removed by wind.Consider a zero-tillage approach using a coulter or other deep planting device.If this is not feasible, try a ridge-till or mulch-till system that leaves the lower soil levels untouched.These conservation tillage techniques also reduce the amount of vehicle traffic, and therefore soil compaction.  Crops with weak roots or that need to be sparsely planted are more vulnerable to erosion. Plant these in strips, alternating with strips of an erosion-resistant crop such as dense grass or legumes.Plant the crops so they contour the slope. Plant these crops perpendicular to the prevailing wind if possible.  Grazing land cannot remain healthy and erosion-resistant if cattle are allowed to graze year-round. For best results, close off a paddock for the entire wet season to allow grasses to reestablish themselves.   This may not be effective if the other paddocks cannot support the spelled cattle. If possible, keep cattle away from riverbanks and heavily eroded soil at all times., Runoff is concentrated into a narrower area as it travels across lands. The points where the concentrated runoff reaches a slope are particularly vulnerable to erosion. You can build a paved flume, or lined channel, to lead the water to a safe drainage system. Build these at gully heads as well.   Another option is to build a swale to re-direct the runoff into a pond. Building several swales along a hillside can greatly reduce runoff volume and eliminate the need for a paved channel.Do not build flumes on slopes steeper than 1.5:1., The steepest slopes are almost impossible to farm on. Turn the hill into terraces instead by building retaining walls running across the slope. In between the walls, grade the soil level to create a flat area resistant to erosion.	Keep soil covered year-round. Plant trees to prevent landslides. Reduce tillage. Protect weak crops with strip cropping. Practice wet season spelling. Control downhill runoff with flumes. Turn a hillside into terraces.
Skipping can also be cause by a worn chain, worn chainrings and worn sprockets.  Disconnect the rear brake and undo the axle nuts.  The freewheel mechanism is contained inside the splined housing.  The process may vary for this step by manufacturer and hub design. Shimano freehubs are held on by a hollow hex bolt inside the housing itself. Remove the bearings on either side before undoing the bolt.  For some Shimano housings, it is possible to add oil from the cog shaped side of the housing. Oil or penetrant loosens up any grease or dirt inside the ratcheting mechanism.  If the hub used to be quiet then the ratcheting sound should get louder. This is a good sign as it means the mechanism isn't damaged. Keep adding oil until the ratcheting sound is clear and the mechanism spins with minimal effort. The end result may leave the hub quite loud and with a barely audible grittiness to it, this isn't a major concern as it takes a long time for the mechanism to wear out completely. Spare housings are also quite cheap.  If there is still skipping, check for other possible sources of the problem or get a new freehub body or even a new hub.	Make sure that the problem is caused by the freewheel. Remove the rear wheel. Remove the cassette. Remove the freehub assembly. Add oil  or penetrating fluid to the ratcheting mechanism from the outside. Work the oil into the ratcheting mechanism. Test drive the bike to see if the fix was successful.
,, It is sold in various widths (and thicknesses) depending on the width and depth of the studs. Always get the proper size - never compress the insulation or you'll reduce it's effectiveness., There are two R-value scales, one US customary and one metric; US customary R-values are 5.68 times metric R-values. The most common is fiberglass insulation, but you can also buy insulation made of minerals, paper, and insulation made of recycled blue jeans. Any materials that could burn are treated with a fire retardant., Small pieces of glass are embedded the insulation and will itch if they contact your skin, or irritate your lungs and eyes. You should always wear eye protection and a face mask with any type of insulation to protect your eyes and lungs from small fragments of insulation that become airborne.,, You'll have to press down on the insulation to make a cut through it., Do not compress it around outlets and other obstacles - simply cut an opening. If there is wiring or plumbing in the wall, the insulation goes behind it if you don't have to compress it too much; otherwise cut the insulation in half width-wise and put half behind the wiring/plumbing and half in front of it., This keeps warm moist air inside your house from migrating behind the wall. Moisture can cause mold problems and will lower the value of your insulation if it gets wet., Cover any seams in the vapor barrier with special tape made for the purpose (called "tuck tape"). You want to have an air proof seal in front of the insulation to prevent air migration from inside your home that has moisture from causing mold formation on the cold walls., If any insulation has touched your skin, wash using COLD water only - hot or warm water will only make your skin more irritated.,	Measure the width between your studs - most common is 16" on center; also measure the depth of the studs - most are 4" dimensional lumber, but if they're thicker you'll need deeper insulation to fill the void properly. ,Measure the size of the area you want to cover - width and height. Go to a home improvement/building supply with your measurements to purchase the insulation needed. There are different R-values of insulation (the higher the R value, the better it will insulate.), If you are using fiberglass insulation, you'll need to wear gloves, eye protection, a face mask and long sleeved clothing.Paper-faced insulation should be inserted into the wall cavity with paper facing out. Measure the length required to fill the cavity, with the insulation on the floor, and with the paper side facing up, cut though it with a utility knife. Insert the insulation in the wall cavity. Once you have your insulation complete, you'll need to cover it with a poly vapor barrier. Attach the vapor barrier to the wood studs with a staple gun. Once you have finished installing the insulation, remove all the clothing that you wore and wash it immediately.You can now proceed to cover the walls with drywall or paneling.
Make sure that it fits first! Smaller notebooks are best, as they take up less space than normal, school-sized ones.  Consider getting a pen that can stay on your notebook for added convenience., Record the date that you're knitting on. Print out, photocopy, or manually copy over the pattern you're working on into your journal. Then while you're working through the project use a system of tallies, check marks, etc. to keep track of your place in the pattern. Write yourself helpful notes to remember if you ever revisit the pattern again., It's important to remember what sort of yarn you're using if you plan to throw away the wrapper. (You could actually just stick the wrapper onto the page.) It's good to write down the needles you used for future reference., If the pattern you're using doesn't explain all the abbreviations they use completely, look them up and write yourself a little explanation so you don't waste time looking them up while you're knitting., You can also use fun pens and maybe a sticker or a piece of yarn from each project, so your journal becomes really fun and sort of like a scrapbook., How much yarn did it take? What would you have done differently a second time around? What did you think of that brand of yarn? All of this is helpful for future knitting projects.	Find or buy a notebook or writing pad and stash it in your knitting bag or basket.  Grab a pen or pencil, then keep it with the notebook at all times.  Put the title of the pattern at the top of the page so you won't lose track of your project.  Record information about your needles and yarn.  Use the journal to keep track of abbreviations.  Tape or paste pictures into the journal.  Record final details once you've finished the project.

If it is a british guy getting kidnapped, research british accents, and how to act more fearful.	If you are allowed to choose your own monologue, try picking one from your favorite movie or book. If you are assigned a monologue, try making it your own. Do research on what the monologue talks about.
People don't typically hang out around the recording studio, and you might have some trouble getting close by the kinds of studios the boys record in, but if you can find out when and where they've got studio time booked, you might be able to meet them when they're taking a break.  Most of the band members live in London, which means that you can up your chances of meeting them if you hang out in the neighborhoods they hang out in.   Harry Styles has a condo in London, Louis Tomlinson has a house in North London, and Liam Payne has apparently been shopping for houses in the Primrose Hill sections of London. If you can find out where they live specifically, you can visit coffee shops or other hangouts nearby and hope to spot them.  By keeping up with all the latest fan details, you can stay one step ahead of other fans and hope to run into the boys when they head out for a bite to eat on tour or go clubbing.	Find out when they're recording. Hang out in their neighborhood. Find out where they might be going on tour.
Whatever your preferred form of art, adding artwork to your home is a great way to attract attention and keep people enthralled. Paintings, pictures, photos and sculptures can all enhance the home environment.

When you know how to hold the strings to make notes and chords, the next step is to get your strumming down. Strumming is basic, and can be done a multitude of ways. Essentially, run your strumming hand quickly over the strings and over the hollow space to create sound. You can use your fingertips, fingernails, or a guitar pick to strum, but most people find it easiest to start with a pick..          There are many different strumming patterns, but two of the most basic are running your hand back and forth over the strings in a fast-pace, or running them in one direction only. If you are playing a chord, don’t feel obligated to strum all of the strings. Instead, you can choose to strum only the strings which you need to play the chord. Don’t worry about getting your strumming pattern fixated until you can play chords accurately. It is better to be slow and strumming to start and play accurate chords, than to strum quickly but have your fingers in the wrong place or playing notes poorly. Plucking strings is when you pick at individual strings, and is generally a little more difficult for beginners. Reserve plucking for a time after you’ve already developed basic strumming skills.  Rhythm comes with practice, and is very difficult to get at first. When you are first learning chords, you will likely have to pause multiple times to put your fingers in the right position, which is fine. Over time though, develop rhythm with your strumming to give your music a better sound. Using a metronome ensures you're always practice perfectly on time.  Although putting together chords and strumming in a timely manner can take some time to master, the best way to practice both is to play songs that you know. Many beginning guitar books offer children's songs to start, but you can learn popular songs as well.          Check out this collection of 10 beginner songs on Wikihow.  Search online for “guitar tabs” to get the music to play your favorite guitar songs. These will tell you the chord that needs to be played, and on some sites you will be shown how to play that specific chord as well.  By far the most important thing you can do when learning how to play the guitar, is to practice on a regular basis. This will help you to become accustomed to the shape your hands must take, strumming and rhythm, and learning new songs. Remember that 20-30 minutes every day is a much better way to learn than playing three hours, but only on Saturdays.

Ask your acting teachers, colleagues and friends if they know of any upcoming projects in your area. These can be your best first resource. An acting coach or teacher will know what parts you are suited for and can give you valuable contacts. Your own professional network will be able to recommend you to casting directors and local agents.  You can find them in your local newspapers, websites, TV, radios and elsewhere.Many TV networks post on their websites when they have casting calls for shows or other projects Theater auditions and castings are often published in theater magazines or local newspapers. Look in major newspapers for large cities. You will have better luck finding opportunities in large metropolitan areas with big entertainment industries.  Facebook is a great resource for getting auditions. Event pages are often used to announce open casting calls and auditions. These can be a good resource for both film, tv, and theater. Look at agents pages or find specific project pages on Facebook. Sometimes, audition information will be posted there. You can also find casting calls and auditions on Twitter and Craigslist. You might have more luck finding auditions and acting opportunities if you live closer to a large city with an entertainment industry.  At first go to the sites, sign up and post your head shots. Some examples of these sites include www.exploretalent.com, www.laauditions.com, www.actoraccess.com, or www. backstage.com. Make sure your profile is distinct, detailed, and has multiple headshots. Most of these sites will send you emails or alerts when a project is holding auditions or open casting for a part. Be wary of using these sites as your only resource. Many of them charge a fee with minimal return. These can be a very good tool for researching projects that are happening locally.  Most films that are looking for extras will advertise through your city's film office. The film office will also have a list of current projects, permits and contacts. This can help you do some more research and contact casting directors. The film office might also offer information on acting classes and workshops to allow you to practice your craft.	Use your own contacts. Try out some casting calls. Use social media. Create an account on audition websites. Contact your local film office.These can be excellent resources for searching for auditions and casting calls.
Take off the doorknob and any other hardware. For a real antique look, you can replace these with brass. Either way, set them aside so you can work on the door itself.  Lay the door on a sturdy horizontal surface. Sand with medium-grit, then fine-grit sandpaper to get it ready for painting. If the door has any old finish, sand through it to the bare wood.  Start with one or two base coats of latex paint. This will only be visible through the final coats of paint. Most people choose an ivory, yellow or orange color to imitate the highlights of mahogany or other expensive woods.          Let the paint dry according to instructions between coats and before moving on to the next step. Work in a well-ventilated area, over a drop cloth.  Tape around the edge of the first door panel you'll be working on. Think of each panel as a separate piece of wood, with its own grain pattern. Push the tape down firmly to prevent paint bleeding underneath it.  Mix one part latex paint, one part latex glaze, and one part water.Use a darker wood shade than you did for the base coat, to create contrast.  This thin paint/glaze mixture allows you to create the appearance of fine fabric, with the lighter highlights showing through. Brush it lightly over the panel, then drag a wide brush through it to create long, straight lines.          Let dry before you continue. You may paint other areas of the door while you wait, but make sure not to tape over wet paint.  Wood glaze is the easiest way to achieve a classy antique look. Choose a tinted glaze with a rich wood tone. Mix it with water according to the instructions, then brush it lightly over the door. Immediately wipe off excess with a dry cloth.         Additional applications can be used to highlight crevices and detail work if desired.Create custom tints by mixing latex paint with your glaze. Let the glaze dry, then paint on a clear satin finish.  Alternatively, apply a second coat of strié mix with a darker tint. Pull a wood-graining tool over this lightly, rocking it back and forth. This creates a wood grain pattern that reveals the two lighter coats underneath.]          Use the edges of the tool next to the knots to create a different type of wood grain next to the knots. Sweep a dry brush over any portions of the grain that are too dark. Vary the direction of the wood grain in different parts of the door for a more natural appearance.  Once the door is dry, apply a clear finish to protect it.	Remove the hardware. Sand the door. Paint the door with a highlight color. Tape the edge of a panel with painter's tape. Create the strié mix. Paint lightly with the strié technique. Consider a simple wood glaze. Create a faux wood grain instead. Protect your door with a clear finish. Finished.
Pesticides become less effective as grasshoppers get older—plus, they've likely reproduced by then.  Natural insecticides with Neem as the active ingredient will kill grasshoppers. Neem trees are common in the Indian subcontinent and are prized in the villages where they occur. The leaves are a natural disinfectant and insecticide. Toothpaste made with Neem extract is available in the U.S. and is effective against mouth sores, plus it keeps grasshoppers out of your mouth.  There's a product called "Ecobran" that only affects grasshoppers and their close relatives. It doesn't affect other insects or birds. Go to ecobran.com.   Ecobran uses carbaryl, an organophosphate. It is a good product for small landowners fighting grasshoppers, easy to use, and has minimal impact on beneficial insects compared to other formulations of carbaryl.	Do it soon. Look for Neem. Try Ecobran.
There are three main type of chard that you can plant: white-stemmed, colored, and perpetual. White-stemmed chard is usually the most productive, but colored chard are the most attractive ornamental option. Perpetual varieties, which have a spinach-like taste, typically remain compact, so they’re ideal for small or container gardens.White-stemmed varieties, such as ‘Fordhook Giant’ and ‘Silverado,’ are usually more tolerant of both heat and cold than other types of chard. Colored varieties, such as ‘Pink Passion,’ ‘Golden Sunrise,’ and ‘Orange Fantasia,’ come in shades of red, pink, yellow, and orange, and usually grow quite tall. You can find some seeds and seedlings that only feature a single shade and others that offer a mixture of colors. Colored varieties of chard are usually the least cold hardy, so they work best in warm to mild climates. Perpetual varieties, such as ‘Perpetual’ and ‘Verde da Taglio’, provide mild tasting leaves over a more prolonged growing season. They tolerate heat pretty well, so they're a good option for warmer climates.; , When you’re planting chard, you can either start from seeds or seedlings, which are young plants that you can purchase from your local nursery. The obvious benefit of planting chard from seedlings is that you don’t have to wait as long for the plant to develop, so you can enjoy your chard more quickly. On the other hand, planting chard from seeds is less expensive and you usually have a wider range of varieties to choose from.In a warm or mild climate, you shouldn’t run into much planting your chard as seeds. In climates where you go from a warm season to a cold season very quickly, you are usually better off planting your chard from seedlings.  If you decide to plant your chard as seeds, you’ll likely find packets that contain a mixture of colored chard. However, you can customize your chard by combining different colors yourself to get the exact combination that you want. Purchase packets of seeds for different colors, such as pink and orange, and mix them together before planting.You can also mix white-stemmed varieties with colored chard for a striking contrast in your garden.  You can plant chard in either the spring or the fall depending on your preference. If you’re opting for a spring harvest, plant the chard two to three weeks before the last frost. For a fall harvest, you can plant as early as late summer but no later than 40 days before the first frost.A spring planting usually provides a harvest through the spring, summer, and fall. If you plant in both the spring and the fall, you can have a chard harvest virtually year round.  When you’re selecting a spot in your garden to plant chard, it’s important to consider the amount of sunlight that the plants will receive. In early spring and fall, when the weather tends to be cooler, chard prefers full sun. In the summer, when the weather is warmer, it prefers partial sun. However, keep in mind that chard usually tolerates heat fairly well, so it can work well in a sunny section of your garden.Chard grows well in containers, so if you don’t have the right spot for it in your garden, consider planting it in a pot or planter.  For chard to grow well, it needs properly prepared soil. Several weeks before you plan to plant, dig through the area to remove any large rocks or weeds. You should also mix some compost and organic fertilizer, according to the rates on the label. Allow the mixture to sit for two to three weeks, so the soil has time to receive enough moisture and air.Chard grows best in soil with a pH between 6.0 and 6.8, so it’s slightly acidic. You can purchase a soil pH testing kit at your local garden supply store to check your garden.  For a successful harvest, you must space the chard properly. For seeds, plant them in rows approximately 3- to 6-inches apart. If you’re working with chard seedlings, place them in rows approximately 12-inches apart.When you’re creating the rows for the chard, make sure that they’re at least 18- to 24-inches apart. If you’re working with seedlings, you may need to thin them out to get the distance right. Use cuticle scissors to cut them rather than pulling them out.  When you’re ready to plant the chard in the soil, it’s important to place it at the right depth. For seeds, plant them approximately ½- to ¾-inch deep. If you’re working with seedlings, place them as deep as possible so the soil reaches the bottom of the leaves.Pay attention to how many seeds you plant too. The rule of thumb is eight to ten for every foot in the row., Consistent watering can help your chard grow better. Stick to a regular schedule, and apply approximately 1- to 1 ½-inches of water a week if it hasn’t rained. Place a rain gauge in your garden, so you know how much water the plants have received and adjust accordingly.Giving chard enough water can also help prevent it from getting a bitter taste. Adding an organic mulch around the plants can help them retain moisture so they grow well. Ground bark, compost, straw, or finely ground leaves work well as mulch.  You can usually tell when chard is ready to be harvested because the leaves are large enough to eat. The plants should be approximately 6- to 8-inches tall, though colored varieties may be taller. Use a sharp knife to cut off the outer leaves that are at least 1 ½-inches off the ground.If you’re careful when you harvest the chard, the young, inner leaves will continue grow in place of the outer leaves that you've removed, so a new harvest will be ready in the future. It typically takes anywhere from four to 12 weeks for chard to be ready for harvest.  Right after you harvest the chard, bring it inside to rinse it in cold water. The water helps cool the leaves, and remove any dirt, insects, or other debris from the surface. Take a moment to examine the chard after rinsing to ensure that the leaves are completely clean. Insects in particular can cling to the underside.Place the chard leaves on a piece of power towel after rinsing to soak up any excess water.  The best place to store your chard is in the refrigerator, where it can last for two to three days. Make sure that the leaves are completely dry, and place them inside a ventilated plastic bag. If possible, store them inside the crisper drawer.You can also freeze chard if you’re not going to use it right away. Place it in boiling water for two minutes and then immediately into ice water to blanch it. Dry thoroughly, and place in airtight containers or plastic freezer bags for freezing. It can last up to a year in the freezer.	Choose a type of chard. Decide on seeds or seedlings. Consider mixing seeds. Choose the right time. Find the right spot. Prepare the soil. Space the chard at the correct intervals. Plant at the right depth. Water regularly. Harvest when the plants are the right size. Rinse thoroughly. Store in refrigerator.
It's fine to go alone; you don't have to take someone, especially if you don't like them. But if you have wanted to hang out with a friend recently then you could go with them. Maybe you could plan a group trip there. Remember to make sure that your friends (if you're at school) don't talk about the trip to prevent unwanted guests showing up unexpectedly or people you haven't invited getting jealous. Remember to pick people that you want to go with, and people who will get along with each other. If they start arguing, it could turn the trip into a nightmare, or get you kicked out of the cinema for being too loud.  Pick a movie you like; It's no fun sitting through an hour and a half long film and being bored to death, or worse, scared to death. Have a look at the choices and pre-plan the film you want to see, especially if it hasn't come out yet. If you're going in a group, maybe get together beforehand to see what everyone thinks because you don't want them not enjoying themselves., You don't have to eat, but it's sometimes fun to break out the popcorn or pick 'n' mix. Only choose one of the options, because it can be uncomfortable being full and trying to focus on a film at the same time. You could go for a meal before, but that means that you probably shouldn't eat everything at the cinema. Make sure that what you are eating is what you want to eat because if the food is absolutely horrific then no one will be very pleased. If you're an indecisive person and are travelling with a group you should make the decision a few hours before to stop the rest of the group from getting bored, agitated or angry from waiting too long., Although cost can be a factor, time at which the movie is planned to be shown is yet another factor. True, a cinema is a cinema, but some cinemas are better quality or more local to your area. Look at the cinemas in your area and see which one is the best. If you're taking a group out then you should see which one is the most local to all of you- travelling long distances can cause various problems., Although some 2D movies have been made for 3D now, 3D will generally be more expensive, can make some people feel sick, not to mention the glasses making your nose feel funny and being just not the right size. With a group, see who doesn't like 3D. If even one person says they don't like 3D then go and see 2D instead. You don't want them vomiting in the middle of all the seats. If you have decided to see 3D, then remind everyone to take their own glasses., A lot of times during the day aren't suitable to go to the cinema in. Don't go before 11:30, and don't go after 6:00 unless it's a date. If you or a friend you're going with can't make it between these times then it's fine. You can either go at a different time or schedule for the holidays or a weekend., Even though the first part of every film is always trailers, you should get there 15 minutes before the film starts if you're going with a group so you can get any sweets or popcorn, tickets and other things before the film starts. Besides, missing the start of the film can cause confusion later on and is annoying to the people already in the cinema., If you're with a group, make sure they (and you) all turn off their phones. And seriously, not just because the cinema tells you to. Bright lights from the phone distract people from the film and sounds can make people miss a dramatic statement or a witty comment. This also why you should refrain from whispering.  Try to ignore any distractions around you and eliminate distractions so you can have a proper experience.  If you are, the chances are that people around you are too. This just means that you're having a great experience of the film. If you're with a group tell them so they can feel it too., The story is the basis of the actions you'll see, and which should drive the point "home" of whether or not a repeat performance should be attained.  If you start crying, it's ok. Just try not to make a big noise.  Let the movie on the cinema screen drive what you want to do with the movie till the end, if planned just right.	Decide who you are going to the cinema with. Decide which movie you are planning to attend. Pick out what you are going to eat (if you'd like) while watching the movie. Pick which cinema you will use to watch this movie. Decide between 2D and 3D films. Plan the time at which you'll be leaving the house to get to the cinema on time. Figure out your arrival time. Make sure to turn off any cellphones, beepers and other electronic devices (including any tablet PCs that you may have in your possession but concealed, as sometimes they may beep and annoy other guests sitting near you. Don't be afraid to gasp or laugh. Let the story captivate and move you. Try not to think about anything else.

You may, if you wish, disconnect only 1 of the 2 leads from the circuit., This information should be printed on the outside of the capacitor as well. Look for a number followed by a capital “V,” the symbol for “volt.”  , For a 25V capacitor, you could use a voltage of 9 volts, while for a 600V capacitor, you should use a voltage of at least 400 volts. Let the capacitor charge for a few seconds. Be sure to connect the positive (red) lead from the voltage source to the positive (longer) capacitor terminal and the negative (black) lead to the negative (shorter) terminal.   The greater the discrepancy between the capacitor’s voltage rating and the voltage you’re charging it with, the longer it will take to charge. Generally, the higher voltage of the power supply you have access to, the higher the voltage ratings of the capacitors you can test with ease.,, Connect the positive(red) lead to the positive (longer) terminal and the negative (black) lead to the negative (shorter) terminal.  This should be close to the voltage you supplied the capacitor with. If it isn’t, the capacitor is no good.   The capacitor will discharge its voltage into the voltmeter, causing its reading to drop back to zero the longer you have the leads connected. This is normal. Only if the initial reading is much lower than the expected voltage should you be concerned.	Disconnect the capacitor from its circuit. Check the capacitor’s voltage rating. Charge the capacitor with a known voltage less than, but close to, its rated voltage. Set your voltmeter to read DC voltage (if it’s capable of reading both AC and DC).  , Connect the voltmeter leads to the capacitor. Note the initial voltage reading.
Pick a game that you want to base your machinima on. Make sure it’s a game with a large following as the fans of the game are likely to be your initial audience. You should choose a game that you are fairly familiar with.Some popular games to use for machinima include:   Halo World of Warcraft The Sims Grand Theft Auto; , If you choose a computer game like “World of Warcraft”, the only hardware that you’ll need is your computer and a microphone. If the game you choose is for your console. You’ll need your computer, a microphone, your console and a video capture card.   Make sure your video capture card has a USB drive so it can connect to your computer. If your console has its own capture software, you won’t need a capture card.  Besides a copy of the game you’ll be using, you’ll also need video capturing software and video editing software. Download the programs you’ll need to create your machinima.   Fraps is a great video capture program you can use for computers. You can download it for free off the company’s website. Sony Vegas is a great program to use for editing your film.  Watch some other machinimas to get ideas for your own. What do you like about them? What don’t you like about them? Pay close attention to the way their characters move and interact.Study machinimas like:   Red vs. Blue Make Love, Not Warcraft A Law-Abiding Engineer  , What do you want your machinima to be about? Decide a tone for it. Take some time to figure out how you want your machinima to be perceived. The game you choose can help you make a decision. For instance, if your game has a science fiction theme, you’ll have plenty of science fiction animation to work with.   Your machinima can be a comedy. Your machinima can be dramatic. Your machinima can be an action thriller.  Choose where your story takes place. You’ll be somewhat limited in your selection using footage from a video game. Be thorough in creating the backstory for your setting. Your story may take place in:   A post-apocalyptic wasteland A friendly neighborhood An office environment A war zone  , Once again, you’ll be somewhat limited in creating characters using video game footage. Create a protagonist, an antagonist and the various other characters you’ll need to drive your story. Give them personalities and experiences that influence the way they interact with each other.   If you’re using a game like "World of Warcraft", you can build characters in the game to suit your specifications. If you’re using a game like "Halo", you may have a set amount of character models to choose from.  There has to be a reason for your story. Give your characters a reason to act. If you’re creating an episodic, make sure that as soon as one conflict resolves, there is another one waiting to take its place.Even a comedy has to have some sort of stakes or it will become boring.  You can make it witty but try to keep it simple. You’ll need to make your characters look like they are saying your words. You may have trouble matching big words with the characters’ vocal animations.   Include inside jokes about the game you’re using to appeal to your audience.  Your machinima will likely end up on the internet where it will be viewed by people with very short attention spans., You’ll want to sketch out the scenes you need to film. Make sure to account for all the characters that will be in your scene and everything you need them to interact with.This will save time when you are capturing footage.   If your character has to fall on a table, include it in your storyboard so you know to add it in your set.  Choose a group of actors to voice your characters. You can hold auditions or you can just use your friends.   One actor can play multiple characters if they can believably change their voice.  If you’re using Fraps, open your screen capture software on your computer. You’ll have to choose a "hot key" that will record footage when you press it. Choose a key that doesn’t interfere with the controls of the game.Open your game while you have Fraps open. When you want to record, press your "hot key" to start recording and again to stop. Do this until you’ve required all the necessary footage.   Fraps has a green screen function, so you may want to record your character actions separate from your setting. Make sure your frame rate is at least thirty frames per second so your video doesn’t lag. Choose a file where you can save your footage that you can identify later on. Title each bit of footage so you can remember which is which. Remember, the free version of Fraps will only record in thirty-second increments If you’re recording with a capture card, input your footage into your computer using Windows Movie Maker or another program.  In Fraps, go to "sound capture settings" under the "movies" tab. Choose to record from an external microphone. Choose a save file you’ll to store your audio. Then pick a "hot key" to record your sound.Try to match your footage as best you can with your voice recording so that everything fits together smoothly. It may take some time to make everything sound natural.   Unclick your operating system in Fraps when you’re recording voices. Unclick your microphone in Fraps when you’re recording game sounds. Make sure your microphone is enabled on your computer and is the default recording device. Right click your sound icon and go to "recording devices" and enable the microphone. Adjust the recording volume of your microphone and the in-game sounds by clicking on the sound icon and selecting "mixer".  Import your footage from Fraps into your editing software. Sync the audio to the footage and add whatever sound effects you need. Arrange your footage carefully so that it tells your story. Add cut scenes, background music and anything else you need to help the flow.   Because Fraps doesn’t compress files, you may need to convert your Fraps AVI files to a more manageable format like MPEG-2. Brorsoft video converter is a good app to download for this.Be sure to add a short intro with the name of your production company to get your name out there.	Choose a game. Get your hardware.

For adults, fevers aren’t dangerous until they get to be 103°F (39.4°C) or higher.Fevers between 103°F (39.4°C) and 106°F (41.1°C) can cause serious symptoms like confusion, irritability, hallucinations, convulsions or seizures, and severe dehydration.If you or someone you know is experiencing these symptoms, seek medical care right away.   If you have a fever that stays over 105°F (40.5°C) even after taking medicine, call for emergency help. This is a dangerously high temperature that requires treatment in a hospital if it cannot quickly be controlled at home., Call your doctor or go to the hospital if your fever is high or lasts longer than 3 days.Your doctor will try to diagnose your fever – if you seem to have a bacterial infection, they will prescribe an antibiotic.Monitor yourself for any unexplained symptoms, and seek emergency care if you experience any of the following:Severe headache, stiff neck, or pain when you bend forward. Swelling in your throat. A new skin rash, especially if it’s getting worse quickly. Sensitivity to light. Confusion, irritability, hallucinations, or severe weakness or listlessness. Vomiting that won’t stop. Chest pain or trouble breathing. Abdominal pain or pain when you pee. Muscle weakness, stumbling, slurred speech, or changes in your vision, touch, or hearing (this could indicate problems with your nerves, brain, or spinal cord). Seizure.  Mild fevers in children might indicate a more serious problem.If your child is feverish but is playing normally, is eating and drinking well, and has a normal skin color there’s little cause for concern.However, call or visit your child’s doctor if your child:Is listless, irritable, or won’t make eye contact with you. Vomits repeatedly or has other symptoms causing discomfort, like severe headache or stomachache. Has a fever after being left in a hot enclosed space like a car – seek emergency care right away. Has a fever lasting over 3 days (for kids 2 years and older) Has a seizure. It’s not abnormal for some children between the ages of 6 months and 5 years to have seizures if they have a higher temperature (these are called febrile seizures). These look scary for parents, but are usually harmless and do not indicate the child has a seizure disorder.Take the child to the doctor to determine the cause.  Call emergency services if the seizure lasts over 10 minutes., Infants who get a fever should be treated very cautiously. Take your baby to the doctor right away if they:Are 3 months or younger with a temperature of 100.4°F (38°C) or higher. Are ages 3-6 months with a fever over 102°F (38.9°C), or lower but are irritable or lethargic. Are 6 months to 2 years old and have a fever over 102°F (38.9°C) for longer than a day, or have other symptoms like a cold, cough, or diarrhea. A newborn with any fever or a low body temperature – infants don’t regulate their body temperature well and might get colder rather than warmer when they’re sick (under 97°F/36.1°C).	See your doctor for fevers over 103°F (39.4°C) or cognitive symptoms. Get medical assistance if you have other severe symptoms. Monitor your feverish child and seek care if necessary. Get medical help for feverish or symptomatic infants.
Make sure you can play the chords smoothly on their own. Strum each note of the chord individually, making sure they don't buzz or sound dead. If you can play each note in a chord cleanly every time, then changing chords will be easy. For this article, you can practice with any chords you want. For starters, you might work on shifting back and forth between a C and a G-major chord, two of guitars most common chords.           Open G-Major:  --1-- --0-- --0-- --0-- --2-- --3--    Open C-Major:  --0-- --1-- --0-- --2-- --3-- --X--  ; , Keep your wrist relaxed and lightly bent, as if you were cupping an apple in your hand. A relaxed wrist and fingers are key to moving quickly and easily along the fretboard. Your elbow should be tucked in, towards your ribs instead of splayed out, and your strumming hand should be able to move freely from the wrist.          A relaxed body can move more fluidly, smoothly, and quickly. Your fretting wrist (your left hand, for right-handed players) isn't kinked in front or behind of the neck, it is almost perpendicular to the frets, if not leaned a bit forward.  The small, hard spot on the tip of your finger is infinitely more precise than the fleshy pad. For faster, smoother transitions, always fret with the tips, curling your fingers away from the guitar to make it easier to land on the fingertips.          If you can't reach the frets comfortably with your fingertips, raise your left knee (for right-handed players) to lean the guitar upwards, classical style. The upward angle makes it easier to get your fingers around the neck.  If you're playing a note on the 3rd fret, you could technically be anywhere between the second and third frets with your fingers. But you'll get the most consistent, even sound if you're as close to the back of the 3rd fret as possible. Always try to creep closer to the fret you're trying to play for the cleanest transitions and chords.  Chords take a lot of strength for beginning guitarists. So don't get discouraged when you have difficulties at first -- all guitarists need to build the physical skills as well as the musical skills of playing. The best way to build strength is to keep playing.          Play a tough chord, remove your hand, then play the chord again. Keep repeating this on-off pattern to get faster and stronger with quick chords. Close your eyes to think about what a chord "feels" like. Can your fingers get there without your eyes?	Learn your chords cleanly, without transitions, before trying to switch between them. Loosen and relax your body into a comfortable, smooth playing position. Always fret with the tips of your fingers, not the pads. Keep your fingers as close to the back of the fret as possible. Keep practicing to build strength and stamina.
Unlike glow jars made using glow sticks, these ones never stop glowing. You just have to recharge them every so often by placing them under a bright light for at least 15 minutes. Here's a list of what you will need:   Jar (lid optional) Rubbing alcohol Glow-in-the-Dark paint Super fine scrapbooking glitter (optional)  , Even if the jar looks clean, there might still be some dust on it. Dry the jar off using a clean towel.  Soak a cotton ball with rubbing alcohol and wipe it down. The rubbing alcohol will get rid of any oil residue, which might prevent the paint from sticking.  You are putting the paint inside the jar, so it will be less-likely to get chipped or scratched. You don't need a lot of paint, because you will be shaking the jar to spread the paint around.   Consider adding some super fine scrapbooking glitter. This glitter will get mixed in with the paint, and give your jar an extra sparkle.  You can also tilt the jar and rotate it to help spread the paint around. If the paint doesn't spread very easily, it could be because you did not add enough paint or the paint is too thick. Try adding in a few more squirts of paint, or a few drops of warm water, then shake the jar again.  This way, the paint will dry faster, and you won't be wasting any paint.  Most paints will dry in about two hours, depending on how warm or humid it is. Refer to the label for more specific drying times, as each brand will be different.  The first coat you just did is likely very thin; this means that it won't glow very brightly Once the first coat dries, simply pour more paint into the jar and pour the excess out as before. Let each coat dry completely before adding another one.  Because this jar doesn't have anything that could spill out of it, it doesn't really need a lid. On the other hand, a lid will help keep the jar clean and dust-free on the inside; it will also help protect the paint.  Glow-in-the-dark paint does not need a black light in order to glow, but it does need to be charged. Once the glow starts to fade, all you have to do is charge it for another 15 minutes under a bright light.	Gather your supplies. Wash the jar using soap and warm water. Wipe down the inside of the jar with rubbing alcohol. Add a few squirts of paint into the jar. Close the lid and shake the jar until the paint covers the inside. Open the jar and pour the excess paint back into the bottle. Wait for the paint to dry. Consider doing one to two more coats for a more intense glow. Close the jar, if you want. Leave the jar under a bright light for at least 15 minutes before using it.
Choose the first one from the mother plant. Cut away the stem to the next runner.  Use a bulb planter to make it easier to put the flower pot in the soil––use it to make a round hole in the garden soil, about 6 inches (15cm) deep and 4 inches (10cm) wide. Wiggle or open the planter in the soil to make a wider hole. , Turn the slot of the pot towards the mother strawberry plant.  Strew some earth from the bulb planter into the hole. Then strew some more manure or compost into the hole. Then strew the rest of the earth from the bulb planter into the hole. Press gently on the earth in the pot. Add some garden earth in the hole when desired.  Fix the runner in the slot.	Select a runner. Shift the runner aside. Take the bulb planter with garden earth out of the soil.  , Put a bottomless flower pot in the hole in the soil. Strew some manure or compost into the hole. Lay the runner on the earth in the flower pot. Water the runner and the soil in the flower pot.
; , Place them one to two at a time on the wood on each side, and tape them down or clamp them to your workplace. If you wish, you may tape near the ends of the string instead of estimating the length from the nut to the bridge.  You will need to get your fingers in between the strings, it is recommended you seat the strings 1 to 4 inches apart and stretch them so they do not touch the workplace underneath. Use your guitar neck as a reference.  To do so, it is best to swab a drop of glue on your finger and rub it into your fingers with some water. It should feel like the same as liquefied soap, and have your towels ready.  With the watered down glue on your fingers, coat the string as you would be using a handrail, but going back and forth to get an even coating. Once you have made 5-6 swipes, get all the droplets of glue off the string and wait for the glue to dry. Set up another workstation if you need to, and continue on until all of your selected strings are coated.  You may sacrifice a little of your sound when you coat your strings, but it is a better outcome than dirt-filled, grimy, and rusted strings. If you so wish, coat the strings once again to have a different feel to the strings.	Gather your materials, listed below. Arrange the strings. Have distance from the workplace and other strings. Mix the glue and water. Coat the strings. Inspect the quality.
Take the cuttings during the warm growing season, or roots may fail to form. Cuttings have the best chance to become established if you cut them early, in springtime, but if you want additional flowers, you may wait until early or mid summer, then take the cuttings after the plant has bloomed.Waiting later than mid summer is not recommended unless you live in an area with late or no frosts, as the plant needs at least six weeks to grow roots before the ground freezes., "Nodes" are the clumps on a branch from which a cluster of leaves sprout. Select a young branch, low on the plant, with at least two nodes. There are two different methods of selecting a branch:    Softwood cuttings use only soft, new-growth material from this year, that has not yet become brown and woody. These cuttings will grow fastest, but are only usable if the soft material is at least 5 in. (12 cm) long, and includes at least two leafy nodes.Hardwood cuttings include woody, brown stem material, but must also have at least an inch or two (2.5–5 cm) of soft, new growth at the tip. These require a root stimulator to encourage root growth, available at a gardening store.  A root stimulator is necessary for growing hardwood cuttings. It is optional for softwood cuttings, since the young stem will grow roots without it. A root simulator may be useful for a softwood cutting if you removed it from the mother plant late, less than six weeks before the first expected frost.   Check the label and ingredients of a root stimulator before purchasing. Select a root stimulator that contains a root hormone, not just fertilizer and vitamin B1., Prepare a seed starting tray or small flowerpots to place the cuttings in for the first few weeks after cutting. Because plants without roots are sensitive to both drought and excessive moisture, use a special mix of 50% organic compost and 50% perlite to retain water at the correct level.Similar mixes sold at gardening stores can be used instead, such as a mix of sphagnum moss and perlite.   Terra cotta flowerpots are preferable to plastic ones due to their "breathability," especially if you soak the flowerpot in water overnight before continuing to the next step below., Sharpen and clean a knife if necessary, to prepare for a tidy cut with low chance of infection. Slice off the selected branch just below a leafy node, removing a cutting at least 5 in. (13 cm) long, including at least two leafy nodes. The longer the cutting is, and the more nodes it has, the more likely it is to be successful.   Using scissors is not recommended, as they may pinch the stem and make it more difficult for roots to emerge., Leave the top cluster of leaves alone, as they will provide energy for the new plant. Use your knife to cut all other leaves off the plant, so it directs its energy at root development rather than excessive foliage growth.Be careful not to damage the bark while removing the leaves.  Follow the instructions on the label of the root stimulator to dilute it to the correct strength, if your root stimulator is concentrated or in powdered form. Dip the bottom ¾ inch (2 cm) of the cutting, at the cut end, into the prepared root stimulator solution.This step is required for hardwood cuttings, and optional for softwood cuttings, as described in the steps above.  Plant the cuttings in the containers you prepared earlier, just deep enough to keep them steady. Give them a generous quantity of water immediately after planting, relative to the small size of the container.  Overwatering is a common mistake for new lavender cuttings. After the initial soaking, only water the cuttings when the soil begins to dry out, not when the soil is still moist.Shade will help minimize damage from the stress of transplanting for the first several days, but after this the plant can be moved incrementally to brighter environments.   Greenhouse environments may be too damp for lavender cuttings.However, if the cutting is looking limp or dry after one or two days, moving it to a greenhouse or under a plastic bag may help it retain moisture until it develops roots., After at least three weeks, and more commonly six weeks or more, strong roots will have developed in the small pot or starting tray. Once the roots have bound the soil together in the container, you can move this soil and the lavender plant into a larger flowerpot or flowerbed.Plant in rich, well-draining soil and care for it as you would any lavender plant.	Begin in spring or summer. Select a branch with at least two leafy nodes. Acquire a root stimulator (sometimes optional). Prepare small pots or a starting tray of special soil. Cut the branch with a sharp, clean knife. Cut off all but the top cluster of leaves. Dip the base of the cutting in a root stimulator (sometimes optional). Plant the cuttings in the prepared containers, and water thoroughly. Keep damp and shaded, but gradually expose to less water and more sun. Transplant into a larger pot or the ground once roots develop.
There are many different types of gardens and uses for a garden, so think about what your ideal type of garden would provide. Some of the different types of gardens include:Vegetable garden. This may be the most popular and practical type of garden. By growing your own vegetables, you can save money and increase the amount of fresh vegetables you eat.  Flower garden. A flower garden adds beauty to your yard and it can be a relaxing escape for you. If you are mainly interested in beautifying your property, then a flower garden may be the best choice.  Butterfly garden. You cannot grow butterflies, but you can plant flowers that will attract them to your yard. This can be a great type of garden to plan with kids.  Wildlife garden. A wildlife garden is one that helps to support the animals in your area by providing them with sources of food and shelter.; , If you have lots of space, then you can plant a garden in the ground. If you have limited space or simply do not want to plant in the ground, then you can also plant a garden in containers. You can grow a variety of different plants in pots and keep them on a patio or in a sunny spot of your yard. Some plants even thrive in containers indoors, so using containers may also be ideal if you live in an apartment.If you live in an area with good soil that is not too rocky or sandy, then growing your garden in-ground is a good option. If growing your garden in-ground is not a viable choice, then consider buying containers to grow your plants in or building above-ground beds. Above ground beds are great because they are easier on your back and can be moved around your yard if desired. If you are limited on space, but still want to have your garden outside, then you can grow a vertical garden. These types of gardens use small planters or stacked crates and upright-growing plants.  Most plants require around 6 to 8 hours of full sun to thrive. If you do not have an area that will provide this much sun, then you can still plant a garden. You will just have to choose plants that thrive in the shade or with less sun.Try checking the area where you plan to grow your garden a few times per day on a sunny day to see how long the sun is shining in that area. For example, you could check at 7am, 11am, 2pm, and 5pm, and make a note if the sun is shining on that area around that time. If the sun is shining on an area during two or three of your checks, then sun-loving plants will probably thrive there.	Decide what you want to grow or do with your garden. Consider how much space you have available. Determine how much sun your plants will get.
It is essential to have the person try on the article of clothing for a fitting to allow you to pin it to the correct length.; , Place them about 3 inches (7.5 cm) apart all the way around the material. Turn it inward as you put in the pins.  Take the item off carefully to avoid scraping pins on your model.  Make sure that the thread matches the color of the material as closely as possible.  This provides the strength needed for a hem; the hem takes a lot of punishment from daily wear. (To double the thread, put it through the needle and bring both ends together, tie them in a knot.)  , If the clothing is extremely long, measure and cut some of the excess material off, but leave about 2 inches (5 cm). Finish the raw edge of the fabric so that it does not fray. If you want to let the material out later, simply fold it over a few times, making an edge about two or three inches thick.  Take up as little fabric as possible with the needle on each stitch. Try to place stitches about 1/2 inch (1.5 cm) apart. You can sew by hand or with a sewing machine, depending on which way suits you most.	Fit the article first. Place ball or flat-headed stick-pins around the hem. Remove the article of clothing. Thread a needle with thread. Double and knot the thread. Turn the article of clothing inside out. Sew around the pinned material.
They should be about hip's distance apart, as if you're walking as you normally would. The airwalk is all about your feet, so you don't have to worry about what to do with your arms or the rest of your body quite yet. If you've never tried this before, some people recommend that you sit with your feet apart to master the movements of your feet before standing.   To get a stronger sense of what your feet are doing, you can practice in front of a mirror or even film yourself or ask a friend to watch you.; , Let the foot hover there straight, without pointing your toes, at about a 45 degree angle from the ground, with your toes above your heel. Lift the foot up in the air, with your toes leading, as if you were stepping over a barrier that is about half a foot tall, except that your foot won't hit the ground when you step over it and will pull back instead.  Your legs should be straight and you shouldn't bend your knees at all when you do this. Just glide the foot back to where it started, with the heel dragging it back until it naturally touches the ground. Think of it as rocking your weight forward before you transition to the other foot.  When you do the airwalk, you should never have both feet be flat on the ground at the same time. When one foot is moving back, the other should be preparing to move forward. It can take a little while to get into the rhythm. Just remember what we said about it being like riding a bicycle — when you're riding a bike, your feet are always in constant motion, too. If you stop one of them, then you'll stall.  Now, just do what you did with the other foot — lift your other foot forward, with the toe leading, as if you were stepping over a short barrier, and then drag it back, as if a string were attached to your heel and was slowly dragging it back. As the forward foot moves back, the other foot should prepare to move forward by lifting up on its toes.  Just keep doing the airwalk by raising one foot at a time and moving forward for as long as you like. You can start by practicing in place and then slowly moving forward, so you're moving forward at a much slower pace than you would if you were walking, as if you're walking on air or are having to move forward in a low-gravity situation.   When you move forward, try to form a "V" shape with your feet as they transition. So, when the foot that is up in the air moves back to meet the other, the heel of that foot should land where the toe of the other foot is pointed, so they create a "V" together as the pointed foot moves forward, and so on. This will keep you moving forward at the same pace.  It can take some practice to get this move down, but it'll be worth it. It can also be easier to learn the moonwalk first, before you get the airwalk down, since some people think the airwalk is a little bit trickier. Once you master the airwalk, you can work on airwalking and then transitioning to the moonwalk and back to the airwalk again. You can also work on gliding, which will use somewhat similar techniques, except you'll be moving from side to side.   As you get more comfortable with the airwalk, you can wave your shoulders a bit, and get your arms into it. Just move your arms forward and back, just as you would if you were walking forward normally, except at a slower pace to sync up with your feet. Remember to keep the movement as fluid as possible, so it looks like you're walking on air.  Once you've got the airwalk down, you can add this small variation to make the movement more interesting. All you have to do is take the foot that is pointed on its toes, ready to move forward, move it forward, tap its toes on the ground, and then do the normal airwalking move, where the foot moves forward with the toes leading up above the heel. Then, move the foot back and do the same with the other foot, tapping its toes on the ground in front of it before it also moves forward.  Another thing you can do is to tap the heel of each foot, and then its toe, before you take a step forward. If you've mastered being able to tap each toe once before you move forward, then you should be able to tap the heel and then the toe of each foot as it takes a step without a problem. Watch yourself in the mirror to make sure that you've got the rhythm down.  Once you become a master at the airwalk, you can work on walking forward for about thirty seconds or so, and then transitioning into the moonwalk, so you walk backwards to the place where you started. Then you can go right back into the airwalk, moving forward again, and then move backward using the moonwalk whenever you feel like it.   The trickiest part will be the transition, and you have to work on not stalling or stopping, but transitioning right from moving forward to moving backward, and vice versa.	Stand with your feet side by side. Move one foot straight in the air in front of the other foot. As your weight transfers to the toes of that foot, glide it back to its original position. When the first foot moves back to its original position, the other foot should point up on its toes. Move the other foot up and forward and repeat. Keep moving forward. Practice. Tap your toes with each step. Tap your heel and toe with each step. Do the airwalk along with the moonwalk.
You will find that there are many different bands around the world, each with different styles. Many thrash metal bands have influenced other metal sub-genres.; , These four bands were among the pioneers of thrash metal and many bands spawned after. Start with less intense bands like Anthrax and Metallica. If your ears are not used to louder sounds, don't start with a band like Kreator or Sodom. Thrash metal songs usually use fast guitar riffs with shredding-style guitar solos.  The stereotype about thrash metal fans being aggressive and violent is not true. Remember that it's all about the music and you don't have to grow long hair and change the way you look.  You'll realize the guitar riffs are fast and difficult to play and compose. Bass and drum playing is also difficult, due to the genre's high speed. In fact some Thrash Metal drummers like Dave Lombardo (Slayer) and Charlie Benante (Anthrax) are regarded as some of the best drummers in heavy metal.  Even if it's on a TV screen, observe how the group members manipulate the instruments. If you've ever tried to play those instruments yourself, you'll probably be amazed with how skillfully they play. It takes practice, and dedication, which challenges the stereotype of metalheads being lazy and careless. You might also be surprised about how energetic some of the performers are.  That includes the riffs, drums, solos, and lyrics. Writing your own music demonstrates another dimension of instrumental mastery and talent, as well as making the music more personal and less manufactured.  Thrash metal lyrics and themes demonstrate rebellion and anger. Topics such as politics, war, and violence are common in thrash metal. The fact that thrash metal musicians aren’t afraid to talk about anything from ANY point of view in their music lyrics is probably the main reason that many people avoid thrash metal. And NOTE: Few Thrash Metal bands have Satanic/Anti-Christian lyrics, and if you’re seriously against that kind of stuff, Slayer are bands to avoid. Although some bands use satanic lyrics in songs, most are not actually Satanists including Slayer. And use this rule for the lyrics: The more over-the-top the lyrics are, the less seriously you should take them.  Thrash vocals are usually very aggressive and sometimes angry sounding, but they are still understandable.  Many thrash metal bands use death metal, black metal, and hardcore in their music. Thrash metal with even more hardcore elements than standard thrash is called crossover thrash or crossover for short. Its overall sound is more hardcore-influenced than traditional thrash metal, while more melodic than traditional hardcore and thrashcore. Crossover is often more aggressive and simpler than traditional thrash metal due to the heavier hardcore influence. There is even a resurgence of thrash bands! Some Thrash band have even re-recorded old material, you may find it more to your liking, since they have better production value(i.e. First Strike Still Deadly - Testament / Let There Be Blood - Exodus).  Try not to focus on just one or two bands, listening to many bands will give you a better understanding of the genre. Here is a basic list of recommended albums (only one from each band):   ...And Justice For All - Metallica Rust in Peace - Megadeth Reign In Blood - Slayer Welcome To Hell - Venom Fistful of Metal and Spreading the Disease - Anthrax Practice What You Preach - Testament Bonded By Blood - Exodus Indulgence/Abstract Reality - Nasty Savage Time Does Not Heal - Dark Angel Release From Agony - Destruction Solitary Solitude - Meliah Rage Beneath the Remains - Sepultura Mass Illusion - Korzus The Years Of Decay - Overkill Pleasure To Kill - Kreator Handle With Care - Nuclear Assault Tortured Existence - Demolition Hammer Agent Orange - Sodom Beyond the Permafrost - Skeleton-witch Speak English or Die - S.O.D Alice in Hell - Annihilator Hazardous Mutation - Municipal Waste The Blackening - Machine Head The Onslaught - Lazarus A.D. Enter the Grave - Evile Time is Up - Havok Grand Feast For Vultures - Blood Tsunami Ascendancy - Trivium(for new generation thrash lovers)	Learn about the history and characteristics of thrash metal. Learn about the "Big Four" of thrash: Metallica, Megadeth, Anthrax and Slayer. Don't listen to thrash metal because you think it's cool. Try playing a thrash metal song on an instrument. Watch a live thrash metal performance. Remember that in thrash metal, unlike many other genres, each band almost always writes their own music. Understand the context and subject matter. Unlike older forms of heavy metal and classic metal, thrash metal vocals are not usually "sung" and don't always rhyme. Know the subgenres of thrash metal. Listen to various albums from different bands.
Check with your owner’s manual to find the right one. If you cannot find the correct EGR there, check a parts manual or with an associate at an auto parts stores., Wait for several hours before you begin working on your vehicle. You can injure yourself very easily while working on a hot engine so let it set a few hours., Use a wrench to loosen the clamps on the battery’s two terminals. Be sure to wait at least 5 minutes after disconnecting the battery before you begin working on the engine. You want the system to discharge completely.   Always wear the appropriate safety gear before working on your engine.  The EGR is usually located on either the top or backside of the engine. Consult your owner’s manual if you need help finding it.  Twist and pull each line until they slide off the EGR valve. Each line connects with a specific port. Label each one so that you can easily reconnect them. , The electrical cable is located on top of the EGR valve. Grab the electrical cable with your hands and pull it.   If the electrical cable is held in by a clip or clamp, use a flat-bladed screwdriver to press it down and release it.  Use lubricant spray on the bolts because they are usually very tight.  Now that you removed the bolts, use your hands to remove the valve from its mount.   Inspect the valve for signs of carbon buildup. Sometimes this buildup causes the valve to malfunction. If you find buildup, clean it off and reinstall the valve. Test the valve again to see if it works after cleaning it.  Use a scratch awl or something similar to remove any carbon buildup. Clean any debris or building in the gasket case.   Use carburetor or intake cleaner to help remove the carbon.  Thread the bolts through the EGR and gasket onto the mount with your hands first. Then use a socket wrench with a swivel extension to tighten the mounting bolts when you seat the EGR valve in the engine.   When purchasing a new valve, see if it comes with a new gasket. You will have to purchase one if it doesn’t.  Plug the cable back into the top of the EGR valve using your hands.  Reattach the line with using your hands. Make sure that it’s tight to prevent leaks.  Attach the engine leads to the battery terminals. Use a wrench to tighten the bolts.  If you used a scan tool to test your EGR valve, clear any error codes related to the valve. Then test again to see if any error codes appear.  Start your engine and listen for any leaks near the EGR valve. The two possible places leaks might occur will be with the vacuum hose or exhaust. Drive the vehicle to make sure that it runs correctly. Pay close attention to the idling and gas mileage of your vehicle as poor performance in these areas indicate that the EGR valve is faulty.	Purchase the correct EGR valve for the make and model of your vehicle. Let your engine cool. Disconnect the battery. Locate the EGR. Disconnect the vacuum line. Disconnect the electrical cable. Use a wrench to remove the bolts on the EGR valve's mount. Take out the old EGR valve. Clean the valve base and passages. Install the new EGR valve. Reconnect the electrical cable. Hook up the vacuum line. Reconnect the battery. Clear your scan tool. Listen for leaks.
Hot peppers have a compound in them called capsaicin. Mammals are sensitive to capsaicin, and the compound registers on their taste buds as "hot" and serves as an irritant. This spray is considered to be effective for such garden animal pests as deer, rabbits, voles, squirrels, possums and insects.; ,,, Then turn off the heat and let it cool to room temperature. , Label it so that anyone coming across it knows what the contents are; it's also a good idea to add the date to it.   For added sticking power, you might like to add a few drops of pure dish soap to the liquid as well.  Always wear gloves and eye protection before using this spray––it can burn your skin and eyes if it touches them and it's painful. Be sure to spray the entire plant, for full protection.   Shake before using. Use the spray early morning or in the evening––if sprayed in the heat of the day, it may burn the plants.If you're not sure how sensitive plants will cope, test a small area first. Wait four days and if the plant doesn't react, then using the spray on it should be okay.Do not spray this on windy days. The back spray may hit you or go anywhere but on the plants you're trying to protect. As mentioned earlier, do not spray anywhere near waterways, lakes or ponds.  It will also need to be reapplied after rain.	Understand how the spray works. Take one quart (950ml) of water and put it in a pot.  , Take one-half cup of dried hot peppers (available at most Asian groceries), and put them in the pot.  , Bring the pot of water and peppers to just barely boiling. Strain out the peppers and throw them away.  , Put the liquid into a spray bottle. Spray it on the plants you want to protect. Re-spray every week for maximum benefit.
Your organizational efforts will go to waste if your child's toy collection outgrows them. Balance toys the child receives with toys he/she gives away., For instance, a playroom rule could be that only five toys can be out at a time, or that the room must be cleaned up before bedtime or leaving the house. Hold your child accountable for this; you have set up a simple system for them to follow, so they should follow it.,	Avoid showering your kid(s) in toys. Establish rules about cleaning up.Enjoy seeing your child's free, organized play space.
If you’re upgrading your towels, make sure you buy a wide variety of sizes. Every bathroom should be equipped with bath towels, hand towels and face cloths, at the bare minimum.Bath towels are generally 27”x52” (69 x 132cm) and are preferred for wiping down after showers. Bath sheets are 35”x60” (89 x 152cm) and are ideal for people who prefer a bit more towel coverage after a shower. Hand towels are 16”x30” (41 x 76cm) and are everyday towels for wiping hands. Face or wash cloths are 13”x13” (33 x 33cm) and are ideal for spot cleaning, in and out of the shower. If you’re feeling extra ambitious, add bath sheets and finger towels to your shopping list. Buy at least four of each size towel. You’ll want to have extras in case your towels are in the wash, or for when you have guests visiting.  Bathmats are necessary for protecting your floors from shower moisture, but they can also be another source of color. Your bathmat should compliment your towel choices, but not replicate them exactly.If you are using patterned towels, buy a bathmat in one of your towel’s color tones. Do not select a bathmat that is not washable. There are some beautiful non-washable bathmats out there, but they’re not practical for most bathrooms. Only purchase a non-washable bathmat if you don’t expect anyone to actually use the bath or shower in that particular bathroom.  Top, seat covers and rug bases used to be very popular bathroom accessories, but they’re not terribly hygienic. Bathroom linens like these trap moisture, dust and bacteria and are therefore not recommended for use in your bathroom.Add some color around your toilet by adding some greenery in the form of a potted plant or succulent. If you’d like to add additional color by your toilet, hang some fun art across from the toilet (but not so high that your guests will have to break their necks to look at it).	Cover all your towel bases. Choose a bathmat. Skip toilet linens.
One of the easiest ways to distinguish between stars and planets in the night sky is by looking to see if the object twinkles or shimmers. This can usually be detected with the naked eye if you have a clear view of the sky and if you watch the sky for long enough.Stars twinkle and shimmer - hence, the song "Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star." Planets do not twinkle. They remain constant in their brightness and their overall appearance in the night sky. If viewed through a telescope, planets may appear to "wiggle" along the edges.Any object that blinks, twinkles, or shimmers is most likely a star. However, it could also be an aircraft if it is moving quickly across the night sky.; , Celestial objects are not fixed in the night sky. All celestial bodies move, but how those bodies move can be a good indication of whether they're stars or planets.Planets rise in the East and set in the West. They tend to follow a similar celestial path across our sky as the sun and moon. Stars move around in the night sky, but they do not rise or set. Instead, they orbit in a circular pattern around Polaris (the North Star). If the celestial object you see appears to move in a more-or-less straight line across the night sky, it is most likely a planet. Satellites also move across the night sky, but they do so much more quickly than planets. A planet may take hours or even weeks to cross the night sky, whereas a satellite can cross overhead in a matter of minutes.  Planets are always found along an imaginary belt across the night sky called the ecliptic. This belt is not actually a visible object, but careful observation will help you find the location where celestial objects are congregated. While stars may also appear along this invisible belt, they should be distinguishable by their shimmering appearance.Of the celestial bodies along the ecliptic, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn are significantly brighter than the surrounding stars. This is due to their proximity to the sun since their "brightness" is just reflected sunlight. The easiest way to find the ecliptic is to note the location and trajectory of the sun and moon in the sky relative to your location on the Earth. The sun's path across our sky is very close to the path of planets along the ecliptic., Not all planets are colorful. However, many of the most prominent planets in our night sky appear to have some type of coloration. This can help differentiate the planets from stars. While some people with exceptionally good vision may be able to detect subtle coloration, that coloration usually falls within the blueish white to yellowish white range.For most people, stars appear white to the naked eye.Mercury is typically gray or somewhat brownish in color.Venus appears pale yellow. Mars usually appears somewhere between pale pink and bright red. This is affected by the relative brightness or dimness of Mars, which changes on a two-year cycle.Jupiter appears orange with white bands. Saturn typically appears pale gold in color. Uranus and Neptune appear pale blue. However, they are not usually visible to the naked eye.  While planets and stars both light up the night sky, planets typically appear much brighter than many stars.Astronomers measure the relative brightness of celestial objects using the astronomical magnitude scale, with most of the planets falling in the range of objects that are easily visible to the naked eye.Planets reflect the bright light of our solar system's sun, which is relatively close to the earth. Stars, by contrast, emit their own light. While some stars may be much brighter and larger than our sun, these stars are much farther from earth than the planets in our solar system. Because of this, the planets (which reflect our sun's light) typically appear brighter from earth.  Whether you have poor night vision or are simply confused about the location of certain celestial bodies, a chart or guide can help you determine where to look. You can purchase star charts and planetary guides from a bookstore, print out free guides from the internet, or download a star/planetary guide app on your smartphone.Remember that star charts are usually only valid for a limited period of time (typically about one month). That's because the position of stars in the sky changes over time as the earth continues along its orbit. If you consult a star chart or planetary guide out in the field, make sure you use a dim red flashlight. These flashlights are designed to provide light without affecting your eyes' ability to adjust to the darkness.  If stargazing with the naked eye isn't getting you enough celestial body views, you may want to consider using a telescope or binoculars. These instruments can help assist your view by magnifying the area you look at. This can make visible objects clearer and can even bring objects invisible to the naked eye into your view.Some experts recommend getting familiar with celestial bodies using the naked eye, then trying binoculars, and finally moving up to using a telescope. This can help you get more acclimated to the visible bodies and their place in the night sky. Compare telescopes and binoculars online before you invest in one. Read the reviews written by people who have owned a given model by searching online for the model you're interested in.  Light pollution from urban areas can drastically limit your ability to see celestial bodies in the night sky. To really maximize visibility, you may want to consider visiting a dark-sky site.These designated sites have been identified by the International Dark-Sky Association (IDA) as places worth protecting against encroaching light pollution and urban development.Common dark-sky sites include state and national parks, though other dark-sky sites are surrounded by well-lit, well-developed regions. Check the IDA website to find a dark-sky site near you.  An occultation is when the moon passes between the Earth and a given star or planet, obstructing that celestial body's visibility. These obstructions happen somewhat regularly and can easily be planned around since their occurrence is predictable.Occultations may be visible from some locations on Earth and not from others. Check in advance to see whether an occultation is scheduled and whether your visibility will be significantly affected. You can find out about planned occultations by searching online or by consulting an astronomy guide. The international Occultation Timing Association publishes their predictions online for free., Light reflected off the moon can inhibit your ability to see stars and planets. If it is close to a full moon, you may have a hard time observing celestial bodies. For this reason, it's best to check on the current phase of the moon before venturing out to observe the night sky.If you aren't sure about the moon's current phase, you can consult an online guide to the moon's phases for free. The U.S. Navy's website allows you to check moon phases by date as far in advance as the year 2100., Knowing how to distinguish between stars and planets will only get you so far if the night sky is not very visible. Your ability to see celestial bodies can be limited by a number of factors, both man-made and naturally-occurring.Light pollution is one of the biggest limiting factors of night sky visibility. If you live in or near a metropolitan area, you will probably need to travel to a more rural area to increase visibility. Cloud cover and significant snow cover can both affect night sky visibility. If it's very cloudy or if the ground is significantly covered in snow, you may have a hard time seeing celestial bodies in the sky.  There are many other factors can also affect night sky visibility, including some that you might be inflicting upon yourself. For example, your level of alcohol consumption, your nicotine consumption, and your pupil dilation at the time of viewing can all affect your ability to see celestial bodies. These factors all affect your eyes' ability to adjust to the dark and identify stars and planets in the night sky.	Check if the object twinkles. Note whether the object rises and sets. Identify the ecliptic. Observe the color. Compare the relative brightness. Bring star charts and planetary guides. Get a good telescope or binoculars. Visit a dark-sky site. Check whether an occultation is scheduled. Identify the moon's phase. Find the right conditions. Avoid other limiting factors.
Don't speed up and slow down for no reason, don't make one turn fast and the next slow. Consistent driving, whether more aggressive or less, is the best way to allow other drivers to accurately predict what you're going to do next. Additionally drive consistent to the surrounding traffic. By driving inconsistently, you risk the general safety of others around you and you may also risk getting cited for one of many traffic violations.   Recognize that everything works best when traffic flows in a natural, balanced, and predictable way. This is the single most important concept behind not annoying other drivers.; , For example, if you are on a U.S. Interstate Highway with a speed limit of 65 mph (105 km/h), and the majority of traffic is averaging about 70, don't impede them by driving in the far left lane at 65 mph (105 km/h). Either match their speed or get over to the right lane and get out of their way.   Beware if you attempt to match their speed, you risk at least getting a traffic ticket for speeding and the officer is not likely going to accept the excuse that you were "just keeping speed with traffic", especially if you're the lead car. But this does not mean you should endanger yourself by slowing them down and risking a collision. In general, you should drive at or close to the speed limit unless conditions demand that all drivers slow down.  However, beware that turning on your hazard indicator while your vehicle is moving is unsafe and illegal in some places. If passing is difficult and you're holding up traffic, pull over from time to time to let others get by. They'll thank you for it (or at least will no longer be annoyed).  Ever. It's completely unnecessary, highly annoying and quite dangerous. Some people will have a psychological reaction to tailgating that will cause them to slow down, and some people will do it just to be mean. In fact, the DMV actually recommends slowing down if being tailgated so as to create a space cushion in case of emergency.   If the vehicle in front is traveling slowly in the passing lane, be patient. Do not flash your headlights while tailgating as this is viewed by many drivers as an act of aggressive driving and very rude. In certain areas of the United States, aggressive actions such as these are monitored by surveillance cameras and ticketed accordingly. If you have legitimate need to pass and there is only one lane per direction of traffic (i.e. the vehicle in front is going at an excessively slow speed and there is slightly heavy oncoming traffic) and you cannot pass naturally, back off to a safe distance (if you aren't already) and briefly flash your lights (no more than twice should be sufficient). At this point, the driver in the vehicle ahead may understand your intentions better and pull off slightly to allow you to pass with greater ease, if not just continue attempting to pass naturally while not tailgating. If you find yourself catching up to vehicles ahead of you continually, then you're probably going too fast relative to traffic around you.  Should this be the case, let them pass you first. Once they have passed you, continue to pass the other vehicle as planned should conditions allow you to both pass. Always drive sufficiently faster than the vehicle you overtake and return to the right lane as soon as possible.   Semi trucks have much bigger blind spots. You might think the driver can see you but his vision may be obstructed as the drivers can only use their mirrors to see others on the road.  Failing to do so can be a source of serious aggravation to other drivers. Signal before you turn, change lanes, merge, or exit the freeway...every time, even when you don't think it's necessary.   If you're on a fast moving road with a fair amount of traffic, turn on your signal much sooner, to let other drivers know you are turning, and to give them ample time to pass. If you're making a left turn at an intersection, the drivers behind you will appreciate advance warning. If you need to slow down to make a turn or pull over, use your turn signal before pressing the brake pedal. This will give other drivers advance notice that you'll be slowing down soon. When you're finished making your turn or lane change, make sure your turn signal is off. If someone is performing a reasonable merge or lane change in front of you (timely and using a turn signal), let them in.  Frequent tapping of the brake pedal will make drivers around you unsure of whether you're actually stopping. On the other hand, don't brake at the absolute last possible second. Give drivers behind you plenty of time to notice that you're braking and to do likewise. A good time to start braking is when you notice the car in front of the one you're following braking.  This is not to say you should floor the gas and take off like mad. Just don't dawdle, especially when the light turns green, or when it's your turn at the stop sign. When you are changing lanes, do not slow down unless traffic demands it. In fact, speed up a little bit.  Be patient and wait for a big opening, then hit it! If the traffic is moving at 60 mph (97 km/h) and it takes you a leisurely 30 seconds to get up to speed, you'll need almost half a mile of empty highway to avoid endangering or irritating other drivers.  Stopping well short of the line can be confusing to other drivers - is that vehicle stopped for the light or has it broken down? - and you may fail to trigger the sensors that change the traffic lights. Stopping beyond the line won't get you to your destination much faster but it will interfere with other vehicles, especially those trying to turn left onto your street.  If there are multiple turn lanes, pick one and stay in it all the way throughout the turn. Drifting into an adjacent lane is likely to force another driver to take evasive action.  that all drivers slow down due to heavy traffic, inclement weather, etc. or speed up due to traffic flow, improved weather conditions, etc). Even if there are passing lanes, stay close to the speed of other vehicles unless there is a real need to go slower. When you must drive more slowly than others (looking for an address or when your vehicle is having mechanical difficulty), use your hazard flashers. If passing is difficult and you're holding up traffic, pull over from time to time to let others get by. They'll thank you for it.  The speed limit is technically an upper limit, and people are not required to drive any faster. If you need to go as fast or faster than the limit, pass when it is safe to do so.  Not only does this prevent faster traffic from flowing past, the driver next to you will be continuously distracted by your vehicle in the corner of their eye. This problem is happening more and more because some drivers don't understand how to pass properly while driving on cruise control. If you are about to pass another vehicle while on cruise, and your speed is just barely faster, gently depress the accelerator to slightly increase your speed temporarily so the pass is completed in a reasonable amount of time. The shorter the time you are alongside a vehicle you are passing, the safer the pass.  It is the passing lane and is not intended for general traffic flow, except in some urban settings. Some states, such as Ohio and Kansas, also have laws which require traffic to "keep right except for passing". If you're in the left lane and driving faster than the vehicles on your right, watch for vehicles driving faster than you coming from behind. Pull over so they too can pass, even if they are speeding (so you are not tailgated); or at least match their speed (within reason) until you can pull over. , Accept your short-lived punishment, indicate to the other driver that you are sorry for your infraction, and move on.  Over the course of many miles, all lanes will go approximately the same speed. Excessive lane changing will not get you to your destination any faster, and ultimately only makes traffic run more slowly overall. It also increases your chances of a collision.  Speeding up so they can't get into your lane is just childish, and it may mean you have made them miss their exit. Unless in fact they are switching toward the middle of the freeway. Then it may mean they intend to pass a vehicle in front of them, and may not have seen you. Use caution and allow them to merge if they continue to come into your lane.  A signal to change lanes is not an invitation to pass. Some drivers are very particular about this "rule" and will get over anyway, regardless of whether or not they have room, and it is a good way to rear-end a driver, which would be your fault even if they slam on the brakes as soon as they are in front of you.  Therefore you do not have to slow down on the freeway to get off - that's what the off-ramp is for. Conversely, the on-ramp gives you enough space to hopefully reach the typical speed limit (usually 55 to 70 miles (89 to 113 km) per hour) so that other drivers on the freeway do not need to slam on their brakes. (Notice that some on- and off-ramps may be poorly designed and thus slowing down or slamming the throttle might be necessary in these cases).  Pay attention to signs indicating interchanges and on-ramps. If you have the opportunity, safely shift lanes to allow incoming traffic to merge in a clear lane. This will help prevent bottlenecks and backups caused by merging traffic being unable to enter the flow.  If you have to pass a vehicle driving below the speed limit in the left (or passing) lane, you have two choices: pass them on the right (which is dangerous and sometimes illegal) or pull back and just drive at the slower speed. Do not tailgate them (see "Don't tailgate" step). Absolutely never pass on the shoulder of the road or blindly when there is the potential for oncoming traffic (i.e. on a state highway with 2-way traffic). This is not only illegal, but could result in you being personally responsible for the death of a pedestrian walking on the side of the road because their vehicle broke down.  Ever. Even if you think you're not putting any pressure on the pedal, you may be depressing it enough to trigger the brake lights. In this case, other drivers won't know when you're truly braking. Other possible effects are brake drag, which results in premature brake wear and decreased fuel economy; or you could inadvertently push both brake and throttle in a panic stop, potentially increasing overall stopping distance significantly.	Drive consistently. Don't impede other traffic. When you must drive more slowly than others (looking for an address or when your vehicle is having mechanical difficulty), consider turning on the indicator which is on the side of oncoming traffic. Don't tailgate. Always check your mirrors and your blind spot before passing as there may be someone else behind you driving at a much higher speed. Use your turn signal lights to signal your intentions to other drivers so your actions don't come as a surprise. When you need to use the brake to slow down, put your foot on it and decelerate smoothly. Accelerate with purpose. When pulling into moving traffic, time your move carefully and accelerate quickly so you don't force oncoming drivers to hit their brakes. Stop at the stop line, especially at intersections with traffic lights. When you are moving into a turn lane in preparation for making a turn, signal your intention, change into the turn lane, then slow down - in that order. When driving at speeds under the limit, try to drive as close to the limit as possible. unless conditions demand otherwise (i.e. If there is more than one clear lane and you are in the right lane behind someone going a few miles under the limit, do not honk or speed by and cut them off to make a point that they are going too slow. When driving on a multi-lane road, do not block other traffic by driving right next to another vehicle at the same speed. On freeways and Interstates, Do not drive in the left lane continually unless heavy traffic or upcoming turns/exits demand it. Stay out of the blind spots of other vehicles as much as possible, which are generally the right and left rear corners depending on the vehicle.  , If you inadvertently cause a situation that annoys other drivers, and they honk the horn or indicate their displeasure in some other way, do not gesture wildly, honk your own horn or jam the brakes. In heavy highway traffic, pick a lane and stay in it, but not the fast lane. If you are on the freeway and it looks like the vehicle next to you is trying to get over, it probably is because they are trying to get over. If you are behind someone who is trying to switch lanes, don't try to pass them on that side to crowd them out. Recognize that highway on-ramps and off-ramps are there so the flow of traffic will not be interrupted. Anticipate highway on-ramp incoming traffic. Passing on the right of traffic is very dangerous and also illegal in some places. Don't drive with your foot on the brake.
Stripes are a simple, baby-friendly design that are easy to create yourself with some paint and paint strips. Lay the paint strips over the wall to paint on your first shade. Let this shade dry completely and then fill in the bare spots with your second color. This is a quick, easy, low-cost design that works great for a nursery., The busier you make your decorations, the more expensive they'll be. Focusing in on a single focal point can save you money. Instead of having many decorations spread across the room, pick something like a large area rug for the center of the room. This will draw attention to a single spot in the room, making it look decorative while saving you money on excess decorations.Look for cheaper items for your focal point as well to save even more money. Check secondhand stores and discount websites to find the centerpiece you want.  If you don't have a lot of money to spend on professional supplies, decorate on your own. Even if you're not artistically inclined, things like stencils are easy enough to use.If you want a decorative dresser, for example, buy one secondhand. Paint it yourself and then stencil on the designs you want. Use chalkboard paint. You can use colorful chalk to draw any designs you want. As your baby gets older, they'll be able to experiment with painting and drawing on the wall.  When you're having a baby, you may receive a lot of toys your baby is not old enough to use. While you're waiting for the toys to be safe for your baby, use them as decorations. This will save you money buying knick-knacks for shelves and drawers.Fill in bare spots in your bookshelf with stuffed animals. For example, a stuffed owl could be placed on the bookshelf. Place things like figurines, plastic dolls, and action figures on mantels and dressers.  You can save on buying decorative items by doubling up and making your storage devices decorations. Go for things like decorative baskets, shelves, and floor storage. This can spruce up the room and add a splash of color without making you go over-budget on expensive decorations.You can also paint duller items in your nursery. For example, a yellow dresser can brighten up a room. Try painting a neutral-color piece of furniture in a bright, kid-friendly shade.  Your decorations do not have to come from a store. You can fill the nursery with personal decorations. Hang up family photographs. If you have other children, have them make artwork for the new baby.Feel free to get creative. Make a collage, for example, of family photos. Arrange family photos and mementos in a frame, using decorative paper for the background.	Choose stripes for the wall. Create one focal point. Encourage DIY decorations. Use toys as decorations. Go for decorative storage. Use personal decorations.
If you have a diatonic harmonica with a plastic comb, simply run some lukewarm water through the harmonica. Placing the mouthpiece against your palm, tap it firmly to remove the water.Only run water through the harmonica if your comb is plastic or sealed wood. If the comb is wooden or metal, do not run water through it.; , Because a harmonica is played with the mouth, saliva and other contaminants get blown into the instrument by the mouth. After each use, tap the harmonica on your hand, leg, or a towel to knock out any loose saliva. This will help keep it clean and help reduce the amount of build up in the instrument.Try to be a dry harmonica player. This means you should try to reduce the amount of saliva that you pass into the harmonica while playing., Another way you can help keep your harmonica clean and rust free is to let it dry after playing. When you place it in the case, leave the case open. This helps any moisture in the harmonica to dry instead of sitting there damp in your harmonica., If you have eaten or drunk anything right before playing, rinse your mouth with water. Remnants of food can get blown into the harmonica, and sugar or other contaminants from non-water beverages can build up a residue in the harmonica.Refrain from playing right after brushing your teeth. Any residue left over from the toothpaste or mouthwash can build up. Don't smoke while playing the harmonica. This can damage the harmonica.	Rinse with lukewarm water. Tap the harmonica after each use. Let your harmonica dry after playing. Clean your mouth before playing.
, Use a dirt tamper. Make sure the area has no puddles before you pour the concrete., If there is a natural border i.e. concrete around, or other type of framing, you will not need to build the form. Use wooden stakes to secure the forms. Use duplex nails to nail the stakes to the outside of the forms. Duplex nails are made in such a way that they can easily be pulled out once your concrete cures., Slowly add water to the mix and stir frequently. Make sure you leave some concrete available in case you make the mix too wet. If you do, just add some more concrete. The consistency of the mix should feel like clay that you can mould., Place the 2 x 4 on it's side and with the 2 x 4 resting on the edges of your forms slowly pull the screed board toward you filling in the area, and leaving it nice a level to the forms., Use this to slowly float the cement causing the pores to close., Now take a steel float and smooth out the surface.	You will need to dig the area out to a depth of about 3–4 inches (7.6–10.2 cm). , Compact the soil below. Form the area by using 2 x 4's on their side, thus creating a box or shape that the concrete will be placed. Mix the pre-mixed concrete (the bags that say "Just add Water") in a wheelbarrow. Pour the concrete into the area, and use another 2 x 4 to screed or rod the cement. Take a MAG-float, this looks like a regular concrete float, but it is thicker and made of wood, or magnesium. Wait until the surface is free of stagnant water and it looks somewhat dry.
This can be done with newspaper or an old shower curtain.   Lay the paper or curtain down on the grown and cover it with mulch, pebbles or dirt and plant your flowers. Weeds will be unable to take root or move past the buffer.  Corn gluten meal prevents germination of weed seeds but it will not bother your established plants. Best used in early spring.  This is especially useful on weeds you notice in your driveway or walkway, because the water will have an easy time running off without bothering your plants or grass.  Do not do this too close to plants or flowers, or cover them up before you spray. Vinegar will kill good growth as well as weeds.  (28.34 g) of vodka with 2 cups (473 ml) of water and add a drop of dish soap. Spray this mixture on the weeds and watch them dry up.	Create a buffer between soil and your garden. Spread corn gluten meal in your plants or on your lawn. Pour boiling water on any weeds or patches of weeds you see in your grass. Spray a combination of vinegar and water on patches of leaves. Mix 1 oz.
; ,   Slide a crimp bead and the clasp onto the string. Push the short end of the string through the crimp bead to form a loop. Pull it tight. Using flathead or crimping pliers, crimp the bead so the clasp is secure. Cut the excess string using wire cutters.  To mark the location of the beads, use White-Out or a similar correction fluid to make small marks on the string.  Flatten the crimp bead with your pliers. , Make sure the glass bead is secure between the two crimp beads, and then flatten it with your pliers.  Leave about two inches of string at the end to attach the other part of the clasp.  This is what you will attach the clasp to in order to close the necklace. ,	Gather the materials listed in the "Things You'll Need" section. Attach the clasp to one end of the string. Decide how much space you want between your beads. Put one crimp bead on the string where you want a glass bead. Slide on the glass bead.  , Put on another crimp bead. Continue to attach beads until you have finished the necklace. Repeat step two with the jump ring. If you used White-Out to mark the beads' location, scratch it off with your nail once it dries.  , Finished.

The coup will either be successful and a new government rule will be instituted, or the coup will fail and the government will remain the same.   It might be frightening to know that violence is taking place in your country, but your best option may be to wait it out.  If the conflict is ongoing and you can safely leave the country or travel to a safer region, then this may be a good option. Make sure that it is safe to travel before you decide to leave.   Try asking your local authorities about the safest route to take, or ask your friends on social media about the safest route to take if the local authorities have been overthrown. There may be roads that are blocked off or that are unsafe, so make sure that you know what roads to avoid as well. It may be safer to travel at a certain time of day, such as early in the morning or late at night. Ask the local authorities or ask your friends on social media for recommendations about when it is safest to travel.  If you are a tourist visiting a country where a coup is taking place, then you may need help getting out of the country. Contact your home country’s embassy or consulate for advice and assistance.Check your home country’s website for information on how to contact your country’s embassy or consulate.	Keep in mind that coups are often short-lived.While coups are unpredictable, they are often short lived. Leave the country or go to a safer region if the conflict continues.

Before you decide on a vehicle to purchase, you should know its cost and the prices available at multiple dealerships. This can help you decide if the vehicle you're considering is within your price range, and you can then find the best offer in your region.It's worth comparing multiple manufacturers, models, and dealers to get the best price for the car you want. Check the Kelley Blue Book to get an estimate of the going price for that vehicle or vehicles. Then compare the prices at a number of dealerships to find the best selling price in your area. Use an online auto loan calculator to figure out how much you'll need to finance the vehicle you want. You can find one by searching online, or try using the United States Automobile Association's auto loan calculator at: https://www.usaa.com/inet/pages/bank_loan_advanced_calculator_auto_page?akredirect=true ; , Your credit score is comprised of your payment history (35%), amounts you've owed (30%), the length of your credit history (15%), how many different types of credit you have in use (10%), and how many account inquiries you've made (10%).It will also include a credit diagnosis and a summary of each line of credit you have open.Knowing your credit score can help you negotiate better loan terms, instead of having to accept whatever loan offer you're given.Your credit score can affect the amount of interest that you will have to pay on an auto loan. A poor credit score may result in a high interest rate, while a good credit score may result in a lower interest rate. Make sure you know your credit score before you ever walk into a dealership. You can learn your credit score for free by using online sources like Credit Karma, or get your free annual credit score through a major reporting agency like Equifax or Experian. Visit AnnualCreditReport.com or call 1-877-322-8228 to find out more information.  Once you know your credit score, you can shop around for a better loan. It's best to do this before going to a dealership, as this gives you a better idea of what your options are.You're not under any obligation to take the loan offer that the auto dealership gives you. If you go to the dealership with other loan quotes, you may be able to negotiate for a better loan from the dealer. If not, you can simply turn down the dealer's loan and go with the better loan. You can find loan offers through banks, local credit unions, or even an online lender. Just make sure you research the lender to ensure that they are a legitimate business with good terms and interest rates.  If you have bad credit, you may be worried about what your options are. Just because you have bad credit, it doesn't mean you have to take the first loan that you're offered. There are plenty of options available for you, if you're willing to shop around.Most credit unions are local institutions that work within your community. Credit unions tend to offer more flexible payment plans and lower interest rates, even if you have bad credit. You may also want to consider a peer-to-peer lending service like Lending Club. You can get a better interest rate, but the evaluation process is thorough, with only about 10% of applicants getting approved.  Once you receive a loan offer, you'll want to look into the conditions of that loan and decide if it's right for you. There are plenty of aspects to consider, but the most important are the interest rate, the down payment requirement, and the term of the loan.The interest rate is how much extra you'll be paying for taking out the loan, applied as an annual percentage rate (APR). The term of the loan is how long you have to repay the loan, usually calculated in months. Some lenders charge a prepayment penalty if you pay off your loan before the end of the loan term, as this loses the lender money in interest. For example, if you took out a 60-month loan but paid it off in 50 months, the lender loses the interest that would have accrued over the remaining 10 months, and may charge you a penalty.It's worth comparing all aspects of the loan. A lower interest rate is good and may tempt you, but if it requires a higher downpayment and several extra months on the loan term, you may end up paying more.  If you're in a pinch, you can always ask a friend or family member for a loan. Financial issues can create a lot of tension between friends/relatives, so it's important to proceed with caution.Ask politely and respectfully. Say something like, "Could we work out an arrangement where I borrow $_____ from you? That way I could pay a lower interest rate than a bank would charge, and I can pay you back a higher interest rate than your money would have accrued in a savings account." If your friend/relative is reluctant, you can always offer to put your vehicle up as collateral. But if you do so, be aware that you'll need to pay back the loan or your friend may actually take your vehicle. Savings accounts usually offer interest rates below 5%. Offering your friend/relative an interest rate on the loan around 5% to 6% would be fair and beneficial to everyone.Determine how long it will take you to repay the loan, and work out a reasonable repayment schedule with your friend/relative. Put the agreement in writing, including the repayment schedule, and sign it to make it a binding promissory note.  Depending on your situation, refinancing may be a wonderful option. It can help you get a better loan, but it may only be worth it if certain circumstances have changed since you took out your existing loan.If interest rates have dropped by more than a few points, it may be worth refinancing your loan. If you've improved your credit score since you took out your loan, refinancing will most likely help you get a better loan. If your personal financial situation has gone downhill and you need to lower your payments, refinancing can help you get a better monthly rate.  There are certain restrictions and limitations to refinancing. Not everyone qualifies for a refinanced loan. In order to decide if you're eligible, a financial institution will evaluate your financial situation, the terms of your existing loan, and/or your vehicle.You will typically need a 6 to 12 month history of on-time loan payments to qualify. Check to see if there are any prepayment penalties on your existing loan. If there are, you'll have to pay that penalty should you choose to refinance. If your vehicle is past a certain age or if your existing loan is outside a predetermined range (set by the financial institution), you may not be eligible to refinance your loan., Once you've made the decision to refinance and you know that you're eligible, you'll want to shop around to find the best offer. This should require just as much investigative work on your end as you would put into getting a new loan, so be sure you assess all of your available options.Check with numerous lenders to find the best interest rate that you qualify for. During the application process, if you choose "auto pay" for your repayment options, you may get the lowest possible interest rate. If you're able to pay the new loan off sooner, it may be worth shortening the term of the new loan you receive. This will help you save money on interest rates.	Research the vehicle's cost. Check your credit score. Shop around for other quotes. Know your options with bad credit. Evaluate a loan. Ask a friend/relative for a loan. Assess whether refinancing would help.

You need one pot for every two seeds. Seedling trays and other containers made of cheap plastic may make it easier to transfer your seedlings into larger pots later on.; , The pot must have a 5-gallon (20-liter) capacity, at minimum, and each eggplant should have approximately 1 foot (30.5 centimeters) of space to grow. As a result, you may wish to plant only one eggplant per pot.  Eggplants love heat, and clay pots retain heat better than plastic. Select an unglazed pot if you can remember to water your plants frequently, but go with a glazed pot if you have a history of forgetting to water your plants. Unglazed pots dry the soil out more quickly than glazed pots, so eggplants living in unglazed pots will need more frequent watering.   Clay pots are also heavier than plastic pots, making it easier for them to support the weight of a mature eggplant. The pot should also have large drainage holes to help balance out the moisture level of the soil. Drainage holes will allow excess water to leave the pot, minimizing the risk of root rot.  Gently scrub the inside and outside of each pot with soap and warm water. If you do not clean your containers, microscopic insect eggs and harmful bacteria inside the pots could damage your eggplants.  A good, simple option is a mix of two parts potting soil and one part sand. The soil provides your plant with the nutrients it needs, while the sand controls moisture. Mix a little compost and 5-10-5 fertilizer into the soil to provide additional nutrition. A 5-10-5 fertilizer contains fairly mild concentrations of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, with a little extra phosphorus to promote stronger roots and increase the yield of eggplants.  Without any support, your eggplants will have very little upward growth and, as a result, they will yield very little fruit. A tomato cage or teepee stake should be enough to provide your plant with adequate support.  Eggplants require temperatures of 55 degrees Fahrenheit (12.8 degrees Celsius) or higher, which may be difficult to provide in the outdoors during spring. By starting your eggplants indoors, you can begin as early as April.  The soil should be loosely placed into the containers, but it should not be compressed.  Use your pinky finger or the rounded end of a pen or pencil to create holes with a good diameter.  Planting two seeds improves the odds of at least one seed sprouting. Planting more than two seeds may deprive the seeds of the nutrition the need to take root, however.  Lightly drop the soil over the seeds instead of packing it in.  Choose a window in full sun, meaning one that receives direct sunlight for at least 8 hours a day. Full sun provides enough light and warmth to spur growth.  Keep the soil moist to the touch at all times, but do not supersaturate, especially if using trays without drainage holes. You do not want to create puddles on the top of your soil, but you should also seek to prevent the soil from ever drying out.  In each pot or tray compartment, keep the stronger of the two seedlings and snip the other one down to soil level. Do not yank the weaker seedling out, since doing so may disrupt the roots of the seedling you wish to keep.  Only do this if the weather outdoors has warmed up sufficiently, however. Eggplants do best when kept outdoors, even in pots, since they have more access to sunlight and can be pollinated.  Keep the feet of the stake or tomato cage flat on the bottom of the pot, positioning the stake in a straight, upright position.  Pack the soil around the stake and make sure that the stake is held firmly in place. Leave 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) of empty space in between the top of the soil and the rim of the pot.  The hole should be in the center of the pot.  The weaker seedling should have already been thinned out.   Wet the soil to make it as compact as possible. Moist, compact soil will be easier to transplant than dry, crumbly soil. If the seedling is in a cheap plastic container, you can “wiggle” it out of the container by bending the plastic. If the seedling is in a stiffer container, you may need to carefully slide a gardening trowel into the side of the pot and beneath the entirety of the pot’s contents. Tip the container on its side and slowly guide the seedling, soil and all, out of the pot.  Keep the seedling as upright as possible.  Do not press down with too much force, since doing so may damage the root system. You should, however, fill in any empty space in order to make sure that the seedling is firmly in place.  Give your plant a thorough watering, but do not allow puddles to develop on the top of the soil.  An outdoor spot that receives full sun is ideal, as both the light and sun are essential in promoting a good harvest. Eggplants thrive in warm soil.  In hot, dry weather, your plant may even need multiple waterings a day. Feel the surface of the soil with your finger tips and saturate the soil if it appears dry. Allowing the soil to dry out will reduce the number of eggplants you can grow.  Use a water soluble fertilizer and water your eggplant before adding it to the soil, rather than adding it to dry soil. Follow the directions on the back of the label to determine an appropriate amount.   If the leaves of your eggplant begin to pale, you may need to add more fertilizer. A boost of 5-10-5 fertilizer should help significantly if a lack of nutrition is your plant's only problem. A fertilizer with a higher number, meaning a higher percentage of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, may prove too strong. Do not dig any deeper than 1/2-inch (1 1/4 centimeters) beneath the surface of the soil when scratching in fertilizer. Digging any deeper than that could disturb the eggplant's roots, which are rather shallow.  Soil with a pH between 6.3 and 6.8 should fulfill your eggplant's needs. Litmus paper or a pH meter should be able to give you an accurate reading.   If you need to increase the pH, try using agricultural lime. If you need to decrease the pH, add additional organic matter such as compost or plant litter, or switch to a fertilizer with urea in it.  As your plant begins to climb, loosely tie the stem of the plant to the stake using twine or thin fabric thread. Tying the thread too tightly may cut into the stem or choke it.  Cutworms are one of the most common pests that attack eggplants, but they can usually be driven away by placing a cutworm collar over the plant. You may also consider an organic pesticide to drive away cutworms and many other pests.  The fruit should stop growing larger and, in many cases, it will be around the size of a large orange. The length of time this takes varies depending on the variety you chose, but your eggplant will usually be ready for harvest within two or three months after you initially planted your seeds.   Snip the eggplant off its vine using pruning shears. The vegetable should only have a short stem upon removal.	Purchase small pots or plastic gardening trays if starting your eggplants from seed. Choose a large pot to house your mature eggplant. Opt for a clay pot. Clean your containers, especially if the containers once held other plants. Prepare a growing medium. Invest in a small support system. Start your seeds indoors to get a jump on the growing season. Fill your small pots or trays with potting mix. Poke a 1/2-inch (1 1/4-centimeter) hole in the center of each pot or tray compartment. Place two seeds in each hole. Cover the seeds with additional potting mix. Set the pots or trays out on a warm, sunny windowsill. Water your seeds. Thin your seedlings once they sprout two sets of leaves. Prepare your eggplants for transplanting once the plants have reached at least 1/2-foot (15 1/4 centimeters) in height. Set up your staking system in your permanent pot. Fill your eggplant’s permanent home with your potting medium. Dig a hole in the soil that is as deep and wide as the container your seedlings are currently in. Remove the stronger seedling from its previous container. Place the seedling into the hole in its new pot. Pack additional potting medium around the seedling to fix it in place. Water the soil. Place your pot in a sunny location. Water your eggplant daily. Add a liquid fertilizer once every one or two weeks. Monitor the soil's pH. Tie your eggplant to the stake to promote upward growth. Keep an eye out for pests. Harvest your eggplants once the skin looks glossy.
Before you start making your mask, first decide on a design. Use the Internet or books on Greek theater inspire ideas of what your mask could look like. You don’t have to base your own design on these examples, but they can guide you in the right direction if you don’t know where to start., You should choose a simple but clear expression to represent. You may decide to make a mask that is happy, sad, angry, excited, etc.If you are making the mask for a particular play, think about your character and the primary emotions they feel during the play. Remember that you will be poking out eye holes, so make sure your design has large, open eyes.  Once you have settled on a design, draw it on a piece of paper. Even though you won’t actually use this paper to make you mask, recording your design will help you to remember it exactly as you wanted it.	Research for inspiration. Decide what emotion you want to convey. Draw your design.
Get an electronic tuner to make sure that your guitar is tuned. Trying to learn how to play different songs with an untuned guitar can confuse you. Also, many guides that you find online will be using standard tuning.   Standard tuning starting from the top string to the bottom is E, A, D, g, b, e.Play open notes on your guitar and make sure that they correspond with the digital output on the tuner.; , When you are sitting down, there are two main ways to hold your guitar. For a casual playing style, lay the guitar over your dominant leg. On the other hand, the classical method has you set your guitar on your non-dominant leg. In both instances, make sure that the guitar is held close against your body. Holding your guitar properly makes it easier to play and prevents you from becoming fatigued. Play around with both styles and figure out which one is most comfortable for you.The classical style gives you more control over the neck of your guitar. The casual style reduces fatigue as you play. Make sure that the guitar is upright while you play because tilting the guitar can hurt your wrists. When standing, make sure that you have a strap on your guitar and that the guitar is tight against your torso, with the top of the guitar over your chest.Maintain a relaxed posture as you play your guitar.  Chords occur when you play two or more notes on different strings simultaneously to create one unified sound. These are what make up the "rhythm" portion of acoustic music. Single notes are used more for solos and occur when you play a single note at a time. Both are skills that you must become proficient in when learning to play the acoustic guitar., Open chords are chords that are played towards the top of your guitar's neck, near the tuning knobs. When playing the acoustic guitar, knowing the open chord shapes is critical to play popular rhythms. Figure out two easy chords, like E minor and A major, for example, to get an understanding of their shape.The 8 most common beginner open chords include C, A, G, E, D, Am, Em, and Dm. Don't get overwhelmed by the number of different open chords, start off by learning one or two, then move onto more complex open chords. The left string on the chord chart refers to the top string on your guitar. Your strings are numbered from 1-6 starting from the bottom string, or the 1st string.  The dots on the chords represent where you should hold down your fingers on the neck. For instance, an A major is played by holding down the string on the second fret on the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th string. An E minor is played by holding down the second fret on the 5th and 4th string. Hold the strings down until they are pressed against the neck of your guitar., Hold down the strings with your fingers in the appropriate shape and try to strum with your other hand. Acoustic guitar strings often have higher actions than electric guitars, so you may have to press down very hard to get a good sound. If the chord comes out muted, try holding down the strings with more force. If your string is buzzing, move your finger further away from the metal fret on your neck.On your chord chart, you'll either have an o or an x over each of your six strings. This designates which strings you should strum and which strings you should not. For an A major, you strum all of the strings but the top string. For an E minor, you strum all of the strings.  Now instead of strumming on one chord, practice going back and forth between your E minor and A major. Strum four times up and down on your E minor chord before re-positioning your hand and strumming the A major chord four times, up and down.  Once you're able to produce a good sounding chord, try strumming it at different tempos and rhythms. Rhythm is based on your strumming pattern, and how long you're holding your notes. Try a basic 1-2-3-4 beat, otherwise known as a 4/4. The number on the top represents how many beats there are in the measure. Try strumming up and down in different progressions to create a different sound for your rhythm. Once you get a basic rhythm down, you can start to incorporate quicker or slower strumming.As you play your fingers might get sore. If this is the case, take a break and come back to practicing later.  If you don't already know how to read music, it can take a lot of time to memorize and proficiently read sheet music. Tabs are an easier and more intuitive way to write music for beginners that doesn't require any formal education. Tabs will simply tell you where to put your fingers on a fret board and how to generally play a song.While traditional sheet music can tell you the duration of the notes in a song, tabs require you to listen to the music itself. If you're interested in playing other instruments, you should learn how to read music.  Tabs will have six lines that represent your strings, along with numbers that designate where you should be placing your fingers. The numbers represent the fret in which you need to hold the string down. A 1 means the first fret, a 2 means the second fret, and so on. Numbers in a progression mean that you hold down the first individual fret and pick the note, then move to the next one, and so on in succession. Numbers on the same vertical line are meant to be played together simultaneously as a chord.Tabs are read from left to right.  Listen to acoustic guitar songs that you enjoy and choose one that you'd like to learn. When finding your first song, try to find a song that has an easy chord progression. Listen to the song and determine how many chord changes it has and the speed in which the song is played. If there aren't that many chords or the song seems simple to play, you should choose that song as your first song to learn.   Easy songs to learn include “Three Little Birds” by Bob Marley, “Hey There Delilah” by the Plain White T’s, and “Upside Down” by Jack Johnson., Type in the name and artist of the song and look up the tabs in a search engine. Once you find the tabs, you'll be able to see which chords and notes that the artist is using to play the song.  Open the song that you're covering in another window on your internet browser. Play through the song and trace the chords and notes with the tab that you looked up. Try to follow the numbers on the tab with the notes that are being played in the song. Try to get an understanding for which chords the artist is playing before trying to duplicating it.   Listen to the song 3 or 4 times.  Once you have a basic understanding of how the notes are played throughout the song, you can start to hold each of the chords. If the song consists of chords that you're used to playing, it will make the process easier. If the song uses different chords, it may take some time and adjustment to get used to them. Practice the chords separately if they are unfamiliar to you., If the song's chords and progressions are new to you, it's easier to break the song down into separate parts. Examine the tabs and figure out parts where the chords or rhythm is repetitive. Master each of these individual parts before trying to play the entire song.If you are really familiar with the chords that the song is using, you can try playing the song all the way through over the recording of the riff.  Once you've mastered the individual portions of the song, you're ready to play the song in its entirety. Play the song and strum your guitar along with the song. Try to keep up with the tempo of the song you're covering. Follow the tabs as you play. If you mess up, follow the music on the tabs and come back into the song when you're ready. Once you've become proficient at playing the riff, continue practicing until you don't need the tabs anymore.   If your guitar is sounding different than the track, your guitar may be out of tune, or you may be playing the wrong notes or chords. Since tabs are sometimes user-submitted, they aren't always exact.  Holding down a string and producing a decent sound can sometimes be more challenging than it looks. If you don't hold down a string hard enough, you'll get a muted note and if you hold down the string too close to the fret your guitar will buzz. Practice picking in an up and down motion on your string with the other hand. Continue doing this until you feel comfortable moving up or down the neck to a different note. Practice playing the notes back and forth until you become comfortable strumming.   Practice picking individual notes until you can go all the way up and down the neck of the guitar with ease. At first, you're likely to pick the wrong string. Continue to practice until you know where the string is via muscle memory.  One way to become proficient quickly is to learn how to transition between the various chords quickly. These transition periods are often the hardest for beginners to play when they are starting off. The more you practice between switching to different chords, however, the better you'll get at doing it in songs. Practice switching between open chords like G, A, E, and C. Take your time and be deliberate when switching from chord to chord.  Consistent practice will allow you to improve your guitar playing skills over a short period. Taking long breaks and not staying dedicated will wear away your muscle memory and delay the development of your skills. Instead, dedicate 20 minutes to an hour of practice throughout most of the week. During practice, you can either run different drills or you can try covering a song.Once you get more comfortable with the guitar and your fingers don't hurt as much, you can make your practice sessions longer. You will start to build callouses over your fingertips over time and will be able to play without the pain. If you notice pain in your wrist, take a break. Try to re-position it so it doesn't hurt while you play.  There are a variety of different tutorials online that can teach you basic or advanced techniques for the acoustic guitar. Search for lessons on popular websites like YouTube or visit websites that have guitar tutorials for free. The more informal instruction you're able to absorb, the better you'll become.   Top guitar tutorial sites include Guitar Tricks, Justin Guitar, JamPlay, and ArtistWorks., There are apps that you can download to your mobile device that will help you learn how to play the acoustic guitar. These apps range from step-to-step guides on how to play, to apps that can act as mixers and recorders. Go to the app store for your device and try to find some apps that can help you.

Tie string between the stakes to serve as guides for digging.; , You should dig down below the frost line, which is usually about 1 foot (or 30 cm) down. If building a retaining wall on a slope, make sure the bottom of your hole is flat.  These pieces will make a form to stretch around the whole area of your wall.  These will serve to spread out the concrete to prevent cracking.  Make sure it lies level. Secure it the ground with stakes or other weights. It should be secure enough to remain solid when stood upon. Concrete is brittle, like toast. ideally wire a mesh to give flexible strength.  The type and quantity of concrete mix will depend on the size and nature of your wall.    Keep a fresh batch of concrete mix ready as you go along. Pour concrete as quickly and evenly as you can so that no part of the wall dries much before any other. If you will be topping your wall with concrete, brush the top surface to create a nice texture. If you will be adding stone or another surface to the top, do so while the concrete mix is still wet. ,,	Measure out the area of your wall and drive stakes into the corners. Dig out the area of the wall. Measure and cut pieces of plywood to stand a few inches (or about 10 cm) above the eventual height of your wall. Attach small blocks of wood to the inside of the plywood at intervals of about 2 feet (0.6 m) (or 60 cm). Place the form into the hole. Mix concrete. Pour concrete from the wheelbarrow into the form. Even off the concrete with a trowel when you reach the top of the wall.  , Wait at least half a day for the concrete to dry.  , Remove the form.
Help out, if you have the chance. Notice if any tools or utensils seem flimsy, worn, or if any task seems to require undue time or effort.   Find out if the recipient is trying anything new. Is he learning how to bake bread? This might be the right time for a dough scraper. There is a gadget for almost everything. The right tool will be a great help in their cooking. The wrong tool will be just so much unused clutter. Remember that a worn tool may be worn because it's well used and the right tool for the job. If it's on its last legs, a replacement may be just the thing. If it's an old standby and still going strong, don't replace it. Keep your ears open for any opinions (good or bad) about the tools they have or don't have. These are often good clues as to what gifts would be well received.; , If you also cook, there's a good chance you know a dish or two that would be new to your recipient.   Offer to cook it with the person, if you have time. This is especially valuable if the recipe involves any special techniques. Create a small gift voucher or promise note setting out the offer.  Write out the recipe and put at least the non-perishable ingredients together as a mix or kit. One possibility is to put them in a jar.  The best ingredients may not be something entirely new, but something a little fancier or more expensive than the ones they currently use. Here are some possibilities to get you started:   Salt and pepper. For a gift, look for the fancy, gourmet versions, such as pink Himalayan salt, that your aspiring chef may not have tried yet. Many come in grinders.       Real maple syrup. You could pair it with a pancake or waffle mix, or with a griddle or waffle iron if they don't yet have one.  Honey. Honeys can be as diverse and complex in flavor as wine, depending on what kinds of plants the bees visited. See what your local natural foods or specialty store offers, and get a special kind, or a selection.       Handmade pasta. Include some quality olive oil to round out the gift. Balsamic vinegar. If you live near a wine region, your local winery should have some excellent choices.  Homemade bread, jam or preserves, or fresh, homegrown produce all make excellent gifts.   Include a label with relevant dates and ingredients. You might also like to share the recipe, unless it's a family secret!  , A foodie outing can be a wonderful experience as a gift and you get to enjoy the experience too.   Go wine tasting.       Give the cook a day off. Visit a good restaurant together, or cook for the person.  Visit a farmer's market or gourmet market together. Offer to purchase some items there as part of the outing. Look for local restaurant events in which you get to sample restaurant cuisine portions at great prices; this can make a fun and inspiring outing.  In many places, it's possible to subscribe to an assortment of things, either on a one-time or monthly basis.   A wine of the month. A Community Supported Agriculture program (CSA). Here, you support with a local, small farm, buying fresh, local produce (and sometimes eggs and meats). A cooking-related magazine.  Good kitchen scissors are indispensable, yet scissors get damaged and lost, and kitchen scissors are often chosen as an afterthought.   Quality knives are also desirable but not everyone is comfortable with giving knives as a present.  Natural and specialty foods are good choices, if your recipient will use them.   Another useful idea is to give a certificate to cooking classes at a local store or restaurant. Be sure to check for flexibility in the classes so that your recipient can attend at their convenience.  Even if it's just a windowsill, start an indoor herb garden or supply the seeds, pots, and soil for one.   An indoor salad-growing kit is a wonderful gift for apartment dwellers and winter gifts.  A wok, chopsticks, and sushi rollers can be a great gift as well.  Maybe they could make some exotic recipes they've never heard of using that, or even making a classic recipe that's really popular among a lot of people.  A macro lens or camera set on close-up or food mode works great. Compile the images into a photo book and add in notes or simply blank lined pages for the recipient to write in their recipe for the dish.	Watch your recipient in the kitchen. Share a recipe. Offer ingredients. Share your personal specialty. Go on an outing together. Look around for subscription services. Consider kitchen scissors. Give a gift certificate to a local food store. Give plants. Consider giving him/her cultural cookware. Buy them a cookbook. Take close up pictures of dishes they have made.
If you live in a rented space, this might not be an option for you. However, if you’re able to, painting the walls in your house can be one of the quickest ways to freshen up the look and add a bit of interest. Choose a color that complements your personality and fits your space. If you’re bubbly and fun, consider a golden yellow or bright green. Calm and collected? A shade of gray or blue might be more your pace. Paint isn’t permanent, so feel free to experiment with colors until you find a look you love!   Don’t be afraid to try several colors spread throughout your home; although you don’t want many different bright colors, painting each room a different color is totally appropriate.       Although it’s not as in style as it used to be, you can apply wallpaper on an accent wall to add a bit of pattern, if you want. There are even wall decals that act like wallpaper but are removable, if you’re afraid of the permanence of it.       If you’re not ready to paint one whole room (let alone your house!), try adding an accent wall. This is when you paint just a single wall in a room, typically one that gets a lot of attention, a bright or cheery color that matches your décor.      ; , Furniture is arguably the most important aspect of decorating; if you’re short on furniture or have been using the same pieces for many years, consider bringing some new furniture into your home. Choose comfortable pieces in colors and styles that match your personality. Don’t be afraid to try something other than what the store model has set up; furniture that truly shows your personality will fit in your space better than boring floor model furniture you pick up because it is on sale.   Don’t be afraid to buy used furniture from thrift stores; it is easy to repaint and reupholster these to match your space.       Mix and match furniture rather than using only matching sets; you’ll end up with a more unique look, and probably save some money in the process.  Whether you’re incredibly organized or a bit of a hoarder, nearly everyone has stuff that needs to go into storage. Rather than shoving it under a bed or in the back of a closet, try using decorative storage instead. Look for ottomans that store things in their hollow centers, entertainment centers with doors, and large bookshelves and hutches to hold your knickknacks. By using storage that’s attractive, you kill two birds with one stone.   Cover shoeboxes in fabric or spray-paint store-bought storage crates to create sophisticated solutions to your storage problems.       Book cases can be used to store nearly anything, aside from books. Consider placing one in your kitchen to hold dishes or in your living room for assorted decorations.       When you buy new furniture, look for pieces that have hidden storage available., If you don’t have enough money to buy new furniture for your apartment, give your current furniture a makeover. In a kitchen or bathroom, try painting the cabinets a new color or staining them. Use cheap fabric to reupholster your couches or chairs, and try a stain on your floors to change the color. Wood accents (on edges of furniture, the windowsills, trim, doors, etc.) can be painted or stained a bold new color. If nothing else, try moving your furniture into new locations and see the difference it makes on their appearance.	Paint your walls. Try out new furniture. Use decorative storage. Refurbish old furniture and accents.
The length will determine the pitch of your didgeridoo. It's easier to estimate longer, you can always cut it down. A length of 51.5" (including the mouthpiece) will tune your didgeridoo to a low C.; , This will make the mouthpiece.  These tend to send off ribbons and hangnails that will only impede your airways. A wire brush is ideal for this task, but you can shave off excess PVC with a pocketknife if need be.  Place the coupling firmly onto the end of the pipe. Fit the bushing into the coupling. You now have an assembled didgeridoo!	Buy a length of 1-1/2" PVC pipe from five to six feet long. Buy a Female-Female 1-1/2" coupler piece, and a 1-1/2" to 1" bushing. Clean the cut edges of the PVC pipe. Assemble your instrument.
If you don't have a website, creating one if very easy: you can either pay a small fee to have your own domain name, or you can use one of the popular blog sites to start a free site. , Post it at your gigs and at local coffee shops, libraries, or musical venues.   Make sure the flyer outlines necessary information, including the name of your band, the style of music you play, your musical influences, and what type of musician you're looking for (drummer, guitarist, singer, etc.). Include the URL of your band's website, if applicable.  Examples include managers of concert venues, people who run open mic nights, or owners of local music stores.   Even if these people don't know anyone looking for a band, you might be able to post flyers at their locations, which are frequented by local musicians.	Post a notice on your website.

Begin to dry your damp book by standing it up vertically. As noted above, this is usually easy if your book is hardbound, but can be trickier if you have a paperback. If you need to, you can use heavy weights or bookends to keep the book upright. Open the book a moderate amount — no more than about 60o. Ensure the book is well-balanced and is unlikely to fall over before proceeding.  Without opening the book's cover to more than about 60o, gently fan the book's pages out. Try to arrange the pages so that there is a tiny gap between most (if not all) of them. The pages should be able to stand roughly upright — none should hang at a diagonal angle or flop limply against neighboring pages.  When your book's pages are evenly fanned out, allow it to begin drying in its upright position. To speed the drying process, ensure that relatively dry air is circulating freely through the room. Use a fan or create a draft by opening a few windows, or, if the ambient air is fairly humid, use a dehumidifier to make it drier.   If you use a fan or a natural breeze, look at the edges of the book's pages closely. The movement of the air shouldn't cause the pages to flutter or flap in the wind, as this can lead the pages to become ruffled and "puffed up" when they dry. Be patient here. It can take days or even a week or more for the book to dry completely. Check on your book frequently to get a sense for how quickly you're making progress.  Eventually, after you've allowed your book to dry patiently, no further moisture should remain in its pages. However, even if you've followed the instructions very carefully, it's likely that the book won't sit completely flat once it's dry. The paper used for most books' pages is somewhat fragile and can easily warp and deform as it dries, leaving the book with a "crumpled" or "ruffled" appearance when it's finally dry. Luckily, to a certain extent, this can be fixed. Lay your dry book flat and place a heavy weight on top of it (thick textbooks are great for this) and allow it to sit for several days to a week. This can substantially reduce the "crumpled" effect that drying can produce, though it may not fix it completely.   To avoid deforming your book, make sure that its edges are perfectly square as it lays under the weight. Don't let the weight sit on top of it in a way that bends the book or forces the edges of its pages to lay at a diagonal angle.  While the methods above should work well for most books, small, thin paperbacks can be dried with a shortcut that requires a little less effort than the fanned pages method above. If your paperback is very wet, dry it as you normally would according to the methods above until it reaches a point where it's just damp — paper towels inserted into its pages should no longer become saturated with moisture. At this point, string a fishing line, a thin wire, or a piece of string between two vertical surfaces and hang the book over it so that it opens downward. If you're indoors, circulate the air with a fan or use a dehumidifier. Within a few days, the book should be dry.   As noted above, if you're hanging your paperback outside (for instance, if you're using an existing clothing line), don't let it stay out overnight. Dew that forms in the morning can dampen the book. Don't hang paperbacks that are very wet. Since moisture makes paper more fragile, the fishing line or wire can tear the book under its own weight if it's too wet.	Stand the book upright and open it. Fan the pages out. Circulate dry air in the room. When dry, place under weight to flatten. Hang small paperbacks over a fishing line.
Any number of pieces of either round or flat web may be used, and the blanket made wider and longer if desired.; , Begin sewing from this, turn down to the end of the fifteen inches and again turn, bringing the web around over the end. Care must be taken while turning to keep the ends perfectly flat.  Make four or any desired number of parts, and sew them together, alternating the colors. ,	Spool knit four pieces of flat web, each piece three yards long. Measure fifteen inches of web and turn it. When the three yards are used begin the other parts in the same way. Put a tassel made of the same material on the rounded end of each part.  , Finished.
Try adding a ribbon and feathers to the top hat, or buttons, or really anything. Anything you can balance on that hat is fair game. , You can use some red lipstick in a messy way to add more zany flavor to the costume. You could also use white face make up from a costume store to make your face paler. Consider using some blue, green, or purple mascara too. , Thin riding or driving gloves are a good option, but remember the stranger the better.  An older wooden cane is another component of the Mad Hatter costume. You can order a plastic cane online or find one at a costume store, but you also might be able to find a more legitimate looking wooden cane at a thrift store.  Try to write in old antiqued font. Burning the edges is a good idea too. Glue this final accessory to your hat and you’ll be done.	Add accessories to your hat. Use makeup. Consider buying some old gloves. Get yourself a cane. Draw the numbers 10/6 on an extra piece of construction paper.
Wash the vase with warm water and soap. Pat it dry with a soft, clean towel, then wipe it down with rubbing alcohol. This will get rid of any oils that might prevent the foil from sticking.  If you want nice, crisp lines, apply some painter's tape just above where you want the gold leaf to end.If you want a jagged line instead, you can skip this step., You don't absolutely have to do this, but many people find it easier to apply the gold leaf in smaller pieces. Whole sheets are typically harder to remove., Avoid getting any onto the painter's tape. You can use the brush-on kind or the spray-on kind. The brush on kind is great if you want a jagged line. The spray-on kind is great if you need to cove a large area. For small or delicate areas, use a gold leaf adhesive pen instead.Most types of gold leaf will have a paper backing. Leave this backing on the gold leaf.  Once the glue dries, it will be tacky and ready for the gold leaf.Read the label on your gold leaf adhesive as each brand will be a little different., If your gold leaf has a paper backing, make sure that you place it gold-side-down onto the vase.If your gold leaf does not have a paper backing, it would be a good idea to handle it with tweezers so that it does not stick against your skin., If your gold leaf has a paper backing, gently rub your finger against it.If your gold leaf does not have a paper backing, gently brush the gold leaf with a soft, watercolor brush., Some of the gold leaf may be sticking up. If this happens, simply smooth it down with a soft, clean brush.If your gold leaf did not have a paper backing, you can skip this step., If the adhesive starts to lose its tack, you may have to apply more on. Keep applying the gold leaf, rubbing it, then peeling the paper backing away until your design is finished., Use a soft, clean brush, such as a watercolor brush, to gently brush away any excess gold leaf., Be very careful while doing this. If you get any chips in your work, you can try filling them in with extra gold leaf. The gold leaf will only stick to the areas that have adhesive on them., Extend the sealer just past the edges of the gold leaf onto the vase. This will help seal the gold leaf in further and prevent it from sticking. Don't worry if the sealer goes on milky; it will turn clear., As the sealer dries, it will turn clear. How long this takes depends on the type of sealer you used. Some only take 15 to 20 minutes to dry while others need a few hours.	Clean the vase. Mask off you vase with painter's tape, if desired. Cut the gold leaf down to smaller pieces, if desired. Apply gold leaf adhesive to your vase. Let the adhesive dry. Press the gold leaf onto the adhesive. Gently rub the back of the gold leaf against the vase. Peel the paper backing away. Continue applying gold leaf. Brush off the excess gold leaf with a paintbrush. Peel away any stencils and painter's tape. Use a paintbrush to apply gold leaf sealer over the gold leaf. Let the sealer dry completely.
Try a mnemonic device to help you remember the names of the strings: EADGBE. Simply make up a sentence where the first letter of each word is the name of a string.If you're having a hard time coming up with your own sentence, you might want to use "Eat All Day Get Big Easy." Hold your guitar in front of you so that it's facing you and look at the strings. The thickest string on the far left is low E. The A string is next to it. The third string from the left is D, followed by the G string and the B string. Finally you have the high E string to the far right, which will be the thinnest string on your instrument. One thing to keep in mind is that as you're looking down at a guitar from a playing position, the lowest strings will be on the top of the instrument (if you're playing right-handed). However, when you're told to play the "top" strings, you're actually playing the thinner strings that correspond to higher notes. The "bottom" strings are the thicker strings that correspond to lower notes.; , The frets are the bars that span the neck of your guitar, spaced about an inch apart. You'll be placing your fingers along the neck of the guitar at a position just above the fret indicated.         The first fret will be about an inch down from the nut or top of the guitar neck. The second fret is about an inch below that, the third fret about an inch below that, and so on. Basic open chords typically only use the first three frets, so when you're just starting out that's all you need to be worried about.  Even if you know how to read music, musical notation won't tell you where to place your fingers to play chords on a guitar. Fingerboard diagrams can help you learn where to place your fingers. Find them online, or download a free mobile app.The fingerboard diagram reads from left to right. If you hold up your guitar in front of you as you did to learn the strings, the line to the far left of the diagram is low E. The vertical lines on the diagram are the strings, while the horizontal lines are the frets. There will be circles on the diagram to show where your fingers should be placed. You'll see a number in the circle that corresponds to the finger that should be placed there. Memorize the finger numbers. Your index finger is your first finger, your middle finger is your second finger, your ring finger is your third finger, and your pinky is your fourth finger. Some more complex chords also require you to use your thumb, which is represented by a "T" on most fingerboard diagrams.  The G major chord is probably one that sounds familiar, as it is the basic chord in a lot of popular songs. To finger a G major chord, put your third finger on the third fret of the low E string, your second finger on the second fret of the A string, and your fourth finger on the third fret of the high E string.         If this finger position feels uncomfortable, you can also make a G major using your first, second, and third fingers instead of your second, third, and fourth. However, keep in mind that as you progress this finger positioning may make it more difficult for you to transition quickly from G major to other chords. When you first place your fingers, strum each string individually. For G major, you're going to strum all six strings, even the unfretted ones. This is what makes it an open chord. With an open chord, each chord you strum should sound clearly. If a string sounds flat or muted, check your finger positioning. You should put the tip of your finger on the string to press it down, but your finger shouldn't touch any other strings.  To make a C major chord, put your first finger on the first fret of the B string, your second finger on the second fret of the D string, and your third finger on the third fret of the B string.Notice that the finger numbers correspond to the fret numbers. That makes C major a pretty easy chord to remember. When you strum a C major, you want to stick to the top five strings – don't strum the low E. Since you're used to strumming all six strings with G major, this might take some practice to get right. Now that you know two chords, you might want to practice transitioning back and forth between them. This will help you memorize the chord shape and your hand positioning so that you can find the chords without needing to look at a fingerboard diagram.  To make a D major chord, you'll place your third finger on the third fret of the B string, your second finger on the second fret of the high E string, and your first finger on the second fret of the G string.         To strum D major, you only want to strum the top four strings. In addition to the low E string that you left out when you strummed C major, you're also leaving out the A string. You might want to practice transitioning back and forth between G major and D major, so you can get a better feel of which strings should be strummed.  Once you're comfortable with G major, C major, and D major, you have all you need to learn some classic songs that can be played using only these three chords.         Some examples of popular songs that you can play once you know G, C, and D include Already Gone by the Eagles, Small Town and Jack and Diane by John Mellencamp, and Thunder on the Mountain by Bob Dylan. You can find lists of songs that use those three chords online. If you can't read music, look for tablatures (or just "tabs") that simply give you the names of the chords played. You'll want to start slow. Eventually, you can pull up the audio recording of the song and play your guitar along with the recording. If you can find a live video of the musicians performing, this can help you nail the strumming pattern. It may be tough to get the hang of at first, but this will help you get your strumming and chord transitions up to speed.  If the strings are buzzing or sounding flat, it could be because your fingers are flattening out and touching the strings beside the string you're fretting. Your two finger joints should make something of a box over the neck of the guitar.The first finger joint often has the most tendency to flatten out, and can muffle or mute the string next to the one you're fretting. To help get your fingers in the right position, think of holding an apple or a tennis ball in your hand with your fingers curled around it. This is how you want your fingers to be on the neck of the guitar – not flat. C major and G major are good chords to use to check your finger positioning. Since your fingers are further extended, it can be easier for the knuckles to flatten out.  If the chord isn't sounding right when you compare it to audio files, assuming your guitar is in tune, the problem may be that your fingers aren't close enough to the right fret.Generally, you want to try to keep your fingers as close to the fret as possible – but not on the fret. In your mind, visualize the space between the frets as divided into quarters. Your finger should be in the lower quarter of this space, and no higher. For example, if you're playing a chord that requires your third finger to the on the second fret, your finger should be about three-quarters down from the first fret, just above the second fret.  You don't have to press down too hard on the string to make the note sound. Too much pressure can cause tension and pain in your hand, not to mention injuring the skin on your fingers.         When you make a chord, you should be applying even pressure on each of the strings that you're fretting. If you're applying too much (or too little) pressure to one of the strings, it can cause the chord to sound off.  Your wrist positioning is in many ways just as important as your finger positioning, especially if you eventually want to learn more advanced guitar chords and techniques such as bar chords or power chords. Make sure your wrist is in a neutral position.         If you tend to kink your wrist forward in front of the guitar neck, you'll probably experience pain after playing for awhile, and your fingers will have less mobility. You also may have the tendency to kink your wrist behind the guitar neck. This may inhibit your ability to get a clean sound from your chords, as well as causing your fingers to flatten. Keep in mind that kinking your wrist not only affects your guitar's sound and your ability to position your fingers correctly, it also can damage your wrist and lead to more serious issues such as carpal tunnel syndrome over time. If you plan to play guitar often, find some good wrist strengthening exercises and stretches to help take care of your wrists and prevent such problems.  If you aren't sitting (or standing) with good posture, you may have problems positioning your fingers or wrist correctly. Keep your thumb on the guitar to distribute the weight, and make sure your arms and shoulders are relaxed.If you're hunched over or crunching your shoulders, you probably also have the tendency to kink your wrist. Check your elbows as well. The elbow of your fretting arm should be close to your side, not jutting out away from you. If you have the tendency to jut your elbow out, this may be causing you to hunch over or to kind your wrist. At least when you're first learning to play, it's typically a good idea to practice while sitting rather than trying to stand. That way you can balance the bulk of the guitar's weight on your lap rather than hanging from a strap, which can cause you to hunch if you're unaccustomed to the weight.  To finger E major, your second finger will be on the second fret of the A string, your third finger on the second fret of the D string, and your first finger on the first fret of the G string.         From E major, if you lift your first or index finger off the string and strum, you have an E minor chord. Practice strumming these two chords together by lifting your index finger on every other strum.  With A minor, you use exactly the same finger shape that you used to make E major, but you move your fingers over to a different set of strings. This makes A minor easy to find after you've been practicing E major.When you strum A minor, leave the low E string out and only strum the top five strings. You'll strum the same strings for A major as you do for A minor.  For A major, your first, second, and third fingers will all be lined up along the second fret of the D, G, and B strings. This finger positioning can be difficult because there isn't much room for your second finger between your first and third.         You'll find that your first and second fingers can't really be as close to the fret as would be ideal. You'll get more comfortable with practice and be able to stretch your fingers closer to the fret. Practicing switching from A major to E major is a good way to practice both chord shapes together. Remember that with E major you're strumming all six strings, while with A major you're only strumming the top five strings.  While there is a more complex version of the F major chord that is a bar chord, you can learn a three-note F major chord that is much simpler. The key difficulty for you in playing the F major chord may be strumming the right strings.         To make an F major chord, put your first finger on the first fret of the B string, your second finger on the second fret of the G string, and your third finger on the third fret of the D string. You probably recognize this configuration as the same you used for C major, just on different strings. When you strum F major, you only want to strum the three strings that you've fretted. Don't strum the low E, A, or high E strings.  Now that you know eight chords, there are hundreds of popular and classic songs you should be able to play. Search online for tabs of songs that you enjoy. Take it slow, concentrating on one song at a time until you get to the point that you can play it without the tab.         For example, since you know G, F, and C, you can learn Sympathy for the Devil by the Rolling Stones, which uses those three chords. There also are a wealth of popular songs that use four chords. In fact, C, A minor, F, and G make up the most popular chord progression for country, rock, and popular music. Note that if you find the F major chord difficult, you can transpose the chords and play G, E minor, C, and D instead.	Memorize the names of your guitar's strings.

"Back to back" refers to a distance from the back of one 90º bend to the back of the other. In other words, this is the distance between the two parallel lines of a U bend, measuring from the outside edges. To create the first bend of the U, follow the instructions above for a stub up bend.  Measure the distance the two bends need to fit between, such as the distance between two parallel walls., Place the bent stub end of the conduit against a wall. Measure from this wall along your conduit, to the desired length. Mark the conduit at this length using a permanent marker or pencil.  Unlike the placement for the stub bend, the bender's handle should be pointed away from end you measured from. For bends like this, line the star symbol on your bender head up with the mark.If your bender does not have a star symbol, refer to your bender's instructions. If the distance between the bends is too short for your bender, use the stub up system instead. In other words, turn your bender the other way, subtract the take-up distance described in the stub-up section, and line the conduit up with the arrow mark instead.  Place the length of conduit you measured flat on the floor. Apply firm pressure on the foot pedal until the conduit bends to a 90º angle. Checking this angle with a level is highly recommended, since it's important that the two bends of the U are parallel.	Make a stub up bend. Measure the distance the conduit needs to fit between. Mark this distance on your conduit. Line the star symbol on the bender to this mark. Bend the conduit.
Headphones of a lower quality will cause you to turn your music up loud in order to hear it well. Headphones of a higher quality will allow you to lower the volume. This will allow you to hear the important things that are going on around you in public spaces.; , Not only is this bad for your ears, it completely blocks out all sounds around you leaving you unable hear important things like people yelling after you or cars beeping at you. This increases the risk of something dangerous happening to you or being caused by you.  These devices can easily snatched away from you by opportunistic thieves and are very expensive to replace. If you like to switch your songs a lot, make a playlist and switch your songs that way.  Look at them and acknowledge that they are there. If they are a stranger, say, "Hi" to them very kindly and avoid eye contact if having a conversation with them concerns you. If they persist in touching you, kindly tell them that you're not interested, and put your earphones into your pockets. This way they know you are fully aware that they are following you.  It may seem silly, but it looks like you are on an evening jog rather than trying to get through an urban neighborhood without trouble.  If you don't know where you are going, and are in a neighborhood that seems dangerous, take your headphones out to let locals know that while you may be lost, you are not too confused as to your surroundings.  If you see one that is bigger than yours, turn your head behind to check and see if anyone is there.  Often times, people think because you are listening to music you are completely oblivious of your surroundings. Make sure that every time you turn a corner there is no one behind you, and that people you've seen before aren't there anymore.  A lot of individuals often find it funny to intimidate the public. When you ignore them, it makes them feel insecure, and they end up looking stupid. Just jam to your music and enjoy your day!	Get the right headphones. Don't turn your headphones up too loud. Keep your musical device in your pocket, especially if it is a smart phone or iPod. Respond when someone taps you. Walk fast while you listen to music. Know your route. Look at shadows on the ground. Look behind you every time you turn a corner to make sure no one is following you. Ignore people when they yell at you.
White roses work especially well for this exercise: Like blank canvasses, they're easier to transfer colors onto than other colored roses.; , Have enough water in the pot so that you can fully submerge your rose petals after it has come to a boil. How much water you put in will therefore depend on the type of pot you use.  Many people prefer to use Rit dye, although other dyes or food colorings can easily be used. Depending on the amount of water in the pot, add anywhere from 8 to 15 drops. More drops will help achieve a deeper color.  Make sure that you have dissolved the salt in the dye. Salt helps the color adhere to the flowers. 1 teaspoon should be sufficient for a medium-sized pot of water.  The hotter the water is when you submerge the rose petals, the deeper the color will be. The cooler the water when you submerge the rose petals, the lighter the color will be.   You can actually get a pretty cool, "airy" effect with your dye by submerging the petals into cooler water for less time. Many people prefer this type of color to the uniform, deep color of hot water dyes. ,	First, take a dried rose, making sure that it is completely dry. Fill a pot with water and bring it to boil. Add the dye to the pot after the water has come to a boil. Add a little bit of salt to the water. Insert the roses petals into the mixture. Hang the flowers to dry from a wire rack or other safe location.  , Finished.
'Limelight' is occasionally attacked by slugs, snails, aphids, spider mites, spittle bugs and thrips. Check the leaves for snail and slug activity. They chew on the flowers, leaves and stems., If they become a problem, either pick them off the shrub in the morning and drop them into a bucket of soapy water to drown or sink tuna or cat food cans into the soil around the shrub and fill them with beer.   Snails and slugs will crawl into the beer and drown. The edge of the can should be level with the surrounding soil. Check the cans each afternoon. Dump the dead snails and slugs into the garbage, replace the cans and fill them with fresh beer.  Aphids are little soft-bodied, slow-moving insects that can be almost any color.Spider mites are actually tiny spiders that can barely be seen without a magnifying glass. They spin a fine webbing between the leaves and stems. Thrips are also very tiny. They are yellow to black and leave black excrement on the undersides of the leaves which take on a dusty appearance as the thrips feed. The flowers usually develop brown streaks. Spittle bugs are 1⁄4 to 1⁄3 inch (0.6 to 0.8 cm) long and can be brown, green or yellow. They deposit a frothy white substance on shrub stems.  All of these insects suck plant juices from the leaves and stems of shrubs. They can usually be controlled by spraying 'Limelight' in the morning several times each week with a forceful spray from a garden hose. Be sure to spray the tops and bottoms of the leaves as well as the stems.  Insecticidal soap is available already diluted in spray bottles or in concentrate form.   Insecticidal soap concentrate is commonly diluted at a rate of 5 tablespoons (73.9 ml) per gallon of water. Spray the shrub in the morning or evening. Spraying it in the afternoon when the sun is hottest or when temperatures rise above 85 °F (29 °C) can cause damage to the leaves. Hose the insecticidal soap off the shrub after an hour or two. The soap will only kill the pests that are sprayed. There is no benefit to leaving it on the shrub and it could damage the leaves.	Check your plant for pest activity. Combat slugs and snails. Know what aphids, thrips, spittle bugs, and spider mites look like. Use water to combat these pests. Spray the shrub with insecticidal soap if the pests persist and are causing serious damage.Be sure to coat the tops and bottoms of the leaves and the stems until the soap begins to drip.
They could yield some extra money and free up some valuable space in your home for other uses. LPs (long-playing 10 and 12 inch discs, playing at 33 1/3 revolutions per minute), 78s (somewhat breakable discs, playing at 78 revolutions per minute with one tune on each side) and 45s (7 inch discs playing at 45 revolutions per minute) could prove valuable. , How available is the record? If millions were initially sold, it is likely that many will turn up in thrift shops, used record stores, and many homes. The scarcity factor must be present. There must be a demand for that record because of the artists performing (for example, a major talent who died young, before being able to make many records), the label on which it was recorded (the original recording as distinguished from a "reissue"), or an oddity concerning the record (for example, a V-disc, wartime government recording, an air-check taken from a radio broadcast, an original picture disc, or a 10-inch LP). The scarcity factor can also be affected by whether a record is "out-of-print" (no longer available from the manufacturer), thereby decreasing the supply. "Bootlegs" (records illegally produced from live concerts or broadcasts) are also valuable to collectors., If it is in "mint" condition (perfect) or "near mint" condition, it will have the highest possible value. A record in "very good" condition should not have any distorted sounds or loss of sound quality. "Good" means it may have some imperfections, but can be readily enjoyed. "Fair" means it can play, but it will have obvious sound impairment and detract from your enjoyment and the value of the record. Those with surface noise and scratches will be of little or no value. Some dealers may have a slightly different grading scale., Generally speaking, there is more interest in music than in spoken word or comedy records and the value would therefore be greater. Certain kinds of musical recordings bring high sales prices. Jazz records and original Broadway cast and movie soundtracks tend to provide a more active market and greater value. Also, early rhythm and blues records and the doo wop sound are highly valued and collectible. Among classical records, the most valuable are orchestral performances, then solo instrumental, chamber music and concertos, solo vocal and operatic arias, and finally, complete operas. To some collectors, whether a record is mono or stereo affects the value. See the Tips below for emerging trends., Records are purchased by collectors, mail order dealers, used records stores, and the general public (sometimes on a nostalgic impulse or because of a favorite artist. Also, some audiophiles believe the sound quality produced by vinyl is greater than that of a CD or other media format). For truly rare records, the best prices will come from dealers who know the market and how much they can resell them for. Collectors are emotional and sometimes fanatical about collecting their specialties. They may pay top prices for particular idiosyncrasies. It is unusual to get top dollar for a rare record from the "general public," where only the performance value is recognized, not the resale or trading value., Painstaking research along with knowledge of the record industry and its artists is required to determine the value of a particular recording. It may be possible to determine a value for a "rare" record once you have determined that it is truly rare. For more on pricing, check the tips below., List the artist, the title of the record, LP, 45 or 78rpm, the record catalog number, and its condition., Take the list to a record librarian, a local record store or some used record stores for offers and indications as to rarity.

If you want to display your collection you will want to have some form of presentation to avoid just lining things up in a row (though sometimes that's the best way to go).   Do you want you collection to look creative or do you just want it to be displayed for the purpose of organization? If you are collecting figurines, do you want your characters to be in action poses and dioramas, or do you want them in categorized rows?; , If you want everything to be neat, you can organize your collection into categories. For example, you can display your state coin collection by year they came out. This will give your collection a cool "museum-like" look. If you have action figures, you can recreate scenes from the appropriate TV show or movie. Make sure you have appropriate boundaries between scenes to avoid making your collection look like a jumbled mess.  Consider putting some funds into:   Display stands. For collections with large objects, (figurines, porcelain, models) use stands and risers to provide more space and provide a better look. Shelves. For any collection, shelves can be used if cabinet, table or desk space is not available. These also help elevate your collection to eye level making them easier to look at. Card/coin books. If displaying your collection to yourself and not outsiders your goal, you should consider buying coin or card books with plastic pockets to protect and cleanly display your collection. Tables, desks and cabinets. These will be your main form of displaying along with shelves. Tables and desk provide plenty of space to lay out comics, create dioramas, place model trains etc.  To create more presentation and to make it look like you have a lot more items, mix and match the items in your collection. Don't just keep your posters in one place and your comics in another. Create tribute shelves to your favorite football player or line up three rare comics behind a cool-looking Spider-Man figure. Be creative in doing this, you can add collectible stickers or other odd-ball items around your centerpiece on a shelf to add background.  If none of the above works, you can find other ways of putting shelves and tables to fit your collection. Consider devoting an entire room or wall to your collection so you have some idea of the amount of space you have. Look at other peoples collections to get inspired.  Keeping a list of what you have and what you want is a great way to ensure that you don't accidentally buy duplicates or forget about the items that you'd love to have. The most basic way to track your collection is with software like Microsoft Word or Excel. Depending on what you collect, though, there are websites that might cater to your specific tastes.	Ask yourself how you want to see your collection. Categorize. Invest in accessories. Mix and match. Be creative!, Track your collection.
You can start with two empty toilet paper rolls or one empty paper towel roll.   If you use the paper towel roll, cut it in half. Refer to each half as a separate roll for the remainder of the instructions. Cut one of the rolls in half. Save one half for use as the cow's head and discard the other half. Cut 1 inch (2.5 cm) off one end of the other roll. This roll will become the body of the cow. Discard the excess 1 inch (2.5 cm).  Using pencil, lightly sketch two ovals onto one end of the head piece, positioning them on opposite sides of the cylindrical perimeter.   These ovals will become ears. Each one should be about one-quarter the length of the tube. Carefully cut along three-quarters of each oval outline, leaving the innermost end of each oval alone. Fold up the cut portions so that they stick out from the sides of the tube, creating ears.  Draw two small triangles near one end of the tube, centering them in between both ears.   These triangles will become horns. They should be smaller than half the size of one ear. Carefully cut along two edges of each triangle, leaving the innermost edge alone. Fold up the cut portions so that they stick out from the side of the tube, creating horns.  Cut two compartments out of an empty egg carton. Discard the rest of the carton.   These two sections will become the legs of your cow. One section will form both front legs and the other will form both back legs. Carefully cut out the front and back of both sections, leaving the sides and bottoms intact.  Paint both cardboard tubes and both egg carton sections white. Allow the paint to dry.   You should paint both sides of the ear slits, but you do not need to paint the horn slits at this time.  Use black paint to add spots to the head and body of the cow. Let the paint dry when finished.   To create realistic spots, paint spots with uneven sides. Avoid sharp points, opting for rounded corners instead. Note that you should also space the spots apart in uneven intervals instead of creating patterns or symmetry.  Paint a small pink oval in the front side of each ear. Paint both sides of each horn gray. Let the paint dry.   The pink inner ear should follow the outline of the ear slit, but you should leave some blank white space around the edge of each center.  Using craft glue, adhere two googly craft eyes onto the face. Allow the glue to dry completely.   Both eyes should lie just in front of the ears along the length of the head. Place each eye in between one horn and one ear along the width (perimeter) of the head.  Glue both egg carton pieces onto the same side of the body roll. Glue the head onto the opposite side of the body roll.   Turn both carton sections upside-down so that the flat bottoms become the tops. Place one section near the front of the body and the other section near the back. With the cow standing on its egg carton feet, glue the back half of the head onto the top of the body.  Once everything dries, stuff cotton balls into both open cardboard rolls.   Use enough cotton to tightly back both rolls. If you pack it tightly enough, you should not need to use glue to hold the cotton in place.  Cut a small piece of pink pipe cleaner out and glue it to the cotton at the front of the face.   The pink pipe cleaner should roughly match the diameter of the cardboard tube. Bend the pipe cleaner into a slight curve to give the cow a smile. Use glue to attach the pipe cleaner to the bottom half of the cotton at the front of the face.  Cut a small length of white yarn. Use glue to attach one end to the top of the cardboard body at the back of the cow.   The tail should be at least as long as the diameter of the tube, if not a little longer.  The cardboard cow is finished and ready to admire.	Cut up the cardboard tubes. Create ear slits. Snip and fold horn slits. Cut out two egg carton sections. Paint everything white. Add black spots. Define the ears and horns. Attach the eyes. Glue the pieces together. Stuff the rolls with cotton. Attach the mouth. Add a tail. Observe your work.
